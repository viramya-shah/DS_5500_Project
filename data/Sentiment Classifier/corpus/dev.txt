__label__5 We recently moved to a new building about 5 miles from my former residence. My phone number was changed because of this location change. My old phone number was therefore disconnected. "Comcast.net" terminated my email service when my phone number changed. Also my current building is serviced by "rcn.com" (not by comcast.net).Comcast terminated our service when we were assigned a new telephone number in a part of the city which is not serviced by Comcast. Comcast will not release my Address Book information unless I re-open a Comcast account. But Comcast does not provide internet service in my apartment building and in the neighborhood where I have moved to. Comcast wants me to re-open my Comcast email account but they do not provide email service where I now live. How is this solution by Comcast possible??
__label__0 I have been without phone service for 5 days and they failed to show up for am appointment.  I have three small children so this is not acceptable.  Please help me as they locked me into a contract and provide poor service and keep raising the costs each couple of months.  This is not fair!I cannot call 911 as I do not have phone service!
__label__1 I was using AT&T 3Mbps internet earlier and never had any complaints, but as my new apartment has Comcast internet I went on with Comcast 6Mbps assuming I would get double the speed which is more than enough for me. But I noticed that I could not do Facetime, stream music or have fast browsing etc, then I did a speed test to realize that I was only getting a max speed of 1-2 Mbps and never more than that when I am paying for 6 Mbps. I called the customer care, and they tried trouble shooting and they said "You should get at least half the speed," and that's the max they can do. I was SHOCKED. They also mentioned that my package is 25 Mbps which was hard to believe, and they did something from their end to get 6 Mbps speed which was only for some time. When I checked the speed in the evening the story repeats, so I called them next day and they said they will send their technician to troubleshoot. Asked me to signup for their Service Plan, otherwise they may charge me for the technician visit. Technician came, checked the speed and went on call for 15 mins to come back and say that my package is 6 Mbps and so they can't guarantee more speed (1-2 Mbps) which was very disappointing. He says, "WiFi is like that. We can't do anything." Such a lame excuse from XFINITY. I thought I would try for few more weeks, but it is no better.I am very disappointed to waste the Installation charges ($49.99) and the modem cost ($140) which was again suggested by them. Stay away from Comcast XFINITY.
__label__0 The service technician cut multiple building cables, removed a 4 to 5 ft piece of each cable during installation of service in a neighbor's unit. It disrupted service to 2 of 3 units in a 4-unit townhouse building. Another technician repaired two of three cables but refused to replace the third. I want the cable repaired. It's part of the building wiring. I am a long time customer who they do not seem to care about. I've got nothing but the run-around from Comcast support people. I waited all day for the technician since half of the work had to be performed in my unit. And then he refused to repair the cable to my unit. Without satisfactory resolution to this problem, I will initiate a police report against Comcast for willful destruction of property. I will call the States Attorney office after speaking to my lawyer. I will call the BBB and the local radio and newspaper offices and raise the level of attention concerning field technicians behavior and lack of customer service/satisfaction. The service technician seem to be putting customers in the middle of their ****  contest with Verizon. It does not appear to me to be a very smart thing to do. Facility wiring was destroyed. It was done in such a way that it is difficult to repair without access to multiple units.
__label__1 Getting calls from Comcast or making calls to Comcast makes me want to vomit! I'm a senior age 78 and wife 78, and we get all these phone calls soliciting services from Comcast. These calls cause us to get out of our chair or quit bathing or use other methods to get to the phone to listen to some uneducated robot go through a solicitation. Trying to get into your system to stop these calls is nearly impossible and requires sitting and listening to automated music and messages only to finally fall asleep or hang up. Your company really demands a competitive market or management with some with more than Burger King mentality. We, seniors, do not deserve to be abused this way which includes the loud advertisements when the sound automatically goes up so you have to get up and again, get the remote and shut the thing down or off. Your company has to have the worse public image of any company ever on the earth. I hope one day, management has the need to call their doctor and be put on hold while the nurse plays a message about all the surgeries and techniques they offer their patients and they can combine these treatments maybe to offer a brain transplant but offer that sweet music like your time is of no importance. Take heed. The customers have the last word and competition will correct this problem.
__label__1 My horrific experience started this past January, when I signed up for Comcast. I scheduled an installment, but when the gentleman arrived, He said that he would have to have a line dropped to the house in order to give me the whole package that I was paying for. He did set me up for basic cable, but I was paying for On Demand, and all of the movie channels, the internet and a phone, all of which were not working. He said that they would have to have a surveyor come out and mark, and then someone would have to drop the wire, and THEN, I would have to call them to set up ANOTHER appointment for them to come out and finish the install. It sounded like a lot of inconvenience on my part and taking off another half vacation day at work, but I really didn't see a choice.Three weeks later nothing had been done!! In the meantime, I had to have Verizon come and install temporary internet. They also had to drop a wire, which was completed that day! After more calls than I can count with people who didn't have any correct information, and 5 weeks total, I finally got them to finish the job. In the meantime I had already received two bills for the full contract. I tried to explain to the billing department, but the whole thing was either too complicated for them, or they simply didn't care.About a month later, my cable went out, for no reason. I spent over an hour on the phone with some tech guy, who couldn't accomplish anything, and had to make an appointment for someone to come out. They couldn't accommodate my work schedule, so I had to make arrangements to take another half day off. When the guy showed up, he told me that the equipment that had been installed was old equipment, and could not accommodate the up-to-date system. HUH??? A vacation day wasted, two months, and I actually had what I had ordered. That was April.In July, I returned home from a trip to find the cable, internet, and phone all out. I called customer service, and was on for another hour while he tried to send signals. He finally said that they would have to come out. I explained that I didn't have any more time off of work and I would need an evening appointment. He told me that they don't provide that. Three days later, I finally, got a friend to wait for them. When they showed up, they determined the problem was in a box underground, and that they would have to send a field tech. Surprisingly, they were able to solve the issue and found that a connector had blown in the underground box. Great!Two days later everything went out again. I called, yet again, and spent half an hour trying to explain to the tech guy, that there wasn't a problem in the box. He also said that he couldn't get me an evening appointment, but did tell me that they do provide evening appointments. I scheduled an appointment a week out, in order to get an evening appointment. Yesterday was that appointment. I got a call from the tech asking me if he could show up at 2:30 instead because I was his last call. I explained that I was at work.When he did show up at 5pm, I was unfortunately caught in traffic and arrived at 5:04 for a 5-7 appointment. Triwire Engineering Solutions truck was parked on the street in front of my house. The first thing I saw when I walked around the back of my house looking for the tech, was one of them urinating on my tree! The appointment went down from there. They didn't know what they were doing, and after restarting my box, and nothing happening, they told me that they really couldn't help me, and that I should call Comcast! What??? I told them that was who I called, and they said that they were just contractors. I told them that they could not leave until they had, at least set up a plan to get me back up and running.During the next two and a half hours, the lead guy told me that I was the problem, and the trainee with him told me that Comcast has the worst customer service, and that the plan being put in place by their supervisor was "ridiculous and stupid." When I went inside the house for a second, they jumped in their truck, and took off. I had to call Comcast again, and set up an appointment for a field tech, one more time. This time I, apparently, don't have to be home, and he is supposedly there right now fixing the problem.Where are the people running this company? Are they too busy to provide a product and service that they are charging ridiculous prices for? How do they stay in business? As soon as I can, I will be switching companies, but I need more vacation time first, and enough time to talk to their billing department about the contract they hooked me into!
__label__0 I am writing to regards to my credit report.  At one time, approximately 6 six years ago, I lived in Lake Ridge, Virginia.  I was receiving Comcast services during the time that I was living there.  However, once I moved out Comcast continued to bill me for four consecutive months afterwards. The bill accrued over $150. I disputed it because I no longer lived at the residence, and they said that they would decreased the bill to $70.00 and if I brought in the lease agreement stating my last day living at the address then they would clear the account completely.  The next day I brought them the lease agreement.  I spoke to a supervisor at Comcast and the indicated that they would fix the billing.  However, recently I checked on my credit history, and it indicated that the billing from Comcast had gone to a collection agency.  I feel that the supervisor that I spoke with (I dont recall the name) dropped the ball and did not take care of the clearing and crediting my account, and that my credit report should not have this incident on it.  Can you advise me on how to resolve this matter?  I have gone to Rolling Brooke Rental Office to retrieve a copy of my rental agreement but to no avail.  They do not have records that far back.  And I have gone to Comcast and they couldnt find any record of my account.  So where do I go from here.  I want my credit report cleared.  I was under the impression that it was clear up until one month ago.   My beacon score is affected.  I do not want this on my credit report.  I want it removed.
__label__1 This is COMPLAINT about the IGNORANT company Comcast. During the first week of December 2014 I started having problems with my Comcast internet connection. Web pages would stop loading or wouldn't load at all. The lights would go out on the modem I own & then come on again within 2 minutes. I hoped that it was a temporary problem & would fix itself. It got worse & happened more often & I waited until Mid-January to make my first call to Comcast's so-called customer service line. I don't remember how many calls I made in January but I am sure it was much more than one before a service call was scheduled. The guy that came out replaced worn parts on the outside line or lines. He also told me that my neighbor across the street was having the same problem.The Comcast guy said there was work or an upgrade being done to the system which was causing the problem. He told me to call again at the end of February if the Comcast internet connection was still not working properly. For a few days after he left it worked properly & then the problem got worse than it was before the supposed January repairs. I called Comcast's so-called customer service line again at the end of February the guy that was sent out did nothing & claimed the Comcast internet connection was working properly. The problem continued & got worse. I called & called & called. No one knew what they were doing or how to arrange to have the problem repaired. Comcast has no idea the stress they caused me.Comcast has a department called retention or as they answer customer solutions. THEY ARE A JOKE!!! They have no way of communicating with the local people. They claim they do but believe me they don't. On a Sunday afternoon in early March 2015 I was called by a Comcast guy who said he was from the local office & we had a long conversation about the problem & I agreed to take my self-built Windows 7 computer to a local shop for a complete diagnostic. I also agreed to replace my modem if my computer had no problems. My computer was working perfectly so I replaced my modem on a one-time free replacement warranty. This was the third modem in 2 years with Comcast. The problem continued. So then in April or May 2015 a local field supervisor called & agreed that the cable that was installed by U-verse in 2009 that runs 2/3 around my home should be replaced along with the rest of the cables He offered to give me his personal cell phone number but I told him to give me only his work number. I left about 10 messages with him over a week & I never heard from him again. 4 times I had to cancel because of bad weather & road construction in front of my home. Finally I thought I had it arranged just after Memorial Day to have the cables replaced. I asked the guy as soon as I opened my front door if he knew what I was told would be done. He didn't & I told him to leave. I did the same thing on June 1, 2015 for the same reason. The problem continued & I kept calling. Comcast's so-called customer service line is a JOKE & I am being extremely nice when I say that. The vast majority of people at the Comcast so-called customer service line have no idea what to do about a severe problem & so many of them have such heavy accents I couldn't understand them. The problem after nearly 7 Months finally started getting better & since May 29, 2015 is working properly. I deserve to know what caused the problem & how & when it was fixed. It remains to be seen if it will stay that way & if it doesn't I will be calling them again.
__label__0 I called comcast to set up cable after finding an authorized comcast dealer web site offering cable for 39.95 month with $75 cash back. Promo code 9299.  After talking to a rep for 30 minutes she went to this web site -- comcast's own website -- and said, Oh that's not offered in your area and tried to sell me the same service for 89.95 a month. This is outrageous. There is no choice. You cannot choose which channels you want.  They are a monopoly in our area and the prices just keep going up.  Where's the competition?  Why do they have the right to do this?  I've written to my senators but have heard nothing about regulating the cable companies.
__label__1 I had blast for over 2 years. Recently Comcast increased my price to $70 from $40 and told me that my speed is increased to 75 mbps. In reality I was only getting 1.5-2 mbps. I contacted service just to go through the monkey drill of power off, disconnect etc., nothing changed except that the support said sorry and disconnected abruptly.
__label__0 I canceled Comcast service at the end of October 2009. I had a refund of over $93. After waiting 6 weeks for my check to arrive, it finally arrived (with the amount of $5.73). I called customer service and was told that Comcast did a query using my phone number and mistakenly linked it with a former account that also had the same number (in the past). Without any further research (perhaps by customer SS#), they determined that it was my account that had the balance and decided with take the $88. I was told that my case would have to go to collections now, which means that Comcast is again withholding my money for an undisclosed amount of time. I informed them that I would be writing the FCC about Comcast's bad business practices, as well as the BBB. I was then given the Executive Office's number and told to call them.
__label__1 A Comcast representative decided it was ok to park in our driveway without asking to perform service at another address. He never asked permission to park in the driveway and occupied the space for over a half hour. When asked to move his van, he said to get out of his face and then threatened me by saying you better walk away. Not only did he park in the driveway but he took up 2 spaces.When he decided to leave, he stopped his van to further threaten me and my wife. I filed a criminal complaint with the Ocean City, NJ police department. The incident took place in the 4800 block of Ocean City in the evening between 6:45pm and 7:45pm. Is this the quality of service to be expected by Comcast? He was not even working on our property. His name is Joe and I provided further information to the police.
__label__1 On 29 Jul 2011, our cable service was interrupted.  We got an error code on our TV (0S00) and a message to contact Comcast.  I called Comcast and the technician on the phone confirmed that we had a weak signal to our home.  Proof of this was he was unable to reset our "box" remotely and suggested that they send a service technician to the house.  I confirmed with the service technician on the phone that this would not be at my expense.  He confirmed.  We were without cable for three days until a technician came to the house on Monday, 01 Aug 2011.  He was extremely nice and swapped out one of our HC set-top boxes and also confirmed that the signal strength to our house was indeed week.  He left and did some additional work at the cable box on the street (not in our home) and the service was restored. On 02 Sept 2011, I received my cable bill and saw a "Video Service Charge" for $27.00.  I called Comcast and confirmed with the billing agent that the charge was for the service visit on 01 Aug.  I explained the situation to the billing agent and she told me that they could not remove the charge for any reason.  I asked to speak with a manager or someone with decision-making authority.  I was put on a brief hold and Jose answered the call.  Not surprisingly, he was very defensive and not very cooperative initially.  I explained the situation yet again to Jose.  He told me that there was nothing he or anyone else at Comcast could do to remove the charge.  He offered to sell me a Service Protection Plan for $2.95 per month to avoid another service charge.  I initially declined his offer but was forced to accept this added charge in the end if I am going to get my recurring service issues addressed.  I explained to Jose that the service to my house is the issue and it is not something that I am responsible for.  I pay Comcast ~$150.00 per month for Voice, Data and Cable and they should be responsible for providing uninterrupted service to my house.  He did not agree with this.  When pushed further, he was willing to concede.  "If a tree knocked down the service lines to my neighborhood, this would be Comcast's responsibility, not mine."  In the end, he offered to credit my account $15.00/month for six months, which makes me financially whole but does not address the larger customer service issue that exists for all Comcast subscribers. If the service fails and the problem is with Comcast, why would individual consumers, such as myself, be subject to pay a $27.00 service fee?  And in order to avoid the service fee, my only option would be to subscribe to yet another monthly service, which is not fair to consumers.  Most people will simply agree and pay.  This is not right!
__label__0 HS Internet service quality has degraded to a point where it is not usable.  There have been occassional slow periods, particularly weekends when I try to handle my online needs.  However, these have gotten even more frequent.  Comcast claims there are no problems or upgrades going on, but they are doing something to cause issues that come and go.  Google will load sometimes and even run a search, but web pages more complex frequently fail during these outages.  E-mail won't function.  Can't pay bills or do homework that is a must have.  I'm going back to DSL and suggest anyone else who can do so.  Don't give Comcast any more power because they aren't servicing our basic needs.
__label__0 I have been a Cable customer with Comcast at my present address since June 2000. I have never had internet service through them; I have used AT&T DSL since June 2000. Due to many problems with my cable boxes I discontinued service with Comcast in June 2010, in doing so I received a paper statement the first in at least 3 years, on the statement I see that I have been charged for internet services of $45.50 per month, I have had auto pay with them since I began service.I called them in June after a technician picked up some of the boxes to confirm how to stop the auto pay. I told them that I had never had Comcast internet and she went back and saw that I didn't have one of their modems or record of a technician coming to install the service. She gave me a hard time stating that I should have looked at my bill, I told her that was none of her business but taking money from someones account without authorization for the services is illegal.She explained her supervisor was on vacation for the next week but she would have her contact me as soon as she returned. I never got a return call. I have called back several times having to explain the same story over and over. Today I gave it one more try over the phone, the man I spoke with said that he could only see back 12 months and put me on hold several times. And then the last time he said that it was going to take some time to get this explained to his supervisor and promised he would return my call by 8PM it is now 10:46Pm. I plan to go to the Comcast office near here and get copies of every bill ever sent to me and figure out how long I have paid for internet service that I have never had.
__label__1 I paid my last Comcast bill back in April. Then they sent a debt collector saying I didn't pay my bill. I contacted them and they said I didn't pay it even though it was reflected on my bank statement.
__label__1 My bill is so high, it is literally another house payment. I agreed for service in the amount of 159.99 every month with 10 dollars extra for other small cable boxes. We probably rent anywhere from 40 to 100 dollars in movies throughout the month (some are to buy that's why it is a high amount). I could not figure out why my bill was 800 dollars. Finally, I went into my local Comcast and had the manager literally walk me through charge by charge and payment by payment. Came to the conclusion that COMCAST bills you a month, sometimes a month and half ahead of time. So, I just called to find out how much I need to pay on Thursday. I must pay 385 for prior bill which I pay 380 dollars in Sept, but the bill was 765 so 385 carried over to this bill.I am so confused on why it is that high in the first place. They seem to dance around it when I am trying to understand. I can't pay that kind of money for Cable. That's insane. So I always just pay my past due. I am tired of not having a real reason as to why it is so extremely high. Anyways, so I have 385 due Thursday, then October's bill of 392 due on the 19th, THEN a new bill comes to me on the 24th (which is for Nov 3rd thru Dec. 4th). Why is the hell am I already being billed for months we aren't even in yet?They say, "It's for your convenience so you have it in advance and that's how the systems works." Well, I say it's because they want your balance to be high so your min. due is high which makes your past due high and most people can't pay that kind of money so they then get shut off and Comcast now get reactivation fees and late fees. I am appalled at them. I have gone through Comcast for about 15 yrs and they have become such scum. I am shocked. I wanted to write a review to inform people if they are struggling with their bill and can't understand why it is so high and where these fees are coming from, it is because they bill you for months that we aren't in yet! I really hope they change their "system". I am definitely ready to just go Netflix for good.
__label__0 We always paid our cable bill by going to the cable office. Now Comcast informed us that we have to pay $3.99 when we pay in person. What's going on with thes business' that they need another $3.99. This is a rip-off to the consumers and Should be stopped. It's hard enough coming up with the normal payment. Seems like every one is getting greedy. People like us on a limited income has it hard enough to pay for anything. Please, somebody, put a halt on all these business' who want more and more of our limited income!Because we pay in person and always on time, the extra money Comcast is wanting can cut into our medication funds. It has put my wife in a great depression and talking about going to Direct TV, but then we wouldn't have the local networks and we couldn't keep track of the weather in bad storms/
__label__1 I called on Jul 23 to cancel my TV (with Comcast), but keep the internet . The representative gave me a new lower rate if I kept both. I just saw my new statement and the rate never changed. I called back to get this corrected and they basically said, Sorry... you're not eligible for the lower rate regardless of what our representative told you on July 23. Low life bastards! If they are trying to get your service, they will give it away. If you are a long time customer paying out the **, it is sorry....we lied...
__label__0 A service was added to my account without my authorization. I did not realize this until the bill arrives and a $100 charge was added. After contacting Comcast the representative indicated a request was made on December 16th to add additional the service. I made no such call. The only call I made during this period was due to a cable box issue. The box is always going out, and I never received the box I am paying for, which is a DVR (this has been going on for 3 years).The Comcast representative could offer no proof of the request other than to say it was made by a man. Since I would be that man I know no such request was made. Comcast would not remove the charges so I paid $100 for a service I did not request or take advantage of. How can they get away with this? I bet there was a promotion going on and the customer service representative I talked to about my cable box issue added the service to get credit for a sale. This is theft, pure and simple.
__label__5 After not having cable, phone or internet services for over a month, a Comcast representative came to my door with a check for $300 something. Two weeks later, I still don't have any services so I called Comcast and asked what the problem is. The billing department was so inflexible and said it wasn't their fault, the payment had not been received so I was told that I had to make another payment, that they will add a note stating that if the check was ever deposited, I will be refunded. This is where the lies all happened. After about 1 week, the check mysteriously appeared. This was 3 weeks later. Now, Comcast has taken over $750.00. After many calls with several different supervisors, I was told that nowhere in their system is such note about me getting my money back existed. Incredible. "The calls are recorded for quality", what ** quality? I was not able to pay all my rent. The representatives and supervisors were nothing but disrespectful, condescending and to this day, almost a month later, I still have not received my money. Bunch of thieves. It was all your company's fault. The only reason I still have your ** product is because there are no other options. I can for sure tell you that you are nothing but thieves and as soon as my "credit" that you say I have runs out, you will never ever be part of my family. You good for nothing liars.Upper management should have taken the time to read the supposed notes or at least listen to the multiple calls both my husband and I made as well as all the promises your reps made to us. Once more, thank you for nothing rats.
__label__0    I am an IT professional who is very proficient in Computers and Networking.  I fully understand how this stuff works.  That's why I cannot understand why comcast is so flaky lately.  Their customer service is horrible, but usually I never have to be bothered with interacting with that bunch. Comcast has been pretty good.  I have been a customer for 6+ years, only subscribing to the basic cable internet service for +/-$40 a month.  I noticed about 2 months ago the service was becoming more and more intermittent.  Basically I lose all connection to the internet.  Sometimes the modem does this slow blinking thing that resembles a modem firmware upgrade or ip reconfiguration.  Sometimes the modem looks like it is operating normally, but it cannot connect to any remote server. I would go on and on about my nightmare experiences with the customer service clowns and the "support techs", but is gives me a headache just thinking about it.  Plus I know that it is just a big charade that is put on to portray competence and give us the feeling that "somebody is working on my issue".  Basically, they need to fix their problems before I decide to go with the less expensive and seemingly more stable DSL solution. What irritates me is that they have the $ to fix it, but they are unwilling or unable to fix it.\ Basically, they need to fix their problems before I decide to go with the less expensive and seemingly more stable DSL solution.

__label__1 I've been trying to give Comcast my money for service for three weeks. I had someone come out to enable the service, didn't even need them to hook up the connections because I'm very capable of that. The tech finds that the cable is not giving a signal and says a new cable has to be run and that they are not allowed to run cables in apartments. So I go to my apartment complex and ask them to do it, they say it is not their responsibility and that Comcast should do it and they gave me the apartments personal Comcast reps number. I call that rep and he says that the tech was supposed to set up an appointment for someone to come fix the "pre-line cable", not run a new cable. So now I'm on hold to set up an appointment for them to come fix that cable so I can get go set a different appointment for someone else to turn on the service which they don't technically need to do anything at my apartment at that point since I will already have everything hooked, but I still have to pay for them to come onsite because there has not been service here for 12 months. All of that was after I spoke with customer service three times before trying to get a direct answer to a very simple question which I finally got after speaking to the third person. Customer service is non existent!
__label__1 Unfortunately I have been waiting since December to resolve a damage complaint and have made multiple calls to try to resolve the issue. Ticket ** (Comcast has extensive notes in their record). Additionally, I have been assured several times that my expedited ticket would be addressed immediately. I'm still waiting and getting more angry each time I have to call back.Long story short - I bought a new home, and on the day I moved in (Nov. 30) a Comcast installer came to hook up the cable. The installer drilled holes into my wall to the outside presumably to connect to the box. At that point he pushed a wall shingle off of the exterior and broke it, leaving a hole to the exterior that is not protected from the elements (not good in a New England winter). The installer then ran the cable out the wall and stapled it down the exterior wall breaking additional shingles, not saying anything to us about the damage and left. We had cable for about 45 minutes before it went out? We had to have another installer come the next week to get everything working. It was an absolutely unprofessional experience all around.To add insult the installer told us the jack that in the other room was working fine, it was not. We have now been charged because a service worker has come back to reconnect it? Needless to say this situation has been frustrating and has still yet to be resolved. I have been extremely patient with no result and am still in the same place months later and have upset my homeowner's association by having a hole in our wall. One last thing. The Comcast website is very frustrating, maybe its by design. I can't get logged on no matter what I try to do? Does Comcast care at all about their customers... you decide?
__label__0 Sales people and TV people have stated that if you subscribe to cable you will not need the box. Well thats not altogether true.  If you have basic cable without a cable box, you are forced to buy a more expensive service that includes a cable box.  I dont wont or need the extra benefits of this more expensive services all I want is basic cable.  Cable is expensive enough without being forced to purchase the more expensive service having to monthly rent the box from the cable company.  No one can tell me if I purchase the box from Best Buy will that make my TV work with the very basic cable service.  And now that I face having to buy something I cant use or have replaced my expired coupon.I must now upgrade my service and pay an additional monthly charge for the rest of my life for something I don't want.
__label__1 I have internet browsing issues now for over 2 weeks and when they scheduled a tech to come to my home he never showed up. This makes the second no show. Good customer service, right? This company sucks.
__label__5 A bundled package was purchased and installed on 06-29-2011. Part of that bundled promotion was that the consumer would receive a $200.00 gift card ninety days later. To date, I have not received the gift card and Comcast continues to provide me with the number to their call center that handles distributing gift cards. After contacting the center on several occasions, I was given a tracking number and advised they are waiting to hear back from Comcast. But after contacting Comcast, they only direct me to the call center.
__label__1 TV shows and On demand shut off and reboot all the time. Horrible time consuming setup, please fix this. Thanks, I can't get anything except 3 rotating dots.
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer for years and wanted service transferred to new address. A tech was in my neighborhood at the install time but went to house 2 doors down. He finally shows up at my house and because customer service got the address wrong I have to call and have the mess straightened out. I canceled an install with Frontier to stay with Comcast as they offered me a better deal. By 9:30 am we have everything straightened out and I should get a call from the local technician by 10:30 AM to tell me when they can come back and install. By 11:30 I call them back as I have not received my call to schedule the install. Customer service tells me I am next and I should get a call by noon. At 1:15 I call back, and am told again that I should get a call within the hour. It has been nothing but repeated "I understand your frustration" repeated in my ear for hours now!!!
__label__1 To reduce this saga will be a challenge. So, moved, Comcast only game in town - signed up for Double Play. Received the wrong box, had to go to exchange at a service center. (1st one they sent me to had been closed for 2 mos.) Got that done. Called about the bill which was way more than agreed to. Agent suggested I add Phone and drop movie pkg. lowering my bill. Okay (Netflix). Received email - looking good, 2 & 1/2 weeks later no modem and lost my internet. 4 hours no joke, in calls and 4 different billing amounts ($103 to 298) all the while still no gear. Not sure what I'll owe. Asked for a supervisor, apparently he was helping the Pope and still is (Left my number but no call). And finally they dropped the movie service within 24 hrs. Guess they got that part right.
__label__1 I'm so very upset at the price increase forced on all of us. I don't have cable so I've been hit with a $21.00 price increase per month. I only have internet & a land line. I heard all the spiel on how I was in a time line of a 2 year contract, 2014. B.S. I've only had it for one year. No employee could tell me what happened to the other year? My bill went up regardless. I hate cable company monopolies. We are all going to come up short in the end.
__label__1 The Comcast guarantee states that if not 100% satisfied, return the equipment before thirty days and money paid will be refunded. I had difficulties with the DVR and channels several times and contacted customer service with absolutely no help. I returned the equipment prior to the 30-day stated time period and was told by the woman at the desk, who reviewed my account, that I would receive a check shortly. The office in question is on Federal Highway, (US 1) Boca Raton/Delray Beach, FL. When no check was forthcoming, I called customer service by phone on three different occasions. I was told that the tech did not arrive at the location to disconnect the service until two days after the 30-day time limit, so I was not entitled to the refund.First, after researching your so-called "guarantee", it clearly fails to state this ridiculous inclusion of a tech physically disconnecting the service. Incredulous! What concern is it of mine how your techs are managed in the field and when they arrive to physically disconnect the service? Second, this one is truly ** as how could I use the service when the equipment was returned to a Comcast location? Who runs this company, Donald Duck? I want the refund due to me (approximately $139.00) ASAP. This fiasco took place in December, so I'm sure you can understand my anger. Unless you'd prefer me to continue this complaint to newspapers, federal agencies, BBB and FTC included, I suggest you remedy this mistake while you can.I will be your worst nightmare continuing this line of complaints including posting a sign at your local offices explaining the fallacy of your word to guarantee your service. Get on it and solve this ASAP. As you may have noticed, I'm not your standard everyday mindless customer and have attorneys in the family who would love to visit Philadelphia. Thanks for your "guaranteed" assistance.
__label__0 All I wanted was cable TV installed to one unit with DVR and wireless internet capability. A rep showed up on Monday, 8/3, and as soon as he left, everything died. He had the wrong box (with no DVR), and the box he left did not work adequately. I have spent the rest of the week (through today, 8/6) trying to get it fixed. They lie and say anything to get me off the phone.
__label__0 I have had Comcast "high-speed" internet for about 4 or 5 years now. This is only because they have a monopoly on the cable service here. Anyways, I have a stack of pink copies from technicians about an inch thick if I squeeze it together. Every time they manage to get it working right, it only takes a couple of days, weeks, months to go out again. The most recent problem has been occurring since I signed up for the double play option for both digital TV and high-speed internet. I already had both, but the customer service representative I talked to one night said that I could save some money by signing up for the double play, which, if you read their available options pamphlet, shows the same internet service that I was already paying for. Hah. The download speed stayed about the same, but the upload speed dropped from 2.5 Mbps to 1.5 Mbps, which is a big problem for any online gaming or uploading files.Also, since being put on the double play option, the internet has gone down almost every night - sometimes two or three times in the same night. The outages last from 15 minutes to several hours. I have called and set up technician appointments. Unfortunately, the problem does not seem to occur during the daytime hours that they can come out. The phone customer service people always verify that there is something wrong when I call and always want to send out a technician to check it out. But they can't or won't come out at night when the problems occur.The past week I have had two different technicians come to my home. One swapped out my modem because it was hot, but found no issues with the signal. It went out again that night, so I called again and they said it was a repeat so they would send out a more experienced technician. He came out and said my upstream power was fluctuating and he would get a line technician out probably late at night when the problem was occurring. Later that same afternoon, not at night, a line tech came out and did some work on the lines. He stopped by and said that he fixed something and to call them again if I still had problems. The next day, yesterday, the TV with the digital box hooked up to it went in and out all day on every channel and once again the internet went out at 11:30 p.m.I called the 800 number to tell them it went out again and the representative verified that the signal was not good. He wanted to set up another technician appointment. I told him that unless he could get someone here at night when the problem happens, it would not do any good. I know this from the past 4 or 5 years of experience with Comcast. They must be doing something at night that causes this problem and then switching it back during the day hours. Because at least 20 times technicians during the day come out and find no problems, yet the internet will still go down again that night or within a couple of nights. I usually don't have problems with the internet customer service phone people or the technicians that come to my house. Generally, they are pleasant and somewhat knowledgeable about what they can try to do to fix the problem - well, except when I have called the television service people who seem rather stupid.The problem I have is with their system or ability to provide the service that they sell. Because of that, I really wish that there were other options for the service in this area. Comcast would lose this customer. The politicians that allowed them to have a monopoly without ensuring proper regulatory policies were in place need to be out on their rear ends. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. Since I have had the double play, if I run a trace route (tracert), now the first hop always comes back with 3 time outs. The second hop comes back with times almost twice as long as it was before I got the double play. The double play says 2 Mbps upload speed in their services available guide, not the 1.5 that I get.Separate note: why do they not inform people that there is going to be scheduled maintenance in the area that night? At least then their customers could be prepared for the outage. Instead, the service just goes off and when you call you get a recording saying that it was planned. Apologies if this came through last night, but my internet went out again at about 1:00 a.m. and it didn't come back up until 10 minutes before the Comcast technician arrived this morning at 8:30 a.m.
__label__1 They ignored first amendment rights and ignored dispute letter for over-charging and making false charges for services not provided. Internet is for $29.99 or $10; cable, for $65.54 or $75.  However, Comcast wants $300 a month for services that were not given or started. This is fraud on the account.
__label__0 On August 16, 2008, I ordered the Triple Play. It had a rebate of 225 dollars. The rebate company is Bridgevin, 1-888-314-9903. They said that I would receive it in 10 weeks and now it is 5 months later and I still have not received it. I call all the time and they said it is still being processed.
__label__1 We had Comcast when we lived in Baltimore and had several issues, luckily Verizon offered cable and we were able to switch. We had Comcast/Xfinity at our house at least once a month with reception issues or simply no cable/internet service. Once we switched to Verizon we did not have a single issue, not a single issue. We relocated to CT, unfortunately our only option was satellite or Xfinity. We made the wrong choice. We live in an area with several trees and were afraid that would be an issue with satellite. Well it's been a year and a half, we've had a repair person or a hour plus conversation (after the usual unplugging the box repair) with customer service at least every other month. Once the contract is up we're going satellite of 100% smart tv. This is ridiculous. As I write this my tv is constantly pixelating, yes this is after the recommended "unplug the box" repair. P. S. I unplug this box at least 3x a week.
__label__1 I called COMCAST to get a Double Play Bundle Special. The advertisement baits you by quoting $89.00 for a double play. My final price was $133 if I wanted internet speed that actually worked. I was then quoted $79.00 for the double play bundle before all of the extras but I had to sign a two year contract. I think that it is next to impossible to get cable/internet for the advertised $79.00. Each month my bill has increased. A year later my bill is $195.00!! Each month they increase a different item on the bill. Sometimes they will actually overcharge for the number of set-top boxes that you have. It is next to impossible to get any item changed. If you get one price adjusted, they will overcharge you on a different section of the bill. The customer service representative who you initially speak with will promise anything to get you to sign up, then Comcast states that the charges are not part of the actual contract therefore, they can change them. I was told recently by customer service that the $79.00 was a limited offer discount, but that was the price I was quoted to sign up not a limited time special. When I called Customer Service (in the Philippines), I am told by the supervisor Al, "We can always change the price whenever needed". I signed a two year contract with the understanding that I was guaranteed the same price for two years. I might as well be speaking with a robot or a computer as someone in a call center who has no ability to assist me. If you are quoted one price to get you to signed the contract and you are charged another price- I believe it is called BAIT AND SWITCH which is a deceptive advertising practice, fraud, and it is a violation of consumer law. Comcast makes being a customer a painful, agonizing experience.
__label__0    In the month of November our services(phone,internet,and cable) with Comcast were cut off due to non payment. On Friday November 20th I had payed my bill to current status. When I called on Friday from my work phone(because I do not have a phone at home and no cell phone)Comcast said that they were going to send a technician out on Saturday from 8am-11am to set my service back up. I stayed home from work and I was up and ready at 8am. At 10:30am on 11/21/09 the techincian left a door tag saying he had missed me. I was there and there was no knock on the door. So I called again and told the man what happened. He said someone would be coming back out later that day. No one came. I called on Sunday 11/25/09 from my apartment leasing office. She said that she would call the technician and try to see if they could come out. She asked if I could stay were I was at to give me a call back. So I waited and waited for 2 hours in the leasing office. No call from Comcast. Then I called again on Sunday 11/25/09 and I talked to a lady named Heidi.Heidi was nice and sweet but she did not know what the heck she was talking about. She told us that we would have to have new equipment because our equipment was old. Not true at all. We have the updated versions of everything trust me, my husband wouldn't allow us to have outdated electronics. Then she said that we have to have another installation done on Sunday from 4pm to 8pm. I called on Sunday evening from Kroger which is a grocery store because I have no phone. When I called this time they said yes that a technician will be out and to be expecting him. Around 8:40pm no one had shown up. 
I went back to Kroger used the phone and finally talked to a lady named Ms.B. After all this run around she told me the truth saying that the technicians don't work on Sundays and they will not be out today. Then she explained that we don't have to be home because all the technician has to do is hook it back up from the box in the back of the apartment. She told me that they would be out on Monday to hook it up. Monday morning, 1 cable box is hooked up but the other t.v , phone and internet is not hooked up yet. So I called again and the lady sent a signal for the other t.v. to work which it did then she said someone is to be out Monday night for the phone and internet connection. No one came again. I called again on Tuesday 11/24/09 and spoke to a lady and said they would be out on Tuesday from 2-5p. My husband was home and no one showed up for the 3rd time. Tuesday evening and my husband called this time they said that our modem was on hold for the internet and phone. Why? I have no idea. They never told me why. So on Wednesday I called again and I told the lady and she transferd me to a guy and would finally resolve the issue. He took the modem off hold. I am sending this to you because there is no reason for this miscommunication from the employees at Comcast and they need inform the customers the correct information and not what they want to hear. Comcast has clearly not understood what it means about customer service. They give customers the run around. They also are quick to turn your service off when you don't make a payment but when you do make the payment they are not as quick to turn the service back on. I work and train on customer service to new employees. I would never train my employees to tell the customer what they want to hear and not get the issue resolved. Get the issue resolved period. There are no excuses. At 10:30am on 11/21/09 the techincian left a door tag saying he had missed me. I was there and there was no knock on the door. So I called again and told the man what happened.

__label__1 I had to cancel service with Comcast because I was moving. I had a few issues with being double billed and disputed charges. On September 7th I got a notice I had a credit of $80. On September 25th I got a bill from a collection agency for $ 110.00. The service from Comcast is terrible.
__label__1 Comcast internet service is unreliable. The internet speed is not what they claimed to be. I am only getting 3-5 mbps most of the time and always froze my internet connection. When you call their executive customer service, the calls get dropped the moment you complained about the problem. No more Comcast for me, sorry this is not the kind of service I should be getting from a customer who pays on time.
__label__0    My complaint is about services provided by Comcast Cable Services in Albuquerque New Mexico.  I recently acquired Comcast Cable and Internet Services for my Apartment Home.  By doing this it has led to Inconsistent services such as my TV reception, on-demand services and internet service to be inadequate.  I paid for these services to work when I called to have it installed over three weeks ago.  Angela who is a Sales person came out and installed cable wiring in a not so professional way.  Angela broke some sheet rock from a small corner on the bottom part of the wall.  The next day I switched out my cable box for the fix.  To this day Sep 24th 2009 I still do not have On-Demand working, and my internet is jumping from 468 kps to 1100 kps.  I took my cable modem in to have it changed today and a splitter.  They are installed and im still having a problem.  All this after having five techs come out to my apartment.  One of the Techs came out to my apartment and reported back that he was never here, the system says CANCELED.  I have been told by Mindy that i am not paying for on-demand it is part of my cable service and they give it to us free.  I pay for this as part of a package and it is important.  I pay for these services and wish to have them work or comcast should let me know this is the best they can do.  Then I can cancel!  Supervisors are not calling me back I called Executive Offices at: 1-215-665-1700 and spoke with an executive assistant.  Still no fix as of yet.  A customer should not be treated this way.  I have had cable 3 weeks and 5 techs came out, i am waiting for another.  This is ridiculous!  Can someone help to insure businesses do not step on the little guys.  What ever happened to quality service WORK and trust of companies.
__label__1 We got Comcast triple installed at our home we rent. The service guy came out and hooked everything up. He failed to give us our Internet password and that was December. I called several times and we still have no password. To top it off, we had the home security. We had it installed on the outside of our home because we HAD brand new snowmobiles and 2 new cars. Well, the tech failed to mention the camera doesn't record unless the alarm is tripped. With 2 large dogs and nothing fancy in our home, we placed the camera outside and obviously no one would break in our house when they could steal our $15,000 in snowmobiles. So that was never recorded because they didn't break in our house. Why the tech wouldn't inform us it was useless to put a camera outside is beyond me. So I call Comcast to cancel just the home security and they won't let me unless we pay a huge early termination fee.I start to get over all this terrible dealings with Comcast and we are moving again. I need to cancel Comcast altogether and once again they are fighting me on it. Again with the outrageous fees. So they hang up on me. Now I call back, someone will transfer me, and then hang up before the transfer person connects. It is almost like they red flag me so I can't cancel. They are impossible to deal with and completely unrealistic. It is the worst customer service I have ever received.
__label__5 I called Comcast and went over my bill with an associate. She explained to me how she could help me lower my bill. I thought wow, that's great! She explained everything to me, etc. Everything was all set. Later that same day, I went online to make my payment and it told me, "We're sorry, only the primary account owner can add or upgrade services. You are listed as a secondary user on this Comcast account, and are not eligible to make any account changes." What? I logged out and logged back in, but I got the same message.I called Comcast and spoke to someone who did not speak English very well. I could not understand her; she said she was in Puerto Rico. I asked her to transfer me to someone who speaks English. Well, she tried to transfer me and hung up on me instead. When I called back, I had to go through the automated system again, was on hold, and finally got to someone. She spoke English, but she said that she could not help and she had to transfer me to tech support. I was on hold again, when finally, tech support answered. However, she could not help me. She said, "I don't know why they transferred you to me. I can't do anything," and then she followed it up with, "The associate you spoke with must not know what she was doing." So the tech support transfers me back to customer service (by they way, as I'm typing this, I'm still on hold). My phone has a timer on it so 1 hour and 35 minutes is the correct time of being on hold. I explained the story to customer service. Mind you, all I want to do is pay my bill, give them money for the service they provide me.I asked the customer service rep if there is a discount she can give me and she said no. She said that she already waived the $5.99 fee from the automated payment on the phone. Well, I cannot pay my bill that way either. Their system is telling me my phone number is invalid and I cannot pay my bill online. Why would she not waive the automated system? It's not my fault that I can't pay my bill. All I wanted was some type of compensation or apology for the runaround. At this point, I'm waiting to speak to a manager and have now been on hold for 1 hour and 11 minutes. What's next?
__label__0 Despite numerous calls for many years, we continue to have interruptions in services.  Comcast does not seem to be able to fix this.  We live in the city proper.  Every service person who comes out has a different story.  People have arrived on our property unannounced without identifying themselves.    They also gave out my unlisted phone number to a telemarketing firm that worked for them and then denied it, even when I explained that there were very grave circumstances that required my number not be published or shared.  While I was recovering from surgery, I was plagued with these calls. Despite numerous calls to COMCAST this was not addressed.  They continue to substitute my broadband number for my land line number in spite of my requests not to do so.   Last week they came out to perform service and left the front door open in below 50 degree weather.  There was no need for this.  They let my pet who is on medication and elderly escape.  The supervisor said we should have told them that we had a pet.  We had to search for our pet and eventually found her.  The supervisor projected an attitude, complained that he had to come out on a Saturday, and also told us we should keep all the records of service calls since he had nothing beyond 30 days.  Their service is very poor and they always have an excuse.Infliction of emotional harm, hundreds of hours reporting problems and waiting for service people and explaining the problems all over again.
__label__0 When I moved to a new place I found out they had Comcast High speed and cable. I share the cable with three other people, and only 2 of us have a laptop. About 3 week's ago suddendly I lost all internet access so did my roomate.. I called Comcast a number of times and they are trying to tell me it's my computer, which is very strange since I have a PSP and a PS3 which is having the same problem. After weeks of calling them and pulling my hair out we cancelled Comcast and went to Verizon. We are not going to pay Comcast for something we cannot get.They should have stayed with TV service.
__label__1 I have signed up for Xfinity Triple Play including phone, cable, and internet. I was promised blast speed internet which I have not been provided since signing up on a 24 month contract. I have had several technicians out to my house to correct wrong/poor installation. First time when getting internet the tech spliced my TV and internet together causing slow speed and interference. Another tech came to fix. Another tech just came a few days ago and stated wrong cable was used and I would never get the speed. He had to replace line from inside my house to modem as well as the line outside running to the service box across from my lawn in a big green metal box. Several calls to Xfinity hours and hours of frustration as well as being hung up on. I was received internet around 35-40 in speed and blast is promised to run at 150 in speed. It was originally promised at 105. I am currently only running at 91.65 which can be validated on speed test link provided. I have been put on a 10 day extension to my bill and would expect credit for the breach of contract with Xfinity. Their response is I am on a promotion not even paying for it $13.00 per month is credit so maybe being I am on a promotion Xfinity thinks it's to not provide what was promised on my 24 month contract. I am currently on the phone with Xfinity after 35 minutes and being hung up on last night. After the rep told me it's the end of her shift then ask what a good number to call back at if disconnected, not more then 5 seconds later was I hung up on without a resolution or help. With my internet not working at all yesterday all day, I was able to finally fix on my own at 12:45 am.
__label__1 My experience with Comcast was like something out of a horror movie. First they was late, real late, then they left without hooking up all my services, then I call back only to hear them tell me a technician would be back until the next day. I don't recommend this company.
__label__0 I have attempted for three days now to contact Comcast regarding continual issues with accessing my email through their service. I keep getting a server issue error message. I have been unable to contact them via internet or telephone. The automated message keeps telling me they are experiencing "higher than normal" call volumes. Perhaps this means others are having the same problem. I am ready to drop the service as I have had ongoing unresolved issues with digital cable as well. I feel like I am throwing my money away!
__label__1 This is an example of how Comcast have left their installation at **, Savannah. Open to the weather and to any passing trouble maker. Total disgrace. Several attempts have been made for Comcast to fix this but no reaction. A poor statement of quality and will no doubt lead to service issues for the many customers. See pictures.
__label__1 We had our bundle cable, internet landline for almost 9 yrs. I always carried credit with this company as well. I am owed $398.27. I returned all their equipment and they gave me a receipt saying they had all of it. I would have my refund in 30 days. Now 30 days later I call and they try to say there is equipment missing. Issue a ticket **.
__label__1 I called in to ask about my bill. They said that they have a new promotion that I can apply. I think that's a good deal so that I agreed to join. At the end of the month, they sent me a bill for $263, with $15 installed kit for internet services. They didn't do a single thing. They scheduled a tech to come out to look to see why I couldn't connect to internet. Over the phone, the lady said that as long as that guy not doing inside my house, they will not charge me. Guess what, they charged me $35 and the tech didn't step a foot inside my house. They charged us $99 for upgrade to their new X1 Platform technology. We have to pay for their upgrade. I don't need X1 platform. And they didnt even mention that in the call. Do not even think about this company for internet and TV services. Comcast is the worst customer service. You will regret for sure.
__label__1 I am a business owner and strive very hard to get back positive reviews. However, this company here in Florida should not even be allowed to operate. My experience has been a fraction of what others have encountered but I cannot in good conscience keep silent. I hate calling customer service to be hung up on or be kept on hold for 20 mins. Unreal!!! What is so difficult? Send out your technician!!! Just Horrible!!! They don't deserve even 1 star!!!
__label__1 Every time my monthly charges change arbitrarily. I am never given an explanation as to why this happens. Their billing amounts are supposedly based on a 12 month billing cycle. However, this is what I have been billed for the last 12 months: 06/20/14 133.63, 07/10/14 80.36, 08/11/14 84.73, 09/10/14 84.73, 10/10/14 106.99, 11/12/14 106.99, 12/10/14 106/99, 01/12/15 106.99, 02/10/15 107.99, 03/10/15 107.99, 04/10/15 107.99, 05/11/15 120.38, 06/10/15 138.95.I protested against the last amount and was given an adjustment, so that my actual payment was reduced to $104.56 on May 20, 2015. In addition I was offered, and accepted a new 2-year contract with monthly payments of $89.99/mo for the next 12 months. However, in my latest billing the amount of the adjustment I had received on May 20 has been added on to my latest invoice, so instead of $89.99 I am billed $115.11! It is outrageous that this unethical conduct by this company is allowed to continue. Please let me know what steps are available to me to make Comcast adhere to its contractual obligations.
__label__1 Do not use Comcast. Their customer service is worse than being mugged. I asked for supervisor 4 times and was transferred back into random departments 4 times 2 of which were located in states where they could not even view my information. I had 3 associates from Comcast promise and assure me they would call me back that day and received no call each time. I had a supervisor call me back during the times I told the previous associate I would be at work. I called the number they left me and got no answer each time I called. Comcast is beyond horrible with customer service. If their goal is to deflect you until you quit they've perfected it... The tenacity needed to get a problem fixed with them is outrageous. Not to mention the multiple appts they have missed. I cannot wait to switch my service provider. I would take basic cable over all Comcast features at this point.
__label__1 Comcast/xfinity is a nightmare. If anyone can avoid them avoid them like a plague. They are deceptive, lying, manipulative, horrible slap-you-in-the-face business practices. They actually tell reps to lie, to be deceptive. Otherwise they can lose their jobs. Don't work for them. They will only steal the real true person you are and want to be. Only liars work for them. If you are a son or daughter of the great 'decepter' then you belong there.From day 1 they've overcharged me on things. After a year it finally got right then the 1 year promotion is over they charge me double. I upgrade, they do nothing in their promotion right. They start overcharging me again.
__label__1 I helped a friend set up a Comcast service. She's had service with them for over fifteen years and pays 180 dollars a month and they never cut her a break. I have a different carrier and I was using my phone to try to set things up. Now when I try to log on to my wifi at home it takes me to xfinity.com and I have centurylink. I want to cut off my connection with Comcast.
__label__1 I have trying to get a service for my business past two weeks and I just found out it will be another 3 weeks before they can do it. I can't get anyone on the phone who listens just to cancel. After 7 phone calls to customer service every single one of them puts me to a voice mail after I tell them not to do so. I just called Verizon FiOS and got my acct set up in 10 mins and getting my service set up in 3 days. I wish I called them before!
__label__1 My most recent bill came with an extra $100 due. After spending 80 minutes & talking to 3 different customer service reps, my bill was reduced by $90. During this time I discovered I had been paying for home security system, that I had for only 3 days, since November 2013! This was $30/month. They refuse to refund any $$ because it's too much! Worst customer service anywhere.
__label__0 I ordered a Comcast high speed internet connection. This was long time back. I went out of town for six months for work related reason and my internet connection setup was never completed. I spoke to Gavan, one of the customer service agent on June 5th 2009 to set up internet connection at my place and had really bad customer service experience with him. He started yelling at me on the call with high tone (high voice). When I asked for supervisor (Michael), Michael also supported him saying, "I know he was yelling at you," and acknowledged that he was standing next to him when he was doing so. Michael, being a team lead never apologized or tried convincing me. Instead, I hear his voice was too supportive for Gavan. I am very disappointed with this call and customer service experience with the Comcast. I would never ever recommend anybody in future to go for this kind of service and end up with bad customer service like this. I know Comcast might not take this as important, as they would lose only one customer but like this, there will be several others who might be the victims of such bad customer service and may think the same way. I am now switching to another service provider. I already have a Comcast modem, (which I paid $60 just for modem + shipping), which I purchased while placing an order. I wanted my money back but Comcast customer service is not even accepting the modem back. I was warned by my friends not to go with Comcast because they had bad experience with Comcast before but it was all my mistake or I would say "wrong choice". I don't know how to escalate this to the upper management in Comcast.
__label__1 We have a $300 cable bill and called to lower it. I spent over an hour on the phone with them (after waiting on hold for 20 minutes). I finally agreed to a $99.00 double play. TV and internet. We got rid of the landline. We got our bill but no change! I called them to find out what happened and the billing lady says there was a mistake made and I have to go back to the sales team. I was fuming! On hold again for 20 minutes! They wouldn't honor the agreement!! I asked to talk to management and she said the only thing they could do is email the manager and she said she would make sure she called today. It never happened! They never called. The worst customer service ever!
__label__0 I also have Comcast cable. In the last year, my signal quality has deteriorated significantly. I get out-of-sync, and dropouts. Many service visits have failed to fix the problems. Comcast service techs admit that the problem is with TV, internet and phone on the same cable, Comcast is delivering lower a lower quality signal.Also, Comcast has dropped at least 2 stations from their analog list and moved them the the digital list. I will not benefit from the digital conversion!I am paying more for less from Comcast and in Feb. 2009, I will be FORCED to pay for bad reception and reduced listings.
__label__0 Constantly having problems with Digital Voice, Cable and Internet Service. Constantly calling them OVER and OVER again. They have the most incompetent bunch of illiterates I have ever spoken to in my life. I am so frustrated! I wish I can cancel there service but they are the only cable company in my area. 
__label__1 Comcast is single-handedly the worst Customer Support I have ever encountered. I don't even know where to begin in my laundry list of horrible interactions. Most recently, after the standard 20-45 minutes of wait and "verification" process which requires everything but a blood sample, I was informed that my last request of downgrading my cable service was denied. DENIED. Now, I am going back to AT&T. Not a great option, but better than dealing with this monstrosity of a monopoly ever again.
__label__5 Had high winds knocking out my cable line. Made call day after knocked out and told that there was a problem in my area and would be fixed. Next call told to stay home, someone would be out the following day and to watch my cell phone from 8 a.m. No one came or called. Made another call. Told was given misinformation and no one was scheduled out until a week later. Three technicians did show up and said definitely the line. Did not fix, in fact, disconnected line. Made another call and scheduled a technician for inside so had to be home. Yep, it was the outside line - the one three technicians took down. How many days did this take - 17 days no service. And gave my cellphone number numerous times to call center because my phone is part of a bundle. Did they give the technician my cellphone number - nope! Customer service is not just about nice people on the phone. It is about resolving a problem or issue.
__label__1 DO NOT go with Comcast. MUST read other reviews. I had to wait 10 days for an installer to come in. When he did he had no idea what he was doing. Left after 4.5 hours saying he talked to his supervisor and they be back the next day to finish the job. He cut my old wires and just left everything unfinished. He gave me his supervisor's number. Next day came and no one showed up. I called the number, got a voicemail and left messages. Finally I called Comcast/XFINITY to find out I have a new insulation schedule between 4-6 pm six days later. To make the story shorts, after being online for over two hours the customer service "supervisor" promised they will call me back within an hour with a "Urgent" installation request! Of course that never happened so I called back, same song and dance with another agent!! Basically I have no other options but to wait another two days to see if anyone shows up! No internet or TV for 6 days because of these idiots!!!
__label__1 When you enter a number into your remote, such as when changing channels, should you have to wait for each number to show up? When you press the button for the previous channel, should you have to wait, sometimes as long as 5 full seconds, for the selection to show up on the screen? Five seconds doesn't seem like a long time until you realize how often you use your remote and that this lag is across the board. Everything you do with the remote has a wait time before it happens on the screen. Don't even ask me about on demand. We pay $160 a month for TV, internet, and home phone, and we get no DVR, more commercials, and we wait in line every time we push a button. BTW, we are locked in for 2 years of this? So upset with the wife for ordering this. A few years back I tried to find out how much Comcast would cost after their introductory price ended. Could not find that info online and they would not tell me when I called. Another time I called to suspend the service for a couple months. When I called back to restore it they had no record of the suspension and I had to pay for the service even though they showed that we did not use it for that time period. Typical monopoly behavior. When our 2 years are up, going to find internet service and try all the other options, Amazon Prime, Sling, etc...
__label__1 We signed a new contract to lower our monthly payment, and when the contract kicked in, we lost all our services. Comcast has yet to fix it and when we set up a service appointment for Dec 7th at 8am, our confirmation came back for 2pm. We were told we never had an 8am appointment. No one was able to help us and actually got offended that we were upset. We talked to 5 different people and when transferred, not one person explained the situation to the person we were being transferred to.
__label__1 Comcast never showed up for a scheduled appointment. They confirmed the afternoon before but canceled because of weather (which I understand) but never notified me they were canceling the appointment. No weather forecast changed from yesterday but they did not have the courtesy to let me know about the cancellation.
__label__1 The only service I'm getting from Comcast is a high bill. My service is hardly ever working & customer service are very disrespectful & always blame it on my computer or a virus. I've taken my computer in; nothing wrong. I've talked to Norton security; they said my security system is working & I have no viruses & the only thing not working is internet explorer. They just want to send a tech so they can charge me extra money. A tech came out in the past & said they didn't give me the right cords & the internet modem was jumping, so he had to get new cords & a different modem out of his van. But they still charged me on my bill; even though they say if it's their service that's not working, you don't have to pay. I shouldn't even have to pay my bill since my service isn't working. At one time, I had internet & cable, but when I cut off the cable I received a higher bill, just for the internet. Usually, when people get put on hold with other companies, there's a soft music playing on the phone, but when they put you on hold, rock music is blasting in my ear, which is very disrespectful.
__label__0 I am having problems where Comcast is saying I'm ordering PORN when I am not at home. This month $116.00 worth of porn. This past Sunday they told me at 1:21pm, I ordered porn at $11.99 per movie. I was not at home at that time. I was at my mother's and my daughter was at her boyfriend's house. I told them there was no one home and they said they do not want to hear it. I have to pay it. I owe Comcast for this month $278.00. Last month I got a bill for $248.00. I called and they said they were taking off 6 porn movies that I was charged for for this bill. I was charged for Dec. 15, 16, 18, 24 (what everyone does after church), 29, Jan. 2, 9, 15, 16 and 18. I work in the afternoon and my sixteen year old daughter is at school when they are saying we are watching these movies.
__label__1 I signed up for a promotion around May 2011 for Xfinity's internet and my wife and I were so excited, only to find out that our internet was not working and we had to wait about 2 days later for the technician to come out and repair the modem. The technician arrived at noon on May 29, that was our anniversary. We were going to a family gathering but missed most of it because the technician was working on our modem for over 8 hours! It was late in the evening, half our day gone, and my wife and I didn't even get an explanation on why. Next, I got my first bill around late June for the amount of $283.89!! I glanced down; I had a past due balance! Naturally, I was upset and wanted to know what was going on! So I called the first agent, he was apologetic. It was an error on their part and I was receiving the wrong service. I was supposed to get 12 mbs but instead was getting 20 and I was charged $99.99 for installation! After he assured me that it was going to be taken care of, I requested them to send me a paper bill with the correction so I can pay my correct balance. No bill came and my service was cut off about a week later! Now, I was furious and called for the second time only to repeat everything I went through with the first customer agent. I asked about the notes that the prior agent left regarding our last conversation. The agent told me if I paid $26.99 today and that my credit will kick in this cycle but they needed immediate payment. So, I paid and we got the service again. No bill came yet, and I called so it doesn't seem like I'm getting the internet for free. Again, this agent explained that my credit will take care of the cycle due to reimbursement of over $100.00. I asked how much balance is due. He said for next month, I believe $59.99, not including taxes.

__label__1 My cable TV service went out on 8/10/11.  I called Comcast on 8/11/11.  I was told a service repair tech is needed to come to my home to fix the problem.  I was given an appointment on 8/13/11, between the hours of 3 to 5 pm.  I got a call on 8/12/11 and 2 calls on 8/13/11 saying the appointment was set.  And the service tech will be at my home for repairs between hours of 3 and 5 pm.  I waited on 8/13 and no repair tech came.  I called Comcast at 6pm, since they are never on time anyway.  I was told that I did not have an appointment time set up.  I asked why would I get 3 calls from Comcast if I did not have an appointment.  I asked if anything was on record from my call made on 8/11/11.I was told that they did get a call from me on 8/11/11.  An appointment was made, but no time was set for home repair visit.  Why would I call, make an appointment, and then Comcast not set up a time for the service rep to come to get my service up and working again?  Did they think I just wanted to shoot the breeze with them?  Why would Comcast call me 3 times before my appointment, and then not give the service repair rep my appointment time?  My mother now has to wait 6 days before someone comes to fix the cable TV service.  I see now why Comcast was rated the worst when it comes to customer service.
__label__0 My internet service went out on June 28. It came back on briefly June 29. I called and reported it on June 30. I have a home office and I was unable to work without internet. I was told that Comcast could not come out until July 2. Comcast came out, reviewed the wiring in my house, and said that the problem was up at the street at the pole. The technician told me that he would report the problem and someone would be out that afternoon to fix it. The next morning, July 3, I still had no service. I called and I was told that no one was scheduled to come out and that they couldn't come out until later that week. I paid the man to help me because I have a home office and couldn't work. He found someone to come out between 1pm and 5pm on July 3.I waited and called Comcast on 5/4/30 and was told that they would still be there by five o'clock. At 5:40pm, I called Comcast and I was told they couldn't get there until 6:45pm. I was very upset because July 3 was a holiday and my day off from work and I had spent it waiting for Comcast to show up. I asked them to come Saturday morning at 10am instead. Comcast came on July 4 and fixed the internet up at the street. I called Comcast today to complain about the service I had received. I was told that they would give me a credit of $10.71 for my loss of internet service for the week. I asked to speak to this person's manager.After being put on hold for 20 minutes, Christine ** came on the line. She told me that she could give me $10.71 of credit for internet service. When I said that was not enough for the pain and suffering, loss of income and various inconveniences of spending hours and hours of time on the phone, she said she would give me a credit of $27.99 for one of the service calls. I was shocked. I asked her if she meant that I had to pay for these service calls of Comcast coming out to fix their equipment. She said, yes, I had been charged for two service calls at $27.99 each and she was willing to give me a credit for one of them.When I insisted that was not adequate, she agreed to credit me for both service calls because it was Comcast equipment that was at fault. I lost a week's worth of work and hours of time dealing with Comcast. They made no effort to compensate me for my time, energy, and loss of income. They were unfriendly, uncooperative, and unwilling to offer decent, honest service. I believe they should have serviced their equipment immediately the day I called. And if they couldn't do it, they should have called me and let me know that they can't make it on time.
__label__1 Ok, so we have been having this problem with Comcast since we got our service about 3 months ago. They have charged us for 2 lines - we have only one. We PAID the installation and yet it keeps popping back up on the bill even after being told it would be taking care of. Now after having to call them again because the charges are STILL on the bill, my wife calls, talks to them - they ask to speak to me (bill in my name). They get my info, ask if I want her added to my account so that they can talk to her without having to bother me. I tell them no. Give her back the phone and then I am told they added her to the account even after I told them NO. Seems like there could be reason to look into a lawsuit on something like this. Adding people to your account against your will is against the law... I'm pretty sure of that...
__label__0 I have had more problems with comcast that I could possibly be able to share. One time it took them 4 service calls 12 technicians and over a month to hook up our cable box. They kept telling us that we would have to pay extra to hire a small technician to fit under our house. After all of this hassle, we ended up calling a company who came over and did it in about 20 minutes. Our cable is CONSTANTLY interrupted. I am not able to use satelite b/c we have too many trees.... How is this not a classic monopoly? The rates that they have advertised on their website are about $80 lower than what we pay, when i called to ask about this, they said that unfortunately my area wasn't involved in this deal and offered me another package that cost more. 
__label__1 Comcast charged me for the Mayweather-Pacquiao Fight that did not play. They claimed that shows up in their system as the event did play for 54 minutes, when in fact it did not. I have an SD box so I ordered it on the phone in Standard Definition and they charged me for HD. They said that in their system shows up as if I ordered from the box in HD. The fact is that I could not play the fight. When I try to call, the lines were super busy because apparently million of people were having the same issue. I've waited on the lines for approximately hour and a half and finally gave up and hang up. The charge did not show up in my account online, so I assumed I was not going to be charged with all that fuzz going on. And of course I forgot about it because believe it or not some people do have to work for a living and can not be on the phone all day and make our lives about Comcast.Of course a month later the $99 dollars show up on my account and when I called they said it was too late, that I should have call earlier. When I said that I call that same day, they said that I should have call the next day. I tried to explain that I can not make my life about them, but that did not help. I spoke to a guy in Spanish and he escalated the claim saying that by mistake the show was provided in HD and that couldn't be played it on a SD box. Of course a week later the charge was still on my account. When I called they said that my claim was denied by their credit department (Of course they did not bother notifying me). And the new representative told me that despite the fact it was in HD my box can play it anyway. Of course I'm technically savvy and I'm telling you the pay-per-view did not play in the 810 channel they claimed.Under pressure he gave me the option to discount $25 dollars that that's the only thing I'm ever going to get. And of course after having fought with 3 reps I was emotionally exhausted and finally gave up I took the $25 discount because it was not worth my emotional health and my time to keep fighting for $99 dollars. Of course by giving me those $25 dollars under cohesion they protect themselves from further claims I suppose. But regardless I feel this is a great injustice, especially after giving Comcast thousands upon thousands of dollars and they do not have any client consideration. And of course because they are a monopoly I can't cancel their service, because they are the only ISP in my area. So the multi-billion dollars company managed to get away and steel $99 dollars from my account.
__label__1 We just moved into our new apartment and, with a strong reluctance to order from Comcast, we had to anyway because of the monopoly of cable companies. It was either Comcast or Verizon DirecTV, and satellite dishes I despise. So we ordered three boxes and internet and chose the option to install ourselves for free to avoid the headache and aggravation of an appointment. After I installed all devices, I used to the internet to activate them to avoid again any further headache or aggravation from their customer service. Only two were activated and it instructed me to call customer service. After speaking to about 8 customer reps and 12 transfers to various departments, they informed us that there was an outstanding bill from about 4 years ago and only one box was allowed on our account. So they deactivated the other two boxes!!!!! We don't even know what they are talking about and it's so aggravating. If that's the case, why wasn't this disclosed in the very beginning?!!!!! Then we have to wait until the next day to speak with the department who handles this type of situation. I so wish I can cancel but they are the only cable provider in Frederick, MD!!!! I hate Comcast so much with a passion.
__label__0 A Comcast Sales Representative contacts our residence claiming that we can have the identical services that we have with AT&T. The promised service is not only identical, but significantly cheaper with Comcast.  We have been Bellsouth AT&T customers forever.  Our AT&T service consists of the amazing 'RingMaster' service that incorporates 3 phone lines into on with each line having a distinctive ring style.  Comcast promises to seamlessly connect us with them and also to save a huge amount.  Well we did it!  AT&T releases the phone lines, Comcast ports them over and a technician is sent out to our home to install a new Cable modem that will also supply the new phone lines.  WELL... after the tech installs the new modem, there's no dial tone on the phone lines. 5 hours later; this unexperienced tech had altered all phone line cables in the exterior box, and had no idea why the line was down.  When we call Comcast, we are learn that Comcast DOES NOT provide 'RingMaster' service AT ALL. They could only support up to 2 independent phone lines, as opposed to 1 phone line that supports 3 as it is with 'RingMaster'.  Well now it was too late, Comcast has the lines, and we have to revert to our service with AT&T.  But it's too late... Still we are without dial tone and our at home business is a dead halt.  The Comcast/AT&T conversion is promised to take up to 12 business days. I would like advice in what legal action I could take against Comcast for their FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. Thanks!This has caused our business to have no communication for 12 business days, and the possible loss of the phone numbers that were established with the RingMaster.
__label__1 I recently moved homes (both are within Folsom). I called Comcast to inquire about moving service to my new address. They quoted me $30 total installation charges. This call was recorded. They billed me $75. I called customer service and they said my only remedy is to go to a Comcast office and listen to the recording of the call. This should be their responsibility. I don't have the time to take off work, wait in line, and resolve their problem. Second, the phone service at my new address has never worked. I called during business hours, waited 28 minutes to get someone on the line and they would not send someone out to fix their installation problem unless I first took the time to troubleshoot the problem. I wasn't home (I was at my office) so was unable to. Again, they want me to fix their problem. They are currently charging me for phone service that doesn't work and installation charges not authorized.
__label__1 I was lied to, straight out. They quoted me a specific price for a package and specific stations on phone for more than 1 hour discussing monthly fee. On the same evening, the home channels discussed and ordered were not activated. The bill was approximately $20.00 more than quoted. Our conversation was recorded. How can I expose this? Some one help. I'm locked into 1 year contract at price much higher than agreed upon.
__label__1 I have a 2nd home in Florida which is a condominium and I am supposed to get cable TV through the association. I have picked up equipment for my unit and Comcast created a separate account. I have been trying to change my billing so that it is charged to the association, but I have been dropped by Comcast 3 times. The 1st time they transferred me, there was a recording that asked for my zip code. Not being a year around resident, I had to look it up. By the time I found my zip code, I was cut off. The 2nd time I was transferred, I accidentally hit the wrong key. There was no back button that I could use, so I was dropped again. The third time I got a hold of a representative, they hung up before I got my first sentence in. I spent an hour and 15 minutes, and nothing got accomplished.In these phone calls, Comcast had asked for my phone number and my last 4 of my SSN, so why do they have to ask for the zip code? Why do they cut you off, if you don't readily have your zip? Why did I have to wait so long to speak to a representative, only to have bad service? Why did they open a separate account when I told them that my association pays the cable? I'm extremely frustrated with this company.
__label__1 Over the last two weeks I have attempted to reach your collections department to assist me with setting up Internet Essentials and have a block removed from my residents because I did meet the requirements. I have been mishandled, misrouted, and experience unprofessional customer service over 13 times in the last 2 weeks in an attempt to resolve this matter. Your representatives have refused to allow me to speak with supervisors and I've handled myself in a very professional manner. However they still refuse to assist me in this matter.
__label__1 I was experiencing some technical difficulties with my on demand service in June. Technical support solution to this problem was to reset my box. After a couple of attempts they seemed to have the system up and running. The support rep asked me if I was able to access any movies. I said yes. He said "you're all set". This problem happened again in July. They redid the whole previous process again. Again telling me it's all set. In August my fiance called regarding an entirely different issue, went to automated system, told him his account balance was almost $500.00. We thought that had to be a mistake. After speaking with the billing dept we found out there was over 100 on-demand movies ordered in 1 month. I was really confused due to I had a lock on the service & a code would be needed to make any purchase. I did not give anyone this code. Apparently, when tech support reset my boxes it wiped out all of my parental settings. So, my 5 yr old son was able to order anything he wanted to watch. A little over 100 movies and episodes. I made 5 phone calls about this issue in the following 2 days. Comcast/Xfinity refused to remove the charges saying the movies and episodes were watched. The supervisor I requested to speak to never called me back. Finally I spoke to a rep that reviewed the account and got a supposed supervisor to approve a credit to my account due to our history not showing these sort of purchases before or any incidences like this. She went on to say she would need to split the credit into 2 due it exceeding her credit applying limit. She thanked me for being a loyal customer and we hung up. Well, after making a payment earlier this week I come home to find my service interrupted. It was too late to speak to anyone at 9:30 pm so I called the following afternoon. Only to find out after we hung up after that call in August, there was a so called review which lead to someone determining the credits would not to applied to my account due to the movies and episodes were all watch. Even though their technical support wiped out my parental settings and told me I was all set. I am so dissatisfied with this whole experience I am returning my equipment. I will never be a Comcast/Xfinity customer ever again.
__label__1 We do not have phone or internet service. I spent 6 hour contacting Comcast... To get help. They could not offer help until the next day. Our family cannot be without a way to contact 911 due to medical issues. They said they would fix the problem. I finally got a hold of them 4 hrs later to be told they said they could not fix it for 2 days now. So my family, whom has protocol for a certain medical emergency has to be without any way to contact medical services for 2 days. After asking them to tell me that was ok for my family... I was told "sorry for the inconvenience." They are horrible, ** service. The only good thing is the actual technicians are very nice. I have printed our chat so if something medical happens... I can contact an attorney.
__label__1 We left Comcast for another internet service provider. The big issue was not the internet service but, instead, issues with the administrative side of Comcast (difficulties with bill pay, the website, customer service, etc). I did not expect that the more serious problems would begin after ending the service.For the last three years, I have been billed for "equipment" that we did not have, because we already owned the necessary equipment and chose to use our own. After terminating the service, they began billing me for the equipment. Over the years, I spoke with many Comcast customer service people and collection agency reps. Each time, I ended the conversation believing that something had been resolved. In one of those conversations, I was asked about the equipment I had in my possession. I provided the manufacturer and model, and was told that Comcast had never carried that equipment. Finally, I thought, as usual, that the problem was resolved, but no. Inevitably, I would hear from another collection agency about payment for equipment.About three to four weeks ago, I was told, with sarcasm, that Comcast would run the serial numbers in their inventory to see if they had the equipment, and I would receive a letter as to the findings in 10 days. The customer service rep made no attempt to hide his belief that I was lying about having the equipment. I couldn't help wondering why it took three years for someone to even make the offer. I had little faith in their inventory, because the company had proved themselves to be incompetent, but my only other options were to pay for equipment I never had or file a lawsuit. I checked the mail today, and there was no communication from Comcast. I braced myself for yet another phone call from their customer service.The customer service rep checked the account and told me that they had received my equipment. I really had to hold back when I told him that they didn't receive anything from me, because I never had the equipment. Apparently, the equipment was found in their inventory. I wanted to know why I didn't receive a letter. I told him that, after all this time and being led to believe that the problem was resolved so many times, I wanted something in writing. He couldn't send a letter, so he called another department. The second department conveyed they could not issue a letter. Instead I would have to go down to an office to get a letter. That would be a half-hour drive (one way) for me and standing in line for an eternity, and honestly, I don't believe anything would come of it. I would lose at least half a day. Since the mistake was not mine and I have been put through hell over this, I believe they owe me something, and for God's sake, all I'm asking for is a letter. So, even after resolving an issue, the company is absolutely impossible to deal with. Fixing mistakes is almost completely in the hands of the customer. Now, I have to wonder how long it will take to get this off my credit record.
__label__1 No phones service for 4 days. No internet connection for 2 days. Nothing for 36 hours when power went out. What if I had to call 911? Suck suck suck. Comcast sucks. I can't believe this is what we have to work with in this country.
__label__1 On any given day, I would easily achieve speeds between 16.00/25.00. In the beginning, I rented Comcast's WiFi Router combo, but it was a P.O.S. as well, so I returned it and purchased a separate router & modem (I've read it's a preferred option); speeds seem to be far better than previously. However, as of last week, the same problem started once again. I've been experiencing slow to ridiculously slow internet speeds, mostly in the evenings and between the hours of 4PM - 8PM. Download speeds were between 0.44/1.08 & Upload unaffected, and steady between 4.00/5.00. The worst was last night. I purchased an HD movie from iTunes and usually it would begin 1-2 min. after purchase. This time, I was getting a message on screen advising a time movie would be ready to view, as it was "loading" and it jumped from 1 hr. 36 min to as high as 3 hours!. After 45 min., and a reset of modem, movie began to play. I stopped calling Comcast Customer Service. It's pointless since they always assume it's on the customer's end, and they do the usual system checks and ask you to turn off modem and restart. B.S., I tell you. I believe they are doing something to slow the speeds down during these times, but what can the consumer do? My only other option is AT&T, but only DSL is available, and why should I switch? If I'm paying for high speed service with Comcast, I should expect top speeds no matter what time of day it may be. Frustrating, I tell.
__label__1 The more Comcast proclaims to put the customer first the more hollow it is. We researched ISPs in our area and decided to go with Comcast. They tried their best to hook us into their bundled service which is such a good deal, for a year, then it becomes a new car payment forever. They couldn't activate it for over a week later and wouldn't give us a time window. The day came and went and no call, no email, no internet. Now we had to wait 3 more days. Again no time window. I know why they are so expensive. So they can run all those commercials trying to convince us that all of our experiences over the years of disappointments over appointments has change. Well headline: IT HASN'T.
__label__0 I had set my TiVo to record Globe Trekker, for the episode including Iran. Guess what happened? ONE HOUR OF BLACKED-OUT PROGRAMMING!GREAT IDEA, COMRAD-CAST!I was unable to watch the episode I was looking forward to viewing. Why should Comcast use their prehistoric political angles to keep me from watching a program that encourages viewers to get along with the rest of the world?! There has to be a legal precedent involved in this kind of instance.
__label__1 So I spoke with Comcast again today. Last week we had outages and this week we are starting out with more outages. In this digital age we are in dire need of reliable phone and internet services for our company which operates predominantly online, however in the past year I have been in charge of the account our business has had over 15 outages that have disrupted our business.Each outage or service disruption leaves our clients in a lurch because they cannot contact our business and in turn, business is lost. We are credited for the service for the day, but a measly $10 maximum credit is minuscule in comparison to the amount of business we have lost. My colleagues and I want to work with a business that has ethics, customer service, great products and reliability. Why is this so hard to find with an Internet and phone provider? Get your act together Comcast.
__label__0 I do not have service or account with Comcast. There's a service box in the right corner of my backyard.  This box is used to connect cable and phone service to the other three homes that is adjacent to me. I am a Dish network customer. I went out to look at what needed to be done to repair my gate on February 12, 2010.  While I was out, the meter reader for the gas and light was reading the meters. On February 13, 20010, the gate door was remove and repaired for the third time in 6 months and lock. On February 17, I was sitting at my desk and heard the gate swung open and close.  Somebody busted the gate open. The next day, I wired before the gate close. By Saturday, the gate was swinging open and closes again. My mother is their 24 hours a day. That Saturday, I ask my neighbor and mother, who entered the yard. They told me that Comcast was there three times that per week.I called Comcast about a repair and spoke to ** @ 9:4 am on the 1st of March.I called on the 4th and they said that will try to cancel our savings .  I called again on the 4th and they said that they will call in 48hrs. I called again on the 8th.  I called again on the 10th at 4:32pm and they gave the direct number to **, a claims representative. He never answers my calls.  On April 7, I spoke to ** but until now, I have not gotten a response about repairing my gate.One of the Comcast employees continues to enter my entrance gate to my backyard by force. My mother is home 24hrs.
__label__0 This problem all started when I received a bill for the month of March for over 200 dollars for cable for the month. I called up and asked why my bill jumped up so high, and they said that I rented a lot of movies that month. I wasnt aware that anyone at the house was renting anything, so I asked around and we didnt. I asked Comcast to look into it for me because Ive never heard of a cable bill being so high and because we didnt rent anything. We already pay for HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, and Stars, so we have all movie channels. Also, we have 2 cable boxes, one of which Comcast never activated and one that was broken (on-demand was down). Comcast thought it looked funny that one movie was rented 6 times in March. And we have it on DVD, so we know we didnt rent that. Anyhow, who rents a movie 6 times in one month? We do not have a bill this month. She confirmed and said she was going to send out to me a revised statement.About a week later, I received a bill from Comcast stating that I owe $206.11. Confused, I call back into Comcast and ask why I received this if my bill was waived. They have no record of me calling at first. Then, I ask to speak with a supervisor and there isnt one working there that day. After about an hour on the phone and long hold times, the woman comes back on the phone and tells me that the supervisor I spoke to last time added comments to the account but forgot to actually take off the $206.11. She confirms to me its no problem at all, and she said that she is going to go ahead and remove it again like the first person was supposed to do. I explained how long it took to get this settled last time as well as this time, and she confirmed to me she will be personally handling it and that it was removed. Once again, I ask for a written statement showing that they removed it be sent to me at my address on record. She agreed. I said, Thank you and we hung up.Another few days go by and I receive a letter in the mail saying that my account is overdue now (107 dollars) and I owe a total of 306 dollars. Outraged by another Comcast mistake, I call the phone number that I was given by the previous person helping me. The extension does not exist! Not even close to an extension Comcast uses, they said. So I start from scratch from the bottom again. Now, this is the third time I have called in on the same issue Comcast told me they are sorry about and have told me will be handled. Now, the bill is telling me that the bill is overdue and my service will be shut off if I do not pay immediately. I request time off at work and call into Comcast to once again start from scratch. This time, I ask for a supervisor right away. I talk to her for an hour, and she first told me she sees nothing on the account when I specifically asked the last person I spoke with to add comment to the account. I talk for an hour and get nowhere. She decides she is going to look into it and call me back later in the day. She calls me back at 7pm one night and tells me that she hasnt gotten anything on it and that shes still working on it. Meanwhile, Im not sure if I should pay my bill or not. She said to hold off and she would place a stop on the collections until the issue was resolved. She tells me that she will call me tomorrow when she finds out what happened. Next day, no call from the supervisor who said she would call me between 5 and 6pm. I get in to work in the morning and call Venessa and leave her a message asking whats going on and why she was not back in touch with me yesterday. I get a voice mail (doesnt even ring). Later on that day, I get back from lunch and I have a message from Venessa saying that they looked into it and have decided not to adjust the bill. I told her that it was already decided a few weeks ago by a field technician that it was impossible for our household to rent movies and that all on-demand movies were going to be removed. She said they will stick with the inconvenience fee, but I owe them 300 dollars still. I call back and again I get a voice mail right away. This is illegal and someone needs to monitor Comcasts Billing. There is no way anyone in my house rented any movies prior to the technician coming over to fix it. It was impossible and I have the documented receipt with his comments on it to prove it.
__label__0 A week ago a man stole a truck and was speeding through our neighborhood when that individual hit a power pole. Shortly after that incident, we began having cable internet issues. It was solely internet issues and not any other issues with the cable TV. I called and had a technician come out to our house and replace the modem and then he told me it was all fixed. He gave me his supervisor's number and his number. About an hour after he left, the same problem happened. It was going out again, so I called back and he came back over and was working on it again. He told me, once more, that everything was fine and he fixed it.This time, it worked for a little under 24 hours and started going out all over again, so I called Comcast back and this time asked to speak to a supervisor because they said it would be a few days later. The person on the line told me that the supervisor was on the other line and that she would call me back in a few minutes. I waited almost 2 hours and never received a call back. I called again and the person on the phone said the same thing again. Supervisors on the phone with a customer, and that my information would be passed on. It was late in the evening, but I waited and never got a call back. The internet went out again at around midnight and I did not come back on at all until 6:00 the next morning. But, then went back out at 6:30. I called Comcast again and spoke with a lady named Tron.She said there was nothing she could do, but she was at least helpful and transferred me to a local dispatch to see if they could do more to help. When this person answered, his name was Nick; I began to retell the problem for the 6th time. I also told him that they had already replaced my modem and that I already had a ticket out, I just wanted to have them escalate it since this was an ongoing problem from a previous visit. He proceeded to ask me if I wanted to start a new ticket since I was reporting a problem. I told him that I already had a ticket and was looking for a bit more information. I explained everything and his response was "what do you want me to do about it" and then told me that he reset my modem and everything was fine and that I probably didn't need someone to come out since it was working. After that, I was kind of irritated, but I know that the only way to get assistance is to keep my calm, so I did. I told him that it does this, it goes out, but then comes back on and will work for a bit, but will go out again. He told me that my problem was just my router, but the previous technician already ruled that out and I had ruled that out by connecting directly into the router and still seeing the problem. So, he said that maybe we just needed to replace the modem.I reminded him that I had already told him that the last time someone was here, they replaced it with a brand new one and it was showing the same problem as the previous one that had worked fine for a year without issue whatsoever. He continued to say that he couldn't have anyone come out any time soon and he wasn't looking to ask. I reminded him again, that this wasn't a new request, but an extension of the previous visit that was never fixed. I got a bit frustrated and asked why I was paying for a service I couldn't use. He said that wasn't his problem and if I needed that resolved, to talk to someone else in another department. This is one of the biggest issues. I asked him what was going to happen if I couldn't get the work done that I needed to do and what would happen about my wife and her online distance learning classes. He told me that I should just cross my fingers and hope that it doesn't go out while we're doing that. Flat out, he said I should just hope that my connection that I'm paying for works when it is needed. No need to rely on proper service at all. I asked to speak to his supervisor after that and he responded by asking me why. I just repeated that I wanted to speak to the supervisor and he again asked why. This went on for a minute or so. When he responded with "Oh, he's on the other line right now, do you want me to have him return your call later? I told him about the multiple previous times I'd heard that statement and never received a phone call and that I could wait to speak with him while on the phone discussing the issues. He then told me to tell him what my problem was and he would relay that to his boss and then he would tell his supervisor and his supervisor would be caught up on the problem right away and speak to me immediately. So, my response was "So, you lied about your supervisor being on the phone a moment ago?I asked to speak with him and you said that he was on the other line and said he would call me back, but now, immediately after that, you say that all I have to do is tell you why I want to speak with him and he'll be here right away? He paused for a bit, but then said yes. He said as long as I tell him what the problem is, that I could speak to the boss, so I finally said that my problem was the representative's attitude with which I was speaking.So, he told me that wasn't a valid reason to ask for a supervisor. I just repeated that I wanted to speak to the supervisor several times while he said I had no reason to do so. Again, I reminded him that if I told him the reason, he'd put on the supervisor. I held up my end and it was time for him to reciprocate. He put on his supervisor, but I sat on hold for 5 minutes. Chris was the supervisor's name. I asked him if he'd been briefed on everything and he said somewhat, so I allowed him to begin telling me the issues and what was being done. It was very clear very soon that he had no clue what was going on. So, I told him what his representative said to me and he told me that they'd deal with that in house and I shouldn't worry about it. So, I told him the rest of the problems I was having and he told me that I should just go somewhere else, like a library or a Star Bucks, to do the work that I needed and my wife should do the same.So, instead of staying home and doing what I can do from home, I should go somewhere else and do my work from another location while I pay for the service at home. I asked to speak to his supervisor when he said he didn't have one. Finally, he said that I could call the corporate line and gave me that number. I spoke to an assistant there and went over everything that I had issues with. She said that my complaints were valid and that the Regional Manager would be giving me a call in the day to get everything taken care of. I got a call at 4:45 PM from the Regional Director, but I was not able to get to the phone on time to answer it. I immediately called the number she left with me, but got a voice mail saying that if the call was after 5:00 then I'd have to wait until the next day to hear it.I called before 5:00 PM. It took 1 minute to listen to the message and write down the number and dial the number and call her back. It is currently the next day at 3:30 PM and I still have not heard back from that manager. The technicians came out and said that since the problem wasn't happening now, then I wasn't going to get much help from them. But, every time I call is when I'm having the problem and they have to schedule an appointment which means that I have to once again, hope and cross my fingers that everything will be fine while they aren't here, but then also hope and cross my fingers that it'll be out when they are here to get everything fixed. Work that has to be done cannot be done in the convenience of my house where I'm paying for internet service. This is my problem that I'm having with Comcast.
__label__0 I received email from COMCAST.   What hits me is that they are now setting limites on the amount of bandwidth usage allowed, which means they will start charging when the limits are set, because, they claim, less than 1% of their customers exceed the new limits.  I quote '... because a fraction of one percent of our customers use such a disproportionate amount of bandwidth every month that they may degrade the online experience of other customers.? This is pure PR speak.  So, for the sake of  a fraction of one percent?, they are going to set limits on 99% of the consumers! I can't believe that the fraction of one percent that are using excessive bandwidth are affecting this company's bottom line and I know that these 1% ers are not capable of and do NOT degrade the online experience.? If COMCAST's network servers are so fragile, then we have bigger problems than anyone was ever aware!   This fraction of one percent? is only a justification to set the consumer up for future additional usage charges that are sure to follow!
__label__1 We pay a lot of money to see our favorite HBO shows. So what happened to Curb on Demand? I look forward to that show in particular, and if I can't get it on demand, I want to know why!
__label__1 Comcast implemented data cap in my area, allocation of 300 GB for residential accounts. I was told by a rep, after reaching the data limit my account will be charge $10 for an addition 50Gb. This is outrageous. Unfortunately, they can force this on us because of a lack of competition.
__label__1 Been a customer since 2011 on automatic payment. My credit card expired. They cancel my service without a notification that after been a loyal customer until Sept 2015 am no longer on automatic payment. Looking for another provider that cares about their business and appreciate loyal customers. After talking to so many customer service agents both in Spanish and English and one manager in Spanish who was so unprofessional. His name Cristian ** and another customer service agent name Wayne. Waiting for supervisor to call they never did. Even Mr Tom Karinshak, Senior Vice President of Customer Experience get real. Your service is not free. We can take our money someplace else. Keep doing that - you will lose a lot customers.
__label__1 Comcast debt collectors have contacted me several times over the last 2 1/2 years for an account that was closed out in Jan, 2014 and that has had a zero balance. Each time they claim that I owe a different amount and each time Comcast confirms that nothing is owed. The recent debt collector confirmed that any money paid is forwarded to their offices. They are definitely in contact with Comcast and they use a Comcast internal email: cendiv_collectionagencyescalations@comcast.cable.com. These actions have the appearance of fraudulent efforts to extract money. They waste my time and are very annoying. Think about what your time is worth before selecting a provider.
__label__1 Super Bowl 50. Epic Showdown. Friends were invited and the beer and food were served. But no game. Comcast cable (the service required by my apartment) decided to crap out 4 times during the game. Each time the cable box (provided by comcast and assured to be the latest model) reset itself would take 10 minutes. We missed half the game. I have been used to bad service from this provider but this was the straw that broke the camel's back. Will forever on refuse to buy comcast and spread the word to anyone and everyone to never ever use them.
__label__0 Every month my bill has been wrong.  Then my service went down for a long time about a month.  They had credited me.  During the time my service was down they had 3 technicians come out and try to hook up the modem with no luck and left without any of my service working. Then a fourth supervisor tech came out with no luck.  Finally a month and a half later a guy at comcast fixed it on the phone.  We called comcast to ask what the bill would be with our credit.They said $87.00 we went in and paid.not to go back to the beginning but they were double billing me and admitted to it in 2007 for internet for 7 months.  So then we get a $400 bill saying our service was going to be shut off and there was nothing we could do because we were late since december which is not true.  Everyone I talk to is telling me the same thing but I know it is not true.  They make you feel helpless.  My wife would be the contact call her at the home number she can give you all the info.  Please help.  Mu bill should only be $165 to $175. It has never been right since we signed up with them. I want an attorney to contact me.The result is that I will be out almost $500 for no reason.  Please help
__label__1 I talked to a representative Feb 11th and asked her for Double Play (internet and TV). The rep started to tell me that they had great promotions. I told her my pay limits were up to $120 a month. She started saying that she was doing something special for me and that there was a plan with home security, telephone, internet and TV package and all in the price I was looking for; plus she said that she will waive installation fees, send me a $200 gist card and it was not a contract. At that point I said, "Wow what a great deal."The 19th of February the guys came in and installed the services and I they asked me to sign a contract, also my bill went from $119 to $185, then from $185 to $354 in just the first 2 weeks. That day my nightmare began. I called every single day since the 19th of February, people from customer services, customer solutions, billing all hung up on me and they did not care about anything at all. It was the worst experience ever. I tried, in every single call, explaining I got services I did not ask for and to listen to the call which has every single piece of the promises made by that sales rep that day (I gave them name, number, time of the call, length of the call). I had promises of managers and/or supervisors calling back and nothing ever happened. When day I called 10 times and the ten times I was hung up on. I never imagined Comcast was going to be so horrible. I returned all the equipment, no one cared.
__label__1 My husband and I had to get Comcast where we lived because Dish wasn't allowed. They told us our bill would be at minimum was $60 for two boxes, phone and internet at a fixed rate for 12 months. When they installed the cable, they couldn't figure out how to install cable in our sons two rooms. They had the cable line outside of the ground for all to trip over. The line went from our yard, in the neighbors yard and through their neighbors drive. The first bill was higher than we were told even for connection charges. As months went by, the bill kept getting higher and we never rented movies, nor did we go over on the computer. We never received a bill showing the amount owed, even after calling them to start sending to our address. Had to go by word of mouth. Our cable was constantly in and out, scrambled and unclear on regular days. We dropped them when we moved, refusing to pay their $400 bill. We still can't get our money back.
__label__1 They disconnected my cable and Internet, because they claim that a past balance from a year ago which is $542.00 was never paid, when I tried to explain to them that they must of had a computer error! Cause I never lived in that address, they didn't help me at all, instead they kept suggesting me to pay a bill that doesn't belong to me! So I went to their nearest office and spoke to an agent, and still got nowhere! 3 days later I tried calling again and the agent told me that my bill is only 77$ and that the reason they disconnected me was because they put in the notes as if I wanted to cancel services, which obviously was not me!So I paid the 77$ and right away my services was on. The next day I come home from work and once again my services is off!!! I call again and the agent tells me there's nothing him or the manager can do about turning on my services because I need to speak to loss prevention and they not available 'till the following day! He also said the reason for my disconnection once again is because that $542 balance popped up again!! At this point I feel like they are not caring for their customers! Not trying to fix the problem on their end! And now I have no services even though I pay my bill on time! I'm so disappointed.
__label__1 After being informed that Comcast is dropping analog cable service in my area, I researched my equipment options for receiving digital cable signals.  I have a media center PC that I use to receive the cable signal and allow for recording of programs.  I bought a Ceton InfiniTV 4-tuner card for the PC, and it requires a CableCARD to receive many of the channels that I'm paying for. Comcast's website clearly states that "The first CableCARD in a retail device is free to Comcast customers."  But my first bill after the digital changeover shows a charge of $8.50 a month for the CableCARD.  After four phone calls and more than an hour of frustrating of ** and being on hold, I finally was informed that Comcast recently started charging this fee if the customer also has a digital set-top box or digital converter which I picked up from their customer service outlet when I picked up the CableCARD.  It's called a "Digital Additional Outlet Service Fee".  But the real problem is that this fee is not documented anywhere which is exactly what Bertha, the customer service representative, told me!  I certainly couldn't find it anywhere on their website.  How is it legal to charge a fee if it is not written in any legal contract?I am returning the "free" and still unused digital converter box to eliminate the Digital Additional Outlet Service fee.  I only got the box as an emergency backup for when my media center PC failed for some reason but $8.50 a month for a TV insurance is insane.
__label__1 I switched from AT&T about 2 years ago and didn't know in advance that my analog landline was replaced by a digital one, which means that the new one will not work if electric power goes out. A major bummer here in quake-prone CA! Since then I've realized that a landline is almost useless, since we have cell phones, except for receiving lots of unwanted marketing calls. I use donotcall.gov a lot but this has not slowed down the unwanted calls. Comcast allows you to block 15-20 calls but this is not enough because marketers can easily use many different numbers.
__label__0 I am having trouble with my signal, all spotty now for over 24 hours. This happens all the time and I am getting sick of it. It always happens when I am counting on watching a program. I would like to have my bill compensated accordingly or I will go to another carrier and my family and friends feel the same way! I have had enough of this poor quality with my service.
__label__1 We were sent a new box to update our internet connection. We spent over 2 hours on the phone trying to get it to work. We spoke to 3 different people - two of whom were very difficult to understand. The other was a very grumpy woman. They never could get it to work and decided the modem is defective. Their solution to the problem was to say that we had to take the box to the Comcast store. The only way they would send a technician was if we paid for the visit and even then they said he would not bring a box, we would still have to get a new one ourselves. We are exploring our other options for Internet connection.
__label__0 About three months ago, I called Comcast customer service to change my bundle package for one that I search on the internet which is for 12 months. Customer agent offered me a free promotion of three months of show time, Cinemax and sport package free and a Latino package free for six months. Today, I called Comcast customer agent to remove the first free promotion of showtime, Cinemax and sport package. The customer agent said to me that my package will expire by next month and that the price was going to be higher. I said to her how could that be if I just picked a new package the same day the free promotions were offered to me. I asked her that I wanted to speak with a supervisor and she denied it to me and also argued with me that the same thing she was telling me it was the same thing that the supervisor was going to tell me. I asked about three times that I wanted to speak with a supervisor or someone higher than her and she would not let me to speak to anybody else but her. It is ridiculous how these companies offer packages to the customers they don't place it in the system and then the customers end up paying more and trying to take advantage of customer to get more profit base on the economy at this time of life. 
__label__1 I signed up for a week pass for Xfinity wifi for 19.99. I live in center city Philadelphia (where Comcast headquarters is located). This wifi service isn't even half as fast as the 3g data on my phone. And monthly, it costs about as much as a high speed internet service. The connection constantly drops out and I'm less than a mile from the Comcast building. I guess I'm just going to go back to using my phone plan's 3g data for its superior speed and reliability. I'm not one to normally write internet reviews but I'd like to join in on the effort to pile on Comcast. The fact that a company can provide such terrible services and be so successful is appalling.
__label__1 I called in to downgrade my service to Internet (from triple play) and was informed the monthly fee would still be $80. I ask why it would be so high when new customers could get Internet $45? The customer service rep on the other end of the phone told me that they couldn't get the level of Internet that I had for $45 yet there is a very clear ad for the very same Internet for $45 a month. They would not give me a cheaper rate so I canceled the service.Today I went to turn in the TV box and the modem. I was greeted at the door. I was given a ticket and asked to sit and wait. Five minutes later one of the representatives named Courtney called my name. He did not greet me when I got to the counter. He did not say anything. I handed him the ticket I had been given, which he took, processed, did whatever he had to do in the computer, handed me a receipt and I left. He did not say a word. Such good customer service, no wonder their reviews are so low!
__label__5 Two years have passed and I still have not received my netbook promised to me for signing up. First, it was "didn't pay bill on time." When that turned out to be false, it was "didn't sign a contract." Bad, bad people.
__label__0 For well over 3 years, my family and I enjoyed the benefits of having a home network system between just 2 computers, sitting side by side. File sharing across the network is one way we used our network. In our family, also, we enjoyed playing games with each other across the network. This, after all, seemed to be a safe way to allow our kids to enjoy the world of multiplayer gaming, but without the concerns of them interacting with strangers out on the web in gaming chat rooms.About 1 years ago, my wife enrolled in an online college program. She tried to manage with our mere telephone modem Internet access, but for all the obvious reasons (continuous disconnects, high internet traffic, etc.), it became necessary to get high-speed (HS) Internet access - something more reliable for her educational needs. With Comcast having recently dug up our street and installed the lines, and because they are the only TV cable company in our area, they seamed to be our only realistic option for HS Internet access.The Comcast installation technician was a gentleman, and was quite good, respectful, and new exactly what needed to be done. He installed one modem, then from that modem was attached our network hub. This gave both computers immediate Internet access. This was cool! After he left, and once our kids came home from school, we found, however, that we no longer could play games across the network. None of our file sharing or printer sharing capabilities existed anymore. We could go online and play multiplayer games just fine, individually, but not simultaneously. Though being a little PC hardware and software savvy ourselves, we still could not find a way to regain our home network capabilities.In frustration, and after a week of doing research, I learned something very disturbing - Comcast software, used for their HS Internet modems, automatically disables/sabotages home networks where they are installed; for another monthly fee, Comcast will come back (another day of work lost for me) and install their router that will enable my home network to work again, which, if you recall, worked just fine before they messed it up. Now remember, their technician installed one modem, connected our hub to it, and gave Internet access to both home PCs. No one said that our home network gaming and file sharing days were going to be over, UNLESS we paid them a monthly fee to fix something THEY disabled.OK, we may not be techno junkies, but were not entirely ignorant either. We went out to our local Radio Shack and bought a router. Problem solved. We got our network back, without loosing our Internet, and without being blackmailed into paying Comcast to fix something they  messed up. I really feel that Comcast was not forthcoming in explaining to this customer just how their HS Internet access was going to affect our existing home network. And, Comcast would not make right the problem that their hardware/software caused. Comcasts only solution was for them to come out, again, and install a router. And then, if that wasnt enough, they wanted to charge us $4.99/month/computer in our home that was on that network.
__label__5 For answers, they read off of a computer screen and have no idea what they are saying. X1 box is very slow. Cable and internet is way too expensive for what they provide. DVR doesn't work at times, can't delete programs. I hate Comcast, Xfinity, whatever they call themselves. Rates are constantly going up for no reason, programming sucks, DVR should be a lot faster than it is. Even Comcast says that it is VERY slow!!!
__label__1 Let's face it... we all know that cable companies are an oligopoly in the US and they should all be at least fined or at most be in prison for their business practices. Bottom line: they sneak charges on your bill. We have the HD Complete XF Bundle with the X1 DVR system. With this system, we have the X1 master DVR in the living room and are allowed up to 3 additional HD outlets for free. We have 4 additional outlets in our home and should thus be charged for one additional outlet per month. Well, this month, our bill seemed much higher than usual and lo and behold, out of the blue, they started charging us for 4 additional boxes at $9.95 each. I have been live chatting with them for over an hour and the woman who is likely in India or Pakistan keeps telling me that the extra charges are for my X1 system. She cannot resolve the fact that this is a NEW CHARGE on our bill this month.Prior to this problem, we went for 4 months without functioning DVR service. We were on the phone with Comcast weekly and they kept telling us that the problem would be resolved within 24 hours. Finally, we had to pay to have a technician come out to our home. He said that they had given us equipment that should have been sent back for repair. So, the previous guy had taken faulty equipment from another person's house and gave it to us. Isn't that lovely? Here's the best part: guess how much they refunded our account for having their crappy malfunctioning equipment for 4 months? Have you guessed?$7. Mind you...this is not even a $7 discount per month. It was a total of $7. After screaming and fussing on the phone, I decided that my blood pressure and sanity were more important because I was getting nowhere with them! They argued that they provided the services as they had promised but that we were unable to take advantage because of the faulty equipment. I am not kidding here. But we only had faulty equipment because one of their technicians gave it to us!So, what am I going to do about this? Absolutely nothing. But why you must surely be asking yourself, would I not do anything!?! As stated in the introduction, we have no other options. The cable companies represent a legal monopoly. Last I checked, the US was still a free market environment but yet the gov't is allowing this oligopoly to continue. If y'all want to band together and rise up, I will stand with you. In the meantime, I will spend the next hour or so on hold with India because they have still not resolved my issue over the past 20 minutes it took me to draft this review.
__label__1 I moved to a new apt and - even though I have FIOS -- Xfinity pop up asking me to sign up. Continues to pop up and pop up. I clicked on the "manage my preferences" click and opted out. But Nooooo. A day later, there it is. Same laptop, same email address. I called and called and got an alternate # to call. After hold for 20 minutes, it hung up on me. What can I do?
__label__1 This company has gone completely downhill. My wife and I sat on hold a total of 18 hours the past three days. Got transferred over twenty times and disconnected over and over again. We cancelled our TV service due to an issue they could not resolve even after sending a technician out. Two weeks later, our phones stopped working. Got that resolved with 6.5 hrs. on the phone with them. This morning our phone and internet stopped working. My wife was on the phone with them all day to resolve the issue. They had someone else's social security numbers tied to our account and changed our phone numbers without our consent. They are completely worthless in my opinion and have a monopoly on the internet market. They do not care about their customers or value our time.
__label__1 Comcast is not to be trusted. They're nice when you sign up but once that promotion end, your bill sky high - all kind of hidden charges appear. Customer service rep rude and very unprofessional... Contact CEO Brian Roberts, nothing was done... ** Comcast, I will be contacting my lawyer asap...
__label__1 I was told on April 10th that a credit would be applied to my account and my service would be changed so I would benefit from the promotions again, because my account services were changed and my bill was higher than what I was quoted. I was previously given a promotion, but because of the misrepresentation of the cost, I would be able to get the promotions put back on my account. The old were soon to end, so the changes to the services weren't going to be made right away. However, after going through several people and the corporate office, there weren't any notes explaining why I was going to be given the credits. Several representatives saw the credits but said there was no explanation, so they transferred me back and forth between Billing and the resolution department.I got tired and called corporate, not to mention that a couple of the representatives were rude, not everyone. But when I spoke with the corporate office, she said she only saw where I said I was to receive the credits but it wasn't noted. I realize they are a company that doesn't care about integrity. Even though they express customer satisfaction, it's just talk. The only reason I put up with them as long as I have is because, in the area I live in, there was nothing else available. I'm glad to be moving, and I will make certain it's an area that offers something other than Comcast. I saw the donations they have made, I think we helped to make that possible. They shouldn't get all the credit. I know I've paid much more than I should have for their service. I hear other people on the job complain about the problems they have with Comcast, and I will complain to Consumer Affairs, and hope others that have problems complain. They need to be stopped.
__label__1 I used Comcast for approximately 4 years prior to ATT Uverse. Each customer service rep I had to speak with although seemed ethical, never was. I called to check their promos and was given what I thought was a great price for all three services, and for about 3 months my bill stated exactly what I was quoted. On the 4th month and every month thereafter the bill increased. I was never advised by my Comcast rep that there would be an increase in one year, but why would he if the plan for good for one year? Every month after that I had problems with my bill, always increasing.I finally had enough and after calling Comcast Customer Service and being transferred to three (3) different rep's I finally got a supervisor who after 2 hours on the phone with him had the audacity to tell me that the Comcast rep I originally had when I signed up with Comcast, didn't have the authority to offer me the original promotional price he offered. Well if the customer rep that answers the phone gives me a price should I ask for his credentials or his actual job description? Finally, I contacted ATT Uverse, who initially gave me a promotional price which has finally expired, but even then, UVerse didn't lie to me and kept track of any conversations or offers they gave me. I finally cancelled my service with Comcast and have been with UVerse ever since. I wouldn't go back to Comcast if my life depended on it. They are the worse, lying company I've ever done business with.
__label__0 Comcast called and asked if we would like to save money by having all services - cable, Internet and phone - on one bill. They promised a bill of $19.99 per month for phone, but charged lots of extra fees - $5.40 for having a non-published number and $5.00 for phone equipment plus lots of taxes and other fees.I tried to get the phone equipment charge and non-published number charge but they refused to do so. If their service doesn't work without a box, like other services did, then they shouldn't be allowed to charge for this. They also would not tell how much the box really costs, and don't have an option to buy one instead of paying a monthly charge for it for Infinity. Also, it doesn't cost any money to not publish a phone number, so charging a consumer for not publishing a phone number is outright highway robbery. I am looking for an attorney to sue this company, but heard that people aren't allowed to sue Comcast anymore.
__label__1 Lately, in the morning hours we do not have access to NBC, ABC and CBS. But, we can get CNN, TWC, etc. What's up with that?
__label__1 By far the worst customer service I have ever had. I had a problem with my modem so I called tech support. They came to the conclusion that it needed to be switched out because it was faulty. So we set an appt for the next day at 10:30 to 12:30. We waited and waited and no one ever showed up. I called at 1:00 p.m. and to see what happened and the gentlemen told me that the tech that was supposed to come never did because of a scheduling issue. They didn't even bother to call me to tell me this. I was then disconnected from him when he tried to get me to his supervisor. I was then on the phone from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. talking to different call center employees and when each one tried to connect me to a supervisor they kept disconnecting me and or telling me there was absolutely nothing they could do for me. I was extremely patient up until the very last person I talked to who happened to be a supervisor, because at that point he told me that it was too late and all the technicians were busy, but we could reschedule. Time and time again I told him that I could not reschedule because of work. Long story short, I lost 4 hours at work because of dealing with Comcast. That is money I will not be able to earn back, also I lost work at home that I do on the internet because they didn't fix my modem on the time they said they would. Comcast if you want to make this right, you better contact me ASAP. You cannot set a business appt and not show up for it, and then tell your customer that there is nothing you can do for them when they pay you. If you want to keep my business, you will fix the equipment that I am renting from you, that I am paying you for....
__label__0 My internet service went out so we called Comcast. They were not able to get it back up from their office and sent a service tech.  He found the modem was bad and replaced it.  I just got my monthly bill and found I was charged a $32.99 service call fee. I was not told before the tech was sent out that there would be a charge if the modem was replaced nor did the tech tell me. I was told this is standard and they charge a fee if the modem is replaced.  To avoid paying the service call fee you either have to take the modem to Comcast or pay a monthly $3.00 protection plan fee.   Yes, that's right, pay Comcast $3.00 per month to avoid a service charge if the equipment you are renting from Comcast goes bad.
__label__1 Them me start off by saying Comcast is a damn joke...my girlfriend and I just moved in to a house with our kids and was looking to get Comcast so we call and set everything up last wed and they said they will be out Nov 6 to hook everything up from the hours 11am to 1pm. So the 6th comes and no one comes or calls...so my girl calls Comcast to see why no one comes or calls and they ask for the account number and we gave it to them and they can't find an account with her name on it. If we didn't have an account then why in the world did the man on the Comcast line give us one. I really don't understand how can Comcast be SO DUMB. It's really unfair how they can tell you all lies but if you don't pay your bill they will shut you right off...so please anyone thinking about getting Comcast then think again...and the crazy thing is I went on this website and was reading all this, about how bad Comcast was and didn't listing now look I'm still with no cable.
__label__1 My Internet just happens to stop working right when I get home every night between 9pm -10pm. I pay $80 every month for really poor service. Moreover when I am home and have an Internet problem and call I am given another number that I need to call during business hours. I am not home during business hours to go through the diagnosis. Either Comcast needs to provide the service they are charging me for or refund me the money so I can switch to a better provider.
__label__0 I agreed to buy Comcast Triple Play from an "authorized" Comcast retailer on the internet. First, the triple play was supposed to come with a $200 Amazon gift card. It changed to $250 in "Saveology" dollars which actually means nothing. It is a scam, plain and simple. Then, after many calls and holding many times, I get to Comcast in Dover, DE for actually finalizing the deal and they want my social security number and aren't familiar with the deal I supposedly have and there are extra charges for every little thing. Then, they can't make an appointment of installation when we will be there in a few days. They even made an appointment and then canceled it just before I canceled the order. 
__label__1 I have had numerous issues with Comcast service and billing since I started my service in November 2012. My most recent issue is a $10 charge for Cinemax. I used their online chat to get the charge removed from my bill. The customer service person said that I would have to pay the $10 now and wait until my next bill for an adjustment. I know that this is wrong because I have had to have my bill adjusted before. I wasted my time talking to someone who was not helpful and had to spend extra time to call in. I also noticed that they started charging me for a box that was originally part of my package. I don't know how they can just remove something from my package and start charging me for it without any type of notification.
__label__0 I have a problem with both cable and internet service (going on Monday from semi-service to non-service at all on Wednesday) I call on Wednesday, they send someone on Friday. Technician says there's nothing he can do, it's a wiring problem, they will send people to fix it on next Wednesday and everything will work as usual. On Wednesday, I call for a refund being sure the problem will be resolved. Customer service representative cannot help me in any sense. I ask for the supervisor, supervisor Kenya Boughs, or something alike, was not understanding, called me a lier, and could not resolve a thing. People came, though, I expected to have service, these people said they will check on my connection. Never came. I call again Comcast to schedule (AGAIN) an appointment, they gave one today on Friday at 11:00.I had to work but I delayed my duties in order to wait for the technician. He did not came at 11:00. I called customer service. They told me they will came sometime between now and 6 pm. I recalled him that my appointment was at 11:00, he said he will call me back to update the status. So far, no telephone call at all.  Calling customer service is painful: nobody can resolve any problem, have more than 20 to 40 minutes listening to music and at the end, there is no resolution at all. I belong to a french and a hispanic community and believe me,I will not just cancel my account but also I will start a campaign to persuade all my friends and acquaintances to drop their accounts with Comcast based on my bad experience not just with the service but especially with representatives. Frustration. Work days delayed.
__label__1 Spoke to a customer service rep 2 days ago and set up service for today 05/28/16 between 1pm and 5pm. Waited for service or at least a phone call till 4:20pm when I finally called into Comcast to ask about service man's whereabouts. Spoke with a young lady and she stated technician came to my home at 1:38pm. Huh? He knocked on door and then called me. Again huh? Roommate, dog and I never heard doorbell ring and I never got a call from technician. My dog was roaming free in yard and would have barked at anyone she didn't know on my property. Let alone a Comcast van pulling into my fenced driveway out in rural Golden Gate!!! It had just quit drizzling rain so maybe the tech didn't want to work?Lovely woman on phone then stated that unknown ghostly service man notated that I had to have a new cable line run because box was 250 feet away? Huh? I live in a rural area however I had service with Comcast in 2014. Lines were previously run and my home is 125 feet off the center crown of the asphalt road and MAIN telephone pole they run service off of is approximately 150 feet from cable box on west side of home. HOWEVER my neighbor currently has Comcast and there is a telephone pole between our 2 homes and Comcast previously ran cable and internet off THAT telephone pole which is approximately 35 to 40 feet away from my cable box.I get the impression the technician did not want to work late today and choose to falsify his paperwork on this potential installation. I asked when they would send someone else and of course since it is 5 pm on Saturday and Monday is Memorial Day it would be Tuesday between 8am and 8pm?? Wow! What horrendous customer service. I can honestly see now why I dumped their service 2 years ago. Technicians that don't show up then lie about it and then I'm going to potentially be charged for adding new lines when lines are already there or can be run off neighbors and my existing pole and box??? I'm very disappointed to have waited all afternoon for nothing. And it appears Comcast doesn't give a damn about my time waiting. And then to find out they are going to probably try and charge me for a quote "250+" foot line installation is bogus!!! WOW! How is Comcast still in business?
__label__1 I moved in my house August 1st. I had a scheduled appointment for service in my home for 1 or 2 days after my move in date. Appointment was for 3pm. My fiancee got home at 3:10pm and the Comcast tech was sitting outside in his truck. So my fiancee walks over and asked him if he was here for my home and he just shook his head, said no and pulled the window up in her face. So she called Comcast and asked if anyone was coming over to put service in the house that day. They said yeah the tech was there but nobody was home and my fiancee told Comcast that there's a Comcast tech outside and he said he wasn't here for the house so she said oh yeah. He put his paperwork through that nobody was home and then said but regardless of what he should've still provided service if he knew that you hit home. But anyways we got scheduled another day that was like 4 day later. A different tech came out and service home. He did whatever it is he had to do. So he was getting ready to hook the TV on with the box after he finished running all the cable wire. He plugged the cable wire into the cable box and got shocked (red flag something is wrong). Anyways he proceeded, he went and got the hdmi cable and plugged it into the cable box. Then as soon as he plugged in the hdmi to my TV my TV caught fire through the hdmi cable I believe and had me sparks. Now my TV does not work and also my DVD player that was plugged into the TV does not work. So he gathers his stuff, calls Comcast and make a report. 1hr later Maby, his supervisor, came to my house to check up on what happened and went on saying how he apologize for what happened and said that the tech told him sleuthing was wrong with the house. That it was not grounded. And then went on saying how their tech army electricians that they wouldn't have I known if it was grounded or not. So I told him, "don't you guys give them training on that or you just tell your techs hey listen ummm if you are putting in service in a home and you almost get your face blow off then that means the house has a problem." But anyhow he went on saying that we should be getting a call that same day nowhere than the next and since their box is what caused all this to happen then they are going to reimburse us for our stuff. 2 days went on and we received no call. So we called and they said we should be getting a call in 6 to 7 days. 6-7 days later no call. We called again and they said we should be getting a call in 24 hours. I let 2 more days pass and no call. So 2 days after that I called again and this time they told me that they don't know why they told me that I would get a call in 6 to 7 days because it takes 30 days. So I got mad and requested a manager. Manager was more cool about things and felt bad about everything I went through and said I should get a call in a day or 2 and if I didn't that I should call back and they would send my report to corporate. So 2 days pass and I get no call. So I call back and it got send to corporate. Next day I get a call from Cable Net and they went on saying that they are not responsible for our stuff because the issue was with the house. We tried explaining to him what happened and he said that his tech told him a different story from what we are saying and that what we are saying isn't in the report. So I said no what I'm telling you is the truth because I saw with my eyes what happened and if report says different then obviously it's just going have down what the tech reported which I'm 100% sure was to back himself up. So now we are going on about close to a month with no service or TV and now after all the ** they put us through they're going to finally call us back just to say they are not responsible for our stuff after everyone else we spoke to from Comcast told us they are going to replace our stuff. So he said he was going call somebody and they was going to contact us back. So now I'm just waiting for a call that I'm sure is not going to come. And I thought to myself first of all I called Comcast to put service in my home, not Cable Net which is a private contractor that help do service for Comcast so I don't know why they made them call me. So I don't know who's paying for my damages but Comcast is going have to do something because did they hired Cable Net to put service in my home that's a issue between them but somebody needs to pay for my stuff. So now I'm just here thinking what else can I possibly do to get this take care off. Is legal actions really my only option? All I want is my TV fixed or replaced and my DVD player, and also some service at a discount for all the ** they put me through. Wish somebody could help me out!!!!
__label__1 I ordered service back in January. At the time I ordered it they told me that I only pay $39 for installation. I had installation guy came in and installed the product. Next month I got bill with installation fee of $39 which I agreed on and paid and next month I got another bill with another charge of $39. I was going back and forth with Comcast on phone. Just called them today and they give me good story that installation fee its only to call installation guy in just to come and look at you at your house! In order for him to install the product you need to pay additional money! THIS COMPANY IS VERY TRICKY AND WILL TRY TO RIP YOU OFF OUT OF NOWHERE. DON'T USE THEM. IT'S A BIG MISTAKE THAT I DID. INTERNET SERVICE HAS LOTS OF OUTAGE AND IT'S NOT STABLE! Waste of money!
__label__0 There is not a week that goes by that using Comcast for internet connection is so slow that you cannot use it or you do not wish to spend all day trying to download something. There Cable TV is not much better. I have had satelite TV where rain distorts the picture and Comcast has the same thing or the service will go out for no reason with no explanation of why when it comes back on.I use the internet in my business and I can't afford the slow speed's that Comcast provides.
__label__1 I have had Comcast scam me numerous times. This time I took a month to month plan because I knew I would not have long enough for contract to took month to month plan. Two months later the bill was incorrect and called to fix, they advised taken care of. When I cancelled account I received a bill for early termination fee. I have called times and spent 45 min or more each time to be told it's taken care of and then today I get a call from a collection agency trying to collect the same amount again. Called Comcast again and they say they never said that. I know calls are recorded and I need help resolving this and Comcast runs all over consumers.
__label__1 Ordered new service on 7/21/2011 and for some reason they wanted me to come into a service center to see my license.  I've had service with them for years at my prior address, and my credit is perfect.  She gave me an option to call a toll-free number so they could verify information over the phone.  I called; the gentleman took my driver's license number, and told me everything was complete.  I asked if I still need to go to a service center and he said, no.  On 7/25/2011, I received a confirmation call for the installation on 7/26/2011 between 12 - 2 PM.  That time passed; so, I called and they told me they would contact the installation team and call me.  Well, at 5:30 no call; so I called again.  This time the person tells me that I need to go to a service center so they can verify my driver's license.  Needless to say, I'm more than furious!  I've wasted the entire day waiting for someone to arrive.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and she tells me she has to leave them a message to call me back.  We'll see if that ever happens.
__label__0 I am a professional photographer. I usually have to download and upload photos for clients in a timely manner. For past 2 to 3 months, I have been having internet connection issue. My internet gets disconnected; therefore, my business phone gets disconnected since it is running over the internet (Vonage). The tech from Comcast came to my place and tried to troubleshoot this issue. Every time they came, they reset the router and it worked but the next day I had same issue. Last week, one more tech came and I said that I have issue with my wireless router so he suggested to me to get router from Comcast which I did. I still have issue with my internet connection. Yesterday and today, I called again but still it's the same issue. I am paying for this service but it never works as expected. This issue has impacted my business greatly. I am not able to deliver photos to my client on time which is having a bad impression on my clients. Moreover, I am not able to answer customer calls since my phone is not working along with my internet. Since my phone does not work, I have to use my personal cell phone which is costing me money every time I call them and be on the line for at least 15 to 20 minutes. 
__label__1 The worst. THE WORST. I could tell you of a dozen times I spent 3+ hours on the phone just to report an outage. This last one round of phone wars went TEN HOURS, because everyone wanted to argue that I wasn't experiencing the outage that I was indeed experiencing. I tried to cancel service and they phone tagged me around for another FOUR hours. Do they think this time isn't valuable to us? I harassed AT&T until they finally agreed to put a line down our street. I gave up on trying to reach someone on the phone and took my router in and had my service disconnected. The guy at the store said my router, that was given to me by Comcast only a year ago, was super outdated and my internet was going at about half the speed. He said I should have been sent a different one two years ago. He also said my plan was grossly overpriced and they had newer, cheaper plans. WAY TO NAIL THAT COFFIN SHUT.
__label__1 Some friends of mine who are and older couple just moved and decided to order new Comcast service. They asked me to be there the day of the Comcast install because I work in the computer/internet business myself and they wanted me to make sure the computers were connected and working properly on the internet and that their TV service was working properly. They figured a "second set of eyes" would also be helpful to assure that the Comcast technician did things correctly, because I told them a few horror stories about awful Comcast installs I had witnessed in the recent past.The technician was scheduled to arrive between 1 and 3 PM. I arrived around 1:30 PM that day (Nov 7th, 2014). We waited and waited...no Comcast guy by 3PM. We called, they said dispatch said he would be about 30 minutes late...3:30 then 4:00 then 4:30 PM..still no show. We called again, took the customer service guy 20 minutes to try and reach dispatch and the technician. Finally he told us that they could reach the original technician scheduled on the job, but that they transferred it to another technician who was on his way and he would be there before 7:00 PM (on a Friday evening). We said okay,..and...and..wait, wait....wait...wait...NO SHOW. Comcast sucks. Period.
__label__1 Starting with our bill for February, we noticed over a dozen movies that Comcast claimed we had watched. Most of the movies were pure trash and we would never watch that filth. Calls to Comcast billing got us nowhere as they insisted we had watched all those movies. A visit to the local Comcast office did finally get something done as the rep we spoke with said she would get the movies removed from our bill and also we were provided a PIN number to ensure that no one could watch movies on our account. Guess what? On our March bill 8, more movies had been watched despite having this PIN number to stop that. More calls to the billing department and then passed onto the Tech department. We were told that YES you did watch these movies on your second line and Comcast has the times and dates. The second line is in our guest bedroom which doubles as our home office. The television in that room is only 13 inches while the Main television in our home is in our living room and is 70 inches. What in God's name would we watch movies in an office on a small screen when we have this large television? Did the Comcast rep have an answer? Of course not; he even suggested that someone in the house might have watched these movies without telling anyone. Since it's only my wife and myself and I have out of the country since January that would have been impossible. This rep had the nerve to say that he and his fellow techs had never heard of such a problem and that we must be lying and trying to get out of paying for the movies. That did it. I told this clown that to accuse somebody of lying was beyond the pale and I was filing a formal complaint with the FCC. He quickly changed his tune and insisted that he was not saying we're lying, only that nobody had complained about this happening to them. I told him transfer me back to the department handling cancellations. Finally somebody there realized that I was entitled to these charges being taken off but it would need approval. With that I told her to cancel my entire Comcast service. Without a doubt, Comcast justly deserves the title of worst company in America.
__label__1 We requested Business Internet service installation, in a building that already has Comcast internet brought into the building, and installed in other suites. We requested it on 12/16. They still have not installed it, and did not show on 2 scheduled dates. Had to reschedule for next week, a full month after requisition for installation. ** service ever. Sheer incompetence and inefficiency.
__label__1 They are a pack of liars. I am dealing with them. Now I have NEVER been turned into a collection agency until I got involved with this ripoff company. First I shut down my service at old address I was told by user ID B.V. and rep named RANI my bill from the old address was 13.31 which I paid on the spot. Well I moved here and it was a mess. That moving thing they have is a joke.. First off they canceled the appointment to install a DVR and wiring (the system for some reason they could never figure out why). REALLY. Then I called cause I had nothing here and it was all suppose to be ready. YEAH RIGHT. I moved in Nov 2, '13 and canceled them Nov 11, '13. I had a big mess and nothing here and then I called after I got a bill and said hey wait I had nothing here from Nov 2, '13 till I canceled you on Nov 11, '13. The lady I talked to said she sees that and would turn the bill over to billing and would probably come out even. She stated she would call me back. I said ok. Well yesterday a collection agency called and said I owed COMCAST 71 dollars and change FROM THE OLD ADDRESS. ARE YOU KIDDING. I go online and print out my old address bill dated 12/1/13 and it shows 0.00 amount due today. The agency called again. This is total crap because it was such a mess up here and they could not collect on me here cause so many people know how bad it was including a friend that works for another company. They are trying to get me to pay for the old address. I hung up on the guy today and will continue to do so. They can shove that 71 and change up where the sun don't shine. I am done with that pack of lying trash. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST. They will rip you in any way they can even if they have to lie and they do that on a normal basis. They are a garbage company. Review all the complaints. Even at the BBB they have complaints which is where I am going next. I am going to go to every site on this computer that has an area for COMCAST for complaints.. People should KNOW.
__label__1 My internet service went out on 08/04/11. I called Comcast at 8:00AM on 08/06/11. I was informed that a technician would call me within 4 hours.  No one called. I called back and spoke to another analyst who assured me the exact same thing.  Again, nothing. I called Sunday morning, August 7 and spoke to an individual who said that a ticket was never even created and she created one. She said the technician would be at my house between 7-9am. Suprisingly, no one showed up.  I am still without anyone at Comcast to resolve my issue despite being on the phone with them for hours today.
__label__5 I ran late on my payment and Comcast cut my services off (cable, net, DVR, phone). The oddly high 'service restart' fee bothered me. The state exacerbated when I accessed the DVR, to find about 78%, of carefully selected digital data completely vanished. (Ouch!) Furthermore, the confused machine records scheduled data in a gruesomely desultory manner. Nothing stored-on is playable; instead, a random code gently recommends me to call Comcast.(Ouch! ) Consequently, the DVR HDD assumed an utterly decorative function. For the amount they charge each month, non of this should have happened. Since the competitors are not a better option (currently), the downstairs fellows are in juice-squeezer-vice-grip. 
__label__1 This company is the worst company ever. I wasted 7 weeks of my time to get service. The right hand doesn't know the left hand. I was told we can have service. We had service before and now I'm being told after 7 weeks and 7 days of lost pay from work told can't service our home. A tech came out, said line too far from box, need third party to come out. Schedule as he told me and then still no one came out after three calls and rescheduling of which someone was going to be coming out next Tuesday. I called them because I got confirmation and the fees were 110.00 more. Called 4 times. Last contact, was told order was cancelled. This company SUCKS with a capital S and I can't believe they are still in business even to the point we got a call them wanting us to tv too. How can a company run like this and service? They have no clue customer have rights, shouldn't of been lied to and they shouldn't of wasted my time for 7 weeks.I was told they kept putting orders in and canceling because they get paid by each order. They should pay me for 7 weeks of wasted time and I mean hours and hours on the phone. I will be sure to tell everyone of this company even to supervisor not knowing a clue how to read notes. Also they had open several accounts on our home.
__label__1 We built a new home and started the process of trying to get service run from the utility pole to the house. We started this process on 9/20 and each time we called, we were transferred to Boston because we have a 603 cell phone exchange. Our new home is in Florida. We finally had to go into a local office a town away, to get service. We were told we would hear from someone in 72 hours, which never happened. Called again, transferred to Boston, back to Florida, then disconnected. After several attempts I started using the chat feature on Comcast website. I just finished my third chat in 10 days. Each time I chatted the rep gave me a ticket number and said it would be resolved in 72 hours. Of course that never happened so I chatted after the deadline. Today is 10/3 and we are moving in our home tomorrow. Still no Comcast service, and this last representative actually gave me a date/time of 10/8 and said someone would come out to the new location. My husband and I believe this will be a technician setting up service in the house, and not be able to run the service line from the utility pole to the house, so we won't get service on 10/8 but at least we will have a representative at our new home and hopefully they will be able to coordinate someone coming up to run the service line. Should NOT be this difficult to get service for a newly constructed home.
__label__1 I filed a damage complaint due to the box and the television set blew out. I filed this complaint on 11/30/2011 and has yet to be resolved. They are supposed to call and give you updates. They either do not call or give you an incomplete update. For example, they failed to tell me that Liberty Mutual was going to call to request the receipt from the television. I asked Liberty Mutual how did they receive the information because Comcast did not inform me of any call from Liberty Mutual. If you call Comcast to ask for a status report, they will continue to tell you they are working on it. It got to the point where my granddaughter took $495.00 from her tuition money to replace the television set because they dragged this out for so long. In addition, I would have been sitting without a television set. I explained this to Comcast Corporate and they told me it was a personal decision to replace the television. First of all, am I really supposed to sit here without a television form November to January while they take their time? Comcast are thieves and they are disrespectful. My granddaughter needs to be reimbursed for the replacement of this television set.
__label__1 Comcast has so many call centers outside USA that suppose provide a customer service but is a scam. They take from you a personal information. Be aware if you dial the right customer services in USA.
__label__1 I have spoken with five different representatives regarding my address book. My group email is no longer working. I can't send a group email. I use my email for business. I have also sent emails and have been told that this would be fixed in 24 to 48 hours. The problem surfaced FIVE days ago. At this point I am unable to get even a live voice. This is very upsetting. Sending emails is even difficult. I PAY for Comcast internet, phone and TV and expect better service. HELP.
__label__1 I am being completely honest, Comcast lies to their customers constantly. All they want is their money. They bill you a month in advance because they are trying to get ahead to be considered a great company. You guy can go ** yourselves with spiked bats.
__label__1 I don't wish Comcast on my worst enemy!! I really believe they try to get customers and after 3 months when the contract is "official" this is when all the problem pops up. So I signed up with Comcast for internet and cable. I explained to the representative that I am working with a budget and I will like to hear options and best offer. Fast forward...the package I chose was $113.00 keeping in mind it was almost the end of the month and they charged me for the entire month. A week passed by. I got another bill for the upcoming month. Okay cool. I paid it thinking my cycle be said amount from now on. After my three months passed I got a letter in the mail stating that I was not charged for one of the boxes, therefore, they will have to add it to my bill. My bill went up to 126.00! I called to express my disappointment and disgust but you know the representative will be reading that script and keep saying, "I am sorry. I understand," to me. No!! You don't understand!! We had a verbal agreement!! Anyway nothing was done on their end to make me happy. I paid my bill. Next month I got my bill. It was $139.00. I was irate. I called again. Same crap about increase and taxes, and the whole works. Next month was $169.00. Some guy said my service was disconnected and it wasn't. I paid my bill and the customer representative I spoke with said he will waive the charge. He assured me that he just did it and my bill will be $110 next cycle. Well my bill came around and it's $134.00. I called again and another rep is telling me taxes went up and blah, blah...Well Comcast never disappoint. I went to check my mailbox today. Got a letter stating that I've been provided high definition and was not being charge for it. As a result they will be disconnecting it on the 28th July or I can add it for $9.99. The letter was so unprofessional. No dates. It wasn't signed. It was very vague. As usual their customer rep couldn't help but just poured out a bag of crap and said to me they gave me the wrong box. These people cannot be serious. I wish I read the reviews before I signed up. As a result my advice to people considering going with Comcast: Please reconsider!!
__label__1 Every single month for over a year I have had to call and refute unfair and (often times) unclear charges. I was always subject to contradictory and conflicting information from different representatives within the time period of the same phone call. For example, I signed up for a fixed rate of (about $120) for 12 months.. The first month's bill was $130, and as a result, had to spend about 20 minutes complaining to them that they messed up.. I ended up paying them anyway, then this happened for another two months.. (The second month was $140, the third was $154) and I called the 2nd and third month FURIOUS.The third phone call I spoke to a representative who told me that $120/month plan had already expired. I told him I was locked into that rate for a year.. Where after getting frustrated with me, he transferred me to another representative who told me that the first guy was completely wrong and that they were charging me for premium channels that I didn't have!!! After telling them that that is their mistake, not mine, they refused to take responsibility but did remove the unjustified charges from my account.Well that ordeal was a couple months ago, but literally I have had to call every single month to Comcast, just to refute the bill. Today I had enough and finally cancelled service once and for all. Please, NO ONE else should have to fall for their trap any longer! Tell your friends! Tell your social media friends and followers about them!! #NoCash2Comcast
__label__1 After seeing a promotion for $150 Visa Gift Card with bundled service, I decided to try Comcast. I was to have my service installed mid-October. The day before installation, I received a call from a rep telling me my installation needed to be rescheduled because there was no service contract on file. Without that, I could not receive my promotion. I was connected to a department where answers to their questions were recorded. It was a verbal agreement to a 2-year contract with them. I was told it would take 3 months to receive my gift card. When March arrived and I had not received my card, I called to inquire about it. I was told someone would get back to me. April came, and I called again. For the second time, I was told someone would get back to me. By the time May 2 came along, I was furious. I called and was told she personally would get back to me, which she did not. I called yet again on the 8th and the man gave me my word he would look further into this and he would personally call me before the day ended. Guess what? It never happened. This morning, I spoke to yet another rep. He put me on hold for a brief period of time and came back to tell me there was no contract on file. I insisted I did indeed have my conversation recorded for a verbal contract. Now he is looking into this, saying that without a contract, I could not qualify for the gift card. He gave me his number and extension and I am to call him in a week if no one gets back to me. I am beyond angry at this point. If they don't keep their word and send me my Visa card, they can take their service and shove it where the sun don't shine. I never had a problem with RCN. I should have stayed with them, but I will definitely be returning to them!
__label__1 I downgraded my TV/ internet package to be able to pay the same amount that I had been paying the previous 6 months (they raise the price by about $20.00 every 6 months). The package "Digital Starter" included HBO - except that the HBO appears only on the main TV and not on the second TV in the house. I spoke with Customer Solutions a second time and this time they informed me that for HBO (part of the package) to appear on the second TV, I have to get a different box that costs $10.00/month. They proceeded to tell me, using all kinds of double talk, about packages with different names, different benefits, different temporary costs, different speeds. There is nothing credible about Comcast and never anyone in the know to talk to. They are a despicable company and really need to be replaced with a responsible, reputable and customer service oriented company. For seniors, they are the WORST.
__label__1 Xfinity (Comcast) increased my monthly charge without noticing me, and the internet becomes unusable (several disconnects per night). After I contact the customer service, they are willing to refund me for only less than half of the overcharged part.
__label__1 Comcast has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. They are trained people who read what is required. Their system requires you to be on the phone handed off several times until you get to a person who makes promises of a package that is never delivered. Most of the people I believe aren't US Citizens because of their accents. There is a language barrier, a lack of respect. They will interrupt and have a rude undertone while reading "polite" scripted words that are untrue to their demeanor. It's obvious that they don't care and hand you off a million times, hoping you get frustrated and hang up. They lie to meet quota and I only hope that my area will have more cable options in the future.
__label__0 i have a problem with comcast cable co,i have been overcharged with cable,i called them to correct bill they said they would ckeck problem,i just paid bill ,174,00 the next day they shut off service,then they said they would turn it back on for another 236.00,i gave them 410.00 dollars that month, this month i get another bill this month for 393.89 dollars, a couple of months ago i signed a contract for 159 00 a month,but bill has never beencharged that amount.this problem has been going on for years,i have call this company several times, spoke to there supervisors, but nothing has been corrected,if you dont pay ,they shut you down,this is terrible that they can do what ever they want,i tried calling there corperate but i could not get throught, please hele me with this problem. thank you
__label__1 In November 2014, we declined further service due to increased cost. An offer from Comcast was solicited to continue for an acceptable cost. We had auto billing. Comcast pulled higher amount from checking and refused to refund overage. We called to cancel due to this discrepancy and was told the money was credited and again offered the agreed amount. We have the credit showing in our online account and have spent numerous hours communicating the billing error, however the balance from billing still shows the money due each month with added late fees. Billing has refused to adjust the mathematical error and we are now trying to finally cancel realizing Comcast is inept and not worth the frustration. Today, I tried twice to cancel and was told I was not allowed to because I am not authorized. I am a NOT authorized user in my account? What? This company is insane. My online account has me showing as an authorized user. Comcast claims their systems are different than what our online account is. We were also told that the billing problem was due to systems not communicating. We are done with Comcast. We just can't get them to LET us be done. The service representative could not tell me where to go locally to resolve this issue because her system was down. Seems like their systems are conveniently inefficient except for unauthorized automatic withdrawals. We have been in a winter storm warning with over a foot of snow. Today we are told we can go to a Comcast building and cancel IN PERSON. Why? I just want to cancel. I will take the unit in when it is safe to do so. NOT going to happen with Comcast. I'm pondering my options.
__label__1 So I've been with Comcast since November 2015 and have never had to call for any reason especially since I'm self sufficient with any electronics that come in and out of my home. I had to Call 4 times alone today, about a call I receive from Comcast on Monday about my account. Seems like calls are not monitored for q&a purposes, they do a very poor job at leaving notes, and clearly your system has been compromised. I have not signed my name and number to anything since signing up with them months ago for anything, and I received a fraud call from a rep claiming to work at Comcast's payment dept in Connecticut, requesting my information.After speaking with the reps today, not only was there no documentation of the call but the very last rep stated they no longer OB calls to customers for payment arrangements since April of this year. Never received a notice about it nor have I ever fallen behind before. The experience the CSR reps provide is clearly bottom of the barrel. Sorry to say, but I work for T-Mobile. I am a top performer and provide phenomenal customer service to any customer that calls. Hints: why we are ranked #1 JDP amongst all carriers. And I expect the same when I call. And just an FYI: for the superiors responsible for training the reps this way make sure you also remember: "no customers, no pay checks". Without "us" there is no "you".I understand why this company has ranked the very bottom 7 consecutive years, and for that reason the pay will always be poor for the reps and the company Will either go under due to loss of revenue or just barely floating above water. Know that customers like I will gladly pay the extra $10 for the same service with someone else for a better experience.
__label__1 After repeated service interruptions and other problems, I called the CEO of Comcast and talked to executive assistant, Michelle **. That was three days ago and never even got the courtesy of a call back after faxing my problems with service to her (and her boss, CEO Brian Roberts). Actually, I am not surprised as Comcast has demonstrated an absolute disregard for customer satisfaction in my personal opinion. I regarded this firm in high esteem and have been a customer for almost 17 years; however, the late customer service which is non-existent and this interaction (or lack there-of) with the executive office simply proves my point.I am a disabled veteran on a fixed income, battling cancer and two heart attacks within last 6 months, and this simply stinks. If you can't even get a response in a timely manner from the CEO's Office, how can you expect anything more from those under their supervision?
__label__1 I have Comcast Service at my home in Florida, as well as in New Jersey. Customer service appears to be outsourced, and attempting to explain a problem appears to "suffer in translation." I am now having problems in New Jersey, after attempting to deal with a problem in Florida with minimal success. I cringe at the possibility of having to call a Comcast representative again to resolve a problem. Shame on you, Comcast, I am not impressed that you just got your name atop an iconic building in NYC. You should be focusing your efforts on BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
__label__1 Had to call 3 times approx 2 hrs total to simply TURN ON my internet. I had my own modem and everything. Had to cycle through 3 people before someone knew what they were doing. They were trying to scam me by saying I needed a tech to come out to hook up my internet for me ($115)... Unacceptable. Every time you call you are automatically greeted by an automated system. You can not get through to a person. Period. You have to waste 10 mins of your life talking to a computer to speak to an agent.Random PING spikes. Occasionally my ping will spike to 500, which ruins any interactive feature of the internet, gaming, Skype, etc. It is just a terrible service. And of course I call to get a credit to my bill for this unacceptable latency and I have to spend 10 minutes in the automated process, only for the process to tell me that it will call me back when an agent is available in... you guessed it, 10 minutes. Took that 10 mins to write this review. Still waiting for a call back.
__label__1 I've had Comcast for 6 months now. I had the HD package for 2 rooms. I first called to take off On Demand they refused then tried to give me a 30% discount on one bill. I refused. He told me to go to my local center. The second time I call because my second room box only had cable they told me I needed to take it in for service. He offers Starz as a free sorry after no help. Clarified free. Well I call again because my bill is now $224! He ADDED STARZ AS A PACKAGE AND A PHONE LINE. The lady says "Sorry we cannot take your package off after it's done." So I say "OK cancel it." Of course they can change it back then but after I pay this bill that was supposed to be FREE. He should pay it! No discount or nothing for his fault. She gives my basic package back locked in for 12 months. This is not right to do to your customers. If it wasn't for fast internet I would be long gone. Always trying to scam money. Shame on you.
__label__1 Had a $300 charge on my account from Comcast when my bill was $0. That bounced 11 little payments, now with charges it's $775.00 plus that money was for daughter's prom. What a problem. Been to BBB, FCC.
__label__0 Comcast is charging their existing customers in good standing that pays their bill every month more money than new customers.  The long standing customers also does not qualify for bundle package because we are OLD customers.  This is not fair and is not right.  I just received notice that my DVR service is going up and i have only had that service for 2 months.I want the bundle package at the same rate new customers are getting or at the very least do not increase my bill whenever they have a special promotion for new customers.
__label__0 monopoly in my state, they are priced well out of range for many average income families. I was without internet service for over a month because of an error on their part and never compensated except for offering me a $20 discount on that months bill. I asked for wireless, but it was not installed and therefore can't use any of the itouch products my family has. In order to get someone to fix that I will have to pay through the nose to have someone come set it up. I have never been so disappointed with service from any company and can't wait until the day I have an alternative to using them!
__label__1 I reiterated over and over again the cost and fees associated with our new contract when I renewed. I know from past experience that Comcast will say one thing and when the bill is received it says another. Well we went from $129 to $169 monthly fee and they charged for the new equipment. In our initial conversation I repeated over and over "there is no charge for the DVR?" I was told "no." Well yes there was! I asked them to access the "recorded" conversation! Yeah right. Bait and switch! Switching to DirecTV.
__label__0 We had Comcast Cable in 2006 when we lived in Troy, Michigan. They lost a check we wrote to pay our bill in April 2006. When we moved from Troy in June 2006 we paid our bill in full and closed our account. In December 2008 that missing check was cashed through our checking account by Comcast. I attempted to contact Comcast that we didn't owe them any money and didn't even have and account with them any longer. Funny, they couldn't find our account. When I tried to ask where they applied this money to, no one could tell me. I did talk to one very nice supervisor, Sylvia who said she would attempt to get me my refund check. 8 weeks and 9 phone calls later, I still don't have my money. I get a run around every time I call. Employees won't let me speak with a supervisor when I call. They are too busy and take my number to have someone call me back, but I never get a return phone call. Comcast must be making a fortune on billing mistakes and since there is no accountability, someone is walking off with the cash. Maybe this is how Comcast funds their bonuses for their employees? I realize that $48.95 isn't a lot of money and I probably have spent more than that in time now trying to get it back. It is the principle of it. I have tried calling, sending them an e-mail and letters - who do you report something like this to and get any results?
__label__1 I first got Comcast over a year ago at my apartment. I got everything set up and ready to go while on the phone with them, and asked them if I could make my first payment ahead of time. Whomever I spoke with proceeded to tell me my first month was free since I was a new customer. I did not remember ever seeing that anywhere, but was also happy when they mentioned it. So my first bill comes and it is double what my bill was supposed to be and it says I have a late fee added since I did not pay my first bill!Confused I called the customer service which btw is terrible!!! The lady I spoke with was so unbelievably rude I was in such shock. Telling me that I do not know what I am talking about, etc. She hung up on me eventually. I was so angry. They continued to add late charge fees even after I paid my bill. After 4 months of having Comcast I cancelled because I was so angry with the way they treated me. I swore I would never get them again...To my luck, my new house I just moved into only receives Comcast in this area. So I signed up for Comcast internet and they quoted me 59.99 a month for a speed of 105. I picked up the modem and went to call to activate it. Comcast then told me my account had been cancelled. (WTF) I had just started service with them 4 days prior! So then I got transferred a total of 8 times and was asked to verify who I was 15 times making the phone call a total of 3 hours. Eventually I was able to get my original rate back for the same speed (or so they told me).I was not getting any internet whatsoever... The speed was sooo slow I could not even load one page on the internet. Angry and confused I call them back to now find out that I am paying 59.99 a month for a speed of only 50. They then proceed to put me on hold for 25 mins two times! Saying to have 105 speed I need to pay $20 extra a month. I am now not happy. After arguing they then reduce it down to only an extra $5 a month. So now my plan is $65.99 a month. I then proceed to ask for them to email me over my price sheet and contract so I have evidence and a paper trail of all of this and he tells me that he is not able to do that. I HATE COMCAST !!! What can you do to fight back against them if they try to overcharge me, etc. They make me worried to have them as a company. They are stupid, liars, and not trustworthy.
__label__5 Comcast's customer service is non-existent. There aren't any adjectives in the English language nor are there enough expletives to describe Comcast's horrific customer service. No one seems to know what's going on. There is no inside communication between reps and management. We were moving and wanted to transfer our service to the new address. We gave Comcast a two week notice and they gave us an appointment for the day after we moved in. The tech shows up but he said he couldn't do anything because the line had been cut and they would have to have a street crew come out and run another line underground from the box that's located across the street. The street crew came out a week later and ran the line, now we have to make another appointment for a tech to come out. Now we have an appt. 6 days away. To make a long story short, we had service... so we thought. After the tech left, later that evening the picture went out. I dread calling Comcast customer service, but it's something we as customers must do when a problem arises. The rep tells us she needs the serial numbers off all three boxes. These should already be in the system because these are the same boxes we had prior to moving. To add insult to injury, they had us down as having 4 boxes. During that phone call the rep offered us home phone service and told us what our bill would be. I asked how soon would the phone service be available and she said about 20 mins. After hanging up, we didn't have any phone service, so I had to call back the next day. The rep I talked to didn't see any notes on our account about an added home phone service. He said he could go ahead and add it for us, but when he told us the price it was almost $20 more than what the previous rep had told us. Nevertheless, we get the home phone service at his price and still the same issue. No HOME PHONE SERVICE! I left out the long period of time we were on hold both days to even speak with a rep. I called back the next day and asked for a manager and after being on hold forever, I finally got one only to be told he would look into it and give me a call back. Comcast customers already know this but we never received that phone call. After a couple more calls to customer service we finally got our home phone service. It wouldn't have been an issue because we have cell phones, but we have 2 girls that are sometimes home alone so we decided to go with it. I read every customer review on here before I posted my review, and none of them surprised me. It should be against the law, but there's nothing we can do about it! Oh, Comcast is supposed to be adding about 5500 reps. That won't do any good if they are untrained and have bad attitudes! 
__label__1 I called to have my service downgraded at the end of the month and was told that was possible. I asked to have my service changed from Blast 30mbps to Performance 20mbps internet. The next day, my internet speeds were at the Performance Starter level - 6mbps! So they not only downgraded my service prematurely, but they also dropped me down two levels! I'm paying $150 for my triple play bundle and they give me the second from the slowest internet speed! Wrong on two accounts! I wish there was another cable option in my area. These regional monopolies are hurting the customer. There is little regard for the customer's satisfaction because there are no other real options and Comcast knows it. I'm not going to DSL because that's worse. I wish Fios was in my area. 
__label__0  After talking with several supervisors they told me that their system is infailable and that we watched those movies and will be charged for them. I immediately canceled my service for both cable and internet with them. I have not been able to find a way to talk with anyone higher then the "supervisors' who wont help me. Is there a way to speak to someone higher up in the corporation? We are being charged $100.00 that we will not pay which means this will affect our credit.
__label__1 Yesterday, after holding for over an hour to contact technical support for assistance, an original appt was schedule for 6/2/14 however I requested an appointment for TODAY, thus the technician stated he will advise his supervisor to update the scheduled appointment for TODAY. The technician confirm my appointment for TODAY!!! However, when I contact customer service, I was laughed at, kept getting "I apologize", but no resolution. A lead representative had the audacity to say "technical calls are always scheduled in my area at that time & day". Let's just say I took offense to that comment, on top of the snickering and laughter in the background as I am trying to get some resolution. Direct TV is beginning to look better.
__label__0 I scheduled a technician to come out and install two high definition DVR's and progrm them so I could get my cable service upgraded to the new requirements of Comcast.  The technician came out and hooked up the two DVR's and "programmed" them.  I had to call customer service three times after his visit to have the DVR's reprogrammed because the on screen TV Guide would not work.Approximately one week later, I had a technician come out to replace a burnt out Internet modem and while there, he checked out the DVR's and found that they had not been programmed correctly.  The "On Demand" option was also not working.  I also discovered that the first technician did not hook up the epuipemnt properly.  I had replaced four VCR's and an old cable converter box with the two DVR's.  He had not removed any of the extra cabling, but had just used one of the five cables and associated hardware to hook up the DVR's.I then had to undo all of the cables, properly wire up the DVR's and remove the extra cable items.  I contacted the cable company and was told to contact my local office as this was not their problem.  The local office has no phone number access, and I am not able, at this time, to physically go in to file a complaint.  I was charged $51.99 for services rendered in an unsatisfactory manner and would like to be reimbursed.
__label__1 Never have I had so many problems with cable/Internet before. Every month it is something with either the Internet connection or the cable box itself. We have the X1 BOX. Do NOT get it. You will regret it. Then they want to charge us an arm and a leg to downgrade to the original box. After complaining so many times you would think they would fix their problems and make Comcast better, but no. They just want to take your money. We tried to get DirecTV when we moved into our house, but there wasn't a good spot. I'm at the point where I don't care anymore. I would have wires over stupid "connection" issues day after day. Comcast sucks. Don't bother with it.
__label__1 Paid my bill on the 2nd of March. Service was cut off because they did not add my payment to my bill.
__label__1 I got a promotion in the mail to move to Comcast and bundle. On June 6, 2014 Comcast came to provide service. They worked on it for two days. No service yet but we received the bill. Called to correct the problem and charges. They are saying call back.
__label__0 I contacted Comcast as I was having problems connecting to the Internet after my son had gotten through fooling around with my computer. Unlike many of you who had problems with Comcast, I was rather hesitant to even deal with them after hearing all of your horror stories. To my delight, I spoke with a young gentleman who was more than willing to walk me through the troubleshooting process on my computer. As I am not the most savvy user in the world, I expected my new Comcast friend to become frustrated - he did not. He was wonderful. Although I needed to have a technician sent to my home to look at the problem, my call center experience was wonderful.The installation/service technician that came to my home was equally enjoyable and knowledgeable with the products and services his Company offered. As it turned out, the modem I had needed to be replaced. Was I mad at Comcast. No - they were wonderful. My modem was replaced, all of the television fittings in my home were checked, I was offered credit to my account for my inconvenience, and was given a business card with my technicians name on it with his cell telephone number should I have any problems down the road. I don't know about your poor experiences you've had with Comcast, but I can tell you, although they are a service provider, you get a lot more using honey than vinegar. I was respectful of the representatives efforts, which was reciprocated 10 fold. Think about that before you call and freak out!
__label__1 I just noticed a $7 charge on my statement for a cable modem. I have had my own modem for the last 2 years and apparently after my last conversation with a Comcast agent last month, I got a charge for using my own modem. When I asked the agent today (April 15, 2013), she removed it and told me, "It is a mistake and so we are removing it." Nothing else! There is no guarantee that she would have removed the charge if I did not notice it today. I had to point it to her to remove the charge.I also changed my service on March 22, 2013 and was promised a monthly charge of $138.22. I got my bill today and it's $40 more. When I asked the agent what happened, she told me that she has no record of the $138! It's only that I spoke to an agent on 03/22 showing up on the record. Interestingly, I got no emails from Comcast for my service change on 03/22. Every time, in the past, they send me a note when I change services. This is very poor customer service and highly unreliable. Always check your monthly bills before you pay all those sneaky charges.
__label__1 According to 24/7 Wall St and research survey group Zogby Analytics. Polled adults regarding the quality of customer service at 151 of Americas best-known companies in 15 industries. "Comcast has had bottom-ranked customer service for seven consecutive years. Comcast had the worst customer service reviews of any company this year by a wide margin. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. 1. Comcast > Pct. ratings poor: 28.3%. At 28.3%, more respondents ranked their experience with the company as poor than any other company. Furthermore, 54.4% of those surveyed claimed that their overall customer experience was negative, nearly 10 percentage points higher than the next worst rated company. This is Comcast's seventh consecutive year on the Hall of Shame, and its first year at the top".Business Insider rates Comcast #6 for the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. CheatSheet rates Comcast #1 for the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. According to the American Consumer Satisfaction Index's Comcast #3 for the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. Consumerist Named Comcast THE WORST COMPANY IN AMERICA. Comcast finds itself at the bottom of the American Consumer Satisfaction Index's. Forresters annual report rates Comcast as the lowest TV Service Provider. Consumer Reports also placed Comcast's customer satisfaction near the bottom of the telecom industry. Shall I go on.One customers story. I have been with Comcast for over 18 years. The past several years it is rare that I don't spend hours on the phone on a monthly basis attempting to correct problems with the service or the bill. My internet and phone service has been down for several days at a time - more than a few times in the past 2 years. I have had the cable modem changed out 3 times in as many weeks. Each time I was told the modem did not work or was not the modem. Regarding my bill that was supposed to be consistent if I agreed to a 2 year contract I have called almost on a monthly basis in an attempt to correct. Every month I am told one or a combination of these excuses: 1 - The previous agent did not code it correctly. 2 - The previous agent was incorrect. 3 - The previous agent made notes but did not complete the changes/corrections.Each month I am promised that they would make the proper corrections. The future bills would be correct. I am given exact dates when it will change. Some have even given me their direct phone #. Last month my calls were never returned from this direct #. And yet this months bill was almost double the amount. I have spent dozens and dozens of hours on the phone. Not counting service calls. Even calling Comcast Corporate (BTW the last person not to return a call was the agent assigned to my previous complaint by Comcast Corporate). I have thought about switching to Dish or DirecTV. But they are rated #4 and #2 WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE respectively. I really enjoy the products. However, the time and extreme aggravation caused by the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE leaves me looking and wishing for an alternative.
__label__1 I literally had the service for three days yes THREE days and ever since then I've been unable to watch cable. Called customer service they sent a signal to the box and the problem to exist. Called back another signal was sent and still NOTHING. They claim they credited my account. A technician was scheduled to come out Tuesday between 3-5 no one ever showed up, but got a call from a tech saying I wasn't home. Mind you I never left home Sat on my couch in front of my wind NO ONE stepped foot on my pavement let alone my porch.Called customer service once again re-scheduled the appointment for the same day between 4-7. Received a call at about 6:00 from a nasty ignorant chick saying my appointment was cancelled and I need to call them back to re-schedule no explanation as to why it was cancelled. Mind you my service is still not working... I'll be cancelling the service and returning their equipment and going with FIOS... Comcast SUCKS big time. Only had the service for THREE days and already had to go through the bull crap...
__label__1 Comcast canceled the TV guide channel 96. What a cheap ass company! Now you have to upgrade to a more expensive TV package just to get the TV guide channel. Plan to dump Comcast.
__label__0 Comcast is the only cable provider for the area where my wife and I moved. After the initial installation was completed, we had problems with the 1st and 2nd cable receivers installed and also very slow internet speed. It was determined by the 3rd technician that we had a weak signal. He said he would be back in the next day or two to resolve the problem. That didn't happen, and I had to call Comcast and set up another appointment. The 4th tech came and worked on the problem. In the process of fixing the slow speed internet problem, he did something to my computer so that now I have no access to the programs, firewall or anti-virus protection. (These were turned off during his troubleshooting and not turned back on and are still off because I do not have proper authorization. That is what pops up when I try to access.) I contacted the Comcast Damage Claims Dept. and Martin came out and said that it was not a Comcast problem. After which I spoke to his supervisor (I believe his name is Richard), and he said the same thing. They will not take responsibility for the fact that before they did whatever they did in setting up the internet, that they changed the configuration and settings that allow me to use my computer. I am told by Richard that I have to take my computer to a bona fide computer specialist at my expense to get it fixed.  I do not feel that I should have to pay for their improper techniques or inadequacy of computer knowledge that caused this problem. The problem did not exist before they set up the internet, entered my computer and changed my configuration. I have not taken the computer to a specialist yet.
__label__1 39.95 a charge of an alleged installation that never occurred. I received my invoice for payment and to my surprise had a rate of 39.95, a facility that supposedly never happened. Every month I am having a problem with Comcast, or service is not 100%, or has a Charging an extra fee, or I need to call because the internet is very slow but never asked the customer service to send someone here to install my cable box. Was prompted by a visit from an attendant technician because for years I've been paying for 25 Gbs internet and in fact I had only 2.5 Gbs. This was the reason why the technician came up to my house, not to install the cable box or install something else, but to try to get the service I got.Today (09/10) called to complain about this charge, and I was told it would be an open petition to see if I was telling the truth or not. Honestly, any small child can install a cable box, and I do not need to pay 40.00 for one person come up to my house and connect 3 cables in a box. I decided to open this complaint because I'm sick of this crap service I got here. I live at this address are eight, and eight years I have Comcast, and all week I have to call and ask for help, because I do not have internet or my TV not have a image. And the biggest problem is the monopoly that they do, or I use Comcast or AT&T, which is also another company that the service sucks. SO I do not have another company that I can choose for internet service this area. I spoke with an attendant tonight and after nearly 40 minutes on the phone he hung up. I called again and asked to speak to a supervisor, but the clerk did not want to pass the call to the supervisor.
__label__1 I cannot access my Xfinity router to reset the username and password. I have reset it several times according to the manual but I am still receiving an error message. I called Comcast to ask for help. I was informed that if I purchased additional Tech Support services, they would then help me. When I refused to subscribe to additional services to simply get help on how to reset my password and username, I was told to "feel free to browse the internet for a solution". This is unacceptable customer service, I'm very disappointed.
__label__1 Comcast techs were back today, and yet again they've left a tangled mess. I approached a tech and asked if he would untangle the wires before leaving. He happily responded, "I don't have the authority to untangle the wires..." Despite the tech acknowledging tangled wires can be dangerous, he left. The photo shows how Comcast techs pride their work. It's sloppy, ugly, dangerous and dumb.
__label__5 We received a phone call to offer us Comcast Triple Play. The offer sounded good and we could finally get all of our services under one company. Beforehand, we had Verizon for our phone service and our phone bills were way too high. We decided to sign up for Comcast Triple Play and our initial service call was on 2 July. The installer came and placed three new set top boxes in the house with new controllers. I asked about the internet and phone, but he said that wasn't his job and someone would call to set up the rest of the services. Within 36 hours, none of the cable boxes were working. This was a disaster---World Cup Soccer was on and we weren't able to watch it! My husband called a toll free number for Comcast and got someone in NY that talked him through getting at least one of the set top boxes working (it took nearly an hour). On 7 July, another installer came out to take care of the internet connection for us and he did a great job; apparently the first tech that showed up didn't complete the job correctly and left quite a few issues unchecked. When he started looking at taking care of the phone connection, he was totally flummoxed due to the fact we have a security system with two lines. He couldn't do the job---and at least he admitted it. (Note: We asked for a tech after 25 Jul as we had company). The next installer arrived on 27 July and started to take care of the remaining internet issues (which I thought were completed). He was here nearly four hours and at the end of it, the only thing he accomplished was to re-establish the phone lines with Comcast from Verizon. He was unable to complete the job due to our security system which has two lines (one goes directly to the police). We were assured that we would have a tech out today to finish the process, but after two phone calls (leaving messages) for the supervisor, we still have no idea when the tech will show up. Needless to say, my husband is livid that Comcast is so inept and said that we shouldn't have opted for their Triple Play offer. Unfortunately, I'm beginning to see that he was right---although it seemed a good offer to save us money. Not sure that it is worth all the aggravation and wasted time.
__label__0 As soon as I can I'm getting rid of Comcast. I'm so tired of the run around and being passed from one billing associate to another. On Oct 15 I called to have my high speed internet downgraded. I just lost my job and I need to cut back. As soon as I got off the phone I went to my computer to refresh the page and got a limited or no connection error. I called back and the tech tried to renew my IP address online. No luck. They sent out a tech who spent several hours trying and left saying it was my ethernet card and I needed to replace it. I told him the computer was working fine until I downgraded. He said these things happen. He said he wasn't going to charge me for the service call because he wasn't sure if that really was the problem.I replaced the ethernet card, still no connection, so I took my computer to a computer repair shop. There was no problem with my computer there. So I brought it home and hooked it back up, still no connection. Another Comcast tech came out and a couple hours later told me it was my computer. Someone had told me once that McAfee, that is provided by Comcast had blocked their IP address. So I uninstalled it. Viola' I had internet. After all that and 2 weeks with no computer. I called the tech back and he sid to call Comcast and tell them what happened. They said they would deduct 2 weeks from my bill. I just got my bill. $164.00. They billed me for the high speed performance that I downgraded from, charged me for the service call that the first guy said I wouldn't be charged for, charged me for a service call the billing associate couldn't explain. Okay I got all that taken care of and I've yet to see the 2 weeks deducted from my bill. I was passed around from one billing associate to another and finally I called again the next day after my bill was reduced to $91.16. The automated voice message said it was $115. I called and he said he would disreguard that bill. Told me to add up the $54.00 cable and $24.95 internet, $3.00 modem rental and with the taxes it's suppose to total $91.16?? What are we suppose to do when you can't get them to correct your bills?
__label__0 I just want to express my extreme dissatisfaction with Comcast's supposed Hi-Speed Internet. What a joke for the money paid each month!
__label__0 First of all, this happened back in the beginning of August the 1st, which I had 30 days to decide what I wanted to do. When I first spoke to the lady, who signed me up with the contract, I specifically told her I work for LabCorp and I asked her about the corporate discount. She said, we can give you a discount but with the package you have, it would be cheaper. So I decided to stay with the package. Then she told me, what I can do for you to substitute the discount is not to charge you for the installation and box fee. I told her, are you sure? She said, "Yes and it would be only $29.99 plus tax. All I have to do is put a note and notify my supervisor. They'll call you back in 24 to 48 hours". Since then, it has been the worst 3 weeks of my life. They never called me back and Paula, the supervisor, was really unprofessional.
__label__1 Consumer beware. I found out that my internet usage has been capped at 300 gb only after I received an outrageous bill from Comcast. Apparently, they are now allowing up to 300 gb of data usage only, and after exceeding this limit you are charged an additional $10 per 50gb thereafter. Apparently, they are only doing this so called test in certain areas of the country and are working on making this a national requirement. It may not be affecting you now but if you're a Comcast customer, it will be affecting you soon. If this isn't gouging the customer I don't know what is. Where is the regulatory force on this one? It's only a matter of time Comcast. We are at a day and age when it's nearly impossible to do anything without using the internet. Just about every facet of our lives are intertwined with data usage such as school, bill pay, entertainment, research, business, banking, etc., the list goes on and you go and pull this **? Sucker the consumer in and stick it to them, the American way eh Comcast? Too bad I don't have any other options, you would have been canned a long time ago, but somehow I think you know that.
__label__1 Comcast Xfinity service is abysmal - I switched back to Comcast from Verizon after 3 years when the salesman promised that things are different now after they started with their Xfinity service. There were initial hiccups for sure when I considered opting out as they had the 30-day guarantee, but I stuck with it. It seemed to get a little better over time but then, the problem started with the phone service that most Xfinity triple play customers are now familiar with - you can hear the other party but they cannot hear you a few minutes into the call and you need to redial. Comcast has not been able to do anything about it. There were disruptions of internet service but except on a few days, it was alright. Yesterday (June 1, 2012), there was a major outage for 3 or 4 hours and when I called Comcast, they said the problem affected our area (Dayton, NJ) and technicians were working on it but could not give an ETA for resolution. The service did come back later but for the last 24+ hours, I've been having interruptions on phone service every few minutes when the line goes dead without a dial tone. The internet cuts off as well, and I have been recycling the modem every few minutes. I think Comcast does not have the wherewithal to run a huge data network and their technicians are the least knowledgeable in data networking. I am terribly mad and am thinking of switching out regardless of their termination fee. I rely on internet service for work. God knows how they are able to advertise high speed internet service for businesses when they are unable to deliver a decent service to households. I will never recommend their service - No internet and no phone service from Comcast - to anyone (except their TV).
__label__1 I accepted an offer for 69$ a month then my first bill was 169$ including installation fees (I self installed my devices) and my monthly rate was upraised to 129 a month. I spent 2 days on the phone with them to solve the issue. They solved it. I went 3 times to customer center because the first 2 times they gave me wrong modem and cable box and I spent 3 hours on the phone with the technical support then they figured out that the modem and cable box were not working and that I had to go again to customer center and to the line and request a new one..TWICE!After a month I then chose to cancel my service because all of these issues and they answered me that I am a VALUED CUSTOMER and that they wanted to offer me a better rate for $45 a month. I accepted it. I checked my account after 24 hours and I found again a bill for 129$ my monthly rate that was originally 69$ and that should have become $45 was instead $85! Then the balance was for installation (I already had everything installed as you can read on top) and other weird charges. I am still trying to figure out how to find a solution. DO NOT DO COMCAST.
__label__1 When our mobile home park stopped including Comcast Cable TV without space rent, we were forced by default to subscribe to Comcast's Service. I agreed to a trial month and paid $59 to view nothing but junk and tried to contact our local Comcast office on Figueroa and Lomita Blvd. I later found out the store had closed and sold to Time Warner. I was unable to get a hold of anyone at Comcast. I unplugged the black cable box and put it in my closet.Months later I started getting mailings for Time Warner, some other cable company that was soliciting their services. I was not interested and threw what I thought was junk mail in the trash. Finally, out of curiosity, I opened one of the envelopes to find a telephone number to ask them to take me off their mailing list. That is when I saw that they were charging me hundreds of dollars for cable service that had been transferred from the old erroneous Comcast billing. I called and spoke with an agent who was able to zero out my account, with the exception of the $210 owed for the black cable box. She said I could return it in person at the Hermosa Beach Office on Valley Drive. So, I did.It's been a few years now so I don't remember the dates. I honestly thought everything was going to be good to go, but as you will see. It is not. I gave the receptionist (one of three sassy black girls running the show which is an odd sight in a beach town like Hermosa). I gave her the black box and she turned her monitor so I could see the final balance of $210 disappear into a nice zero! Finally, I was stoked! Another black helper gave me what I thought was a receipt of the printer and I went on my merry way.I know it was a busy day and I didn't read the paper until months later when I got another bill from Time Warner. I opened it in great expectation to see the glorious zero balance and was shocked to see a $420 charge for the $210 [that was supposedly credited I had seen the screen] and now for an additional $210 [that they were saying was for the box that they claimed had never been returned?]What craziness is this? I immediately wrote an accurate and in depth letter to the main customer complaint office in El Segundo and followed up with a phone call with yet, another sassy black woman. She was unreasonable, rude, threatening and hostile insisting that I owed their company this money. This is wrong. I don't owe them a penny. They have put this false charge on my credit report and continually call one of my son's phone numbers and harass him. I want them to nullify any charge against me and to fire those cross-prejudiced war mongers who disguise themselves as customers service agents.
__label__1 I recently discovered that Comcast erroneously sent an incorrect bill to a collection company under my name and social security number. This erroneous report damaged my credit at a time when I was in the process of purchasing a home. I recently discovered this error and have asked Comcast to send me a copy of the bill that was erroneously established using my information. Since this happened in 2010 the representative I spoke with today, ID **, is stating that she can't pull up this statement even though other Comcast representatives have told me that they can.Comcast is insisting that this was a case of Identity theft and not a mistake of Comcast. I've filed a police report at the advice of Comcast and even the officer taking the report suspects that it was a mistake by Comcast. I feel that I am entitled to receiving the statement that damaged my credit but have tried many ways of getting this without cooperation from Comcast.
__label__1 I made an appointment for (free) technical service over the phone and confirmed it when called by their automated appointment confirmation line. No technician ever arrived. There was no communication from the company regarding technician status, no cancellation, no apology for the missed appointment, and no attempt to contact me to reschedule. I called asking how they would make it up to me and they said they would not charge me for a technician to visit at another time. In other words, they fabricated a service charge and then tried to use it as a way to reimburse me for time off taken to meet their technician.I asked for a $100 credit. A service technician is paid roughly $50 for a half day. I took a half day off and will have to take another half day off to meet a technician who may or may not show up. An account credit for $100, at their own low rate for that time, is logical and reasonable. I asked why the technician did not show for the appointment and why no attempt was made to remedy this or contact me and was told by the agent that "there is no reason why. I don't know."
__label__1 When I called the infinity customer service center to complain about the new slow performance speed the first question customer service asked was "How fast is it now and why didn't you buy the previous offer for the faster service." I responded with "What speed is my plan am I paying for now." I explained to customer service the actual test was less than half that. The customer service rep said she would resend a signal to my router. No improved speed occurred. I turned on my hotspot on my cell phone to file this complaint. I am getting screw from Comcast/Xfinity. My internet speed is not what I pay for.
__label__1 Went to end my service, and the guy acted like he didn't want to do it and was very rude about it. My bill has been going up and up for no reason. I said just cancel, just like that, I didn't want to have a conversation, especially with such a rude person. Then the douche hung up on me like nothing. Customer Service at Comcast has to be the worst.
__label__1 We pay about $325/month for internet, cable TV and telephone service from Comcast. Although we live in an older home that previously had cable service, it took over a dozen visits to our home by Comcast at the time of installation to get the service working. We finally hired an outside consultant at our own expense, who installed a booster to get our WiFi service working throughout the house. We have had problems after problems in the five years we have had "service" through Comcast. This week, our HD cable box/DVR failed and a technician arrived to say that Comcast was experiencing a "shortage" of DVR boxes, and that he would "try" to find us one. He left without replacing the broken box or advising us when we would receive a replacement.
__label__0 What a mistake they were nothing like I thought for a internet provider. We always had service interruptions and slow speeds. Come to find out they had to take a trap off our line to be close to the speed that we were supposed to get and after a month they tried to charge us for more TV channels. The funny thing is we do not have any TVs in the house so finally after 3 months they removed the price difference but never gave is credit for it. Also if you do not pay them right away they turn you in to a credit service and trash your credit even if it was their mistake about the billing, I know this because it happened to me 7 times and even tho they issue was taken care of and yes a 7 times were errors on there side my credit is still tarnished from this to this day. Oh and by the way it was not like we were out in the sticks, we were located less than 6 miles from the main Comcast building.After 5 months those smart asses came back out and put the trap back on the line and did not tell us and flat out denied it when I asked them but I could see the trap on the cable up on the pole. After I told them that they were full of it they fessed up after about an hour. I was out of service for the total of 41 days in a 1 year time and many service glitches. It never would surprise me when I came home from work and found out that I had no internet. Finally in April 2008 we were pleased to find out that AT&T Uverse was available with high speed internet in my area.We called them and it was hooked up in less than 5 business days and running. Since then we only had 2outages and they lasted no longer that a few minutes and the speeds are much faster than Comcast ever was. Customer support is really good threw AT&T also. Biggest thing is about Comcast is they will keep changing and raising your bill and you never know month to month of what it will be.About a month ago we had new families move in to the neighborhood and I told them the horror stories about Comcast. All the families except for 1 went with AT&T except for my next door neighbor but after a month of horrible service and outages he went with AT&TAfter 5 months those smart asses came back out and put the trap back on the line and did not tell us and flat out denied it when I asked them but I could see the trap on the cable up on the pole.

__label__0 I am, at this point, so frustrated and angry at Comcast that I don't know where to start. I've been a Comcast customer for many years (about 10). I think and while I've been bombarded with Verizon FiOs ads and reps coming to my house, I've remained with Comcast. But in recent years, it has been my observation that Comcast is its own worst enemy. And my experiences of the last month may have been the straw that will cause me to switch to Verizon as have virtually all of my neighbors.For the past year, ending 2/27/10, I've been on a triple play promotion, paying $140 every month. Knowing that my next bill would jump to the full price, I called Comcast in early March to see if there were any new promotions I could get on because I had no intention of paying more than what I had been paying for the past year. After a discussion with a rep from the "Customer Retention" section, I was told that I would now be on a plan costing $122 and change plus taxes and fees, which would put my next bill at something around $130 which was fine.Within two days of that discussion, I received a letter from Comcast (not a flyer, a letter addressed directly to me) with the header: "An exclusive thank you for being one of our most valued customers. Including a new monthly discount." The discounts described in the letter were a $10 Triple Play Rewards Credit and a $25 Valued Customer Credit, for a total monthly credit of $35 for the next 12 months as long as I maintained my current level of service. Subtracting the credits from the regular $157 price results in the same $122 that the Customer Retention rep gave me, which I had thought was a "deal" but turns out he was only giving me the same total discount that Comcast was telling me about via the letter. But no problem.Then about 10 days ago we were having trouble with our TV service (tiling, sound drop-outs) and called for a technician to investigate. He arrived late and informed me that as a result, I would get a $20 credit on my next statement. So I expected to see a total bill of around $110, including taxes and fees, for my first off-promotion bill. I have been on auto-pay for years, and happened to check my checking account online this morning. To my shock, I saw that Comcast had taken $136.93 from my account for this month, which means that without the $20 late technician credit it would have been about $157. I immediately called and talked to "Ruth" in Customer Retention.I told her about my discussion with another rep a few weeks ago saying that my next bill would be for $122 (excluding taxes and fees) and the letter I had gotten from Comcast giving me $35 in credits for the next year, which would also have taken the bill down to the same $122. The first two things she said after looking up my account was that (a) I had not been put on any $122 plan, and (b) (this was the real shocker!) the $35-credit letter had been sent to me in error! At that point, I lost it, telling her in no uncertain terms that Comcast was a liar and that I wanted the company to credit me the $35 I had been promised. However, given this most recent experience, I don't believe anything a Comcast rep tells me, so I have removed auto-pay from my account settings so that I can control what I pay. Whether or not the $35 credit I was promised by the rep I talked to weeks ago and in the letter from Comcast, I will pay only the $122 plus fees and taxes. And if I don't get the credit for having overpaid for March, I will deduct that, too. If Comcast has a problem with what I pay, I'm off to Verizon! If you're thinking about getting Comcast, better think again.
__label__1 Comcast blocked my business number by adding their own phone number to my account. I received new service today that did not include a phone number. They added one with no paperwork and no authorization. I have now been on the phone 5 hours and it is still not resolved. I have been hung up on, transferred, switched to departments, and had the line just go dead. No one has ever called me back. I still have no access to my business line and my clients cannot reach me. I also cannot access my voicemails. Comcast personnel have lied to me all day.
__label__0 My internet service with Comcast was disconnected for one year because Comcast claims that I was using too much bandwidth. I had been warned before but the person I talked to told me to purchase bandwidth monitoring software. If Comcast wants their customers to stay within certain limits, then they should provide bandwidth monitoring software. I should not have to purchase something like that myself. It should be provided by Comcast. When I opened my cellular account, I purchased a specific number of minutes that I can use every month. Whenever I want to find out how many minutes I have used, all I have to do is sign into my account and I can find out how many minutes I have used. Comcast does not have any such tool.
__label__1 After sitting on hold for almost an hour, we finally got someone.  We explained what happened.  She was told over and over that the old computer was not wifi.  We were transferred several times.  We could not get it through anyone's head that the computer was not wifi.  this literally went on for about 4 hours with no resolution.  We were then transferred (since it was after hours) to someone in India who barely spoke English.  After another 2 hours, it still wasnt resolved.  About a week later, a serviceman showed up (3 hours late on a Sunday).  He finally got it up and running.  Mind you, I run an internet business out of my home.  I ended up having to refund my customers almost $1000.00 due to Comcast's inability to take care of their customers.  And to top it off, I was billed for a Sunday call!  We returned the old modem to the office.  We are still being billed $8.95 a month for a modem that was returned.
__label__0 Canceled services because none of our promotional deals would transfer when we moved to another street in the same local area.  Took equipment to their location on Monday.  Guy at counter was extremely rude and behaved as if taking back Comcast's equipment was a huge imposition.  Called on Thursday to verify disconnect of service and they claim no proof of equipment turned in.  Receipt was buried in move, so called twice to request number to contact local office directly.  Once they hung up on me and another time told me there is no way to call them directly - I must drive out to the location.  Receipt was finally located, so I called again to give them the information.  First time, I was put on hold before she even asked my account number and the person never came back to the phone.  Hung up and called again and they tell me I still have to drive to the local office because they cannot verify my receipt over the phone.  Spent my entire lunch hour and the $4 per gallon gas to drive there.  They say it is now turned off, but I cannot call the 1-800 number to verify because they apparently all went to lunch and no one will answer the phones.I am filing this complaint in the hopes that others will see it and choose not to use Comcast.  If they are already involved, I hope they will read this and know to be absolutely certain that Comcast registers the return of equipment.  I would recommend calling the 1-800 number from their parking lot to ensure it is off before leaving the local office.
__label__1 I purchased Comcast's performance internet service. They advertise 25 Mbps. Here are my results from 2 different sites: Comcast site: download speed 8.74Mbps; Upload speed 6.05 Mbps Ookla site: download speed 8.72Mbps; Upload speed 6.06 Mbps. This is with their NEW Modem.
__label__0 When I moved to Jacksonville, Florida for a job, Comcast was the only cable provider. When I signed up, I was not given a modem. Instead, they directed me to a site online where I could order the modem to use. I paid almost $100.00 for the modem. I moved from Jacksonville, Florida in February 2009. Since that time, Comcast has tried to schedule appointments with me twice to pick up the modem that I purchased. They have tried twice now and I informed them not to call me anymore. I wonder how many people have purchased a modem and then give it to Comcast. I believe this is a deliberate scam to acquire free modems to rent to new customers.
__label__1 I'm 31 years old. I was actually around for the advent of the Internet. I remember how slow a 56k dial-up phone modem was, and trust me, Comcast/Xfinity is slower!! On average, I get speeds of no more than 0.4mb/s and my ping is absolutely outrageously horrible!! Furthermore, the Internet cuts out constantly, forcing me out of my games and videos, and I can't stream ANYTHING on it, NOT EVEN YOUTUBE!! Comcast/Xfinity is absolutely the worse thing on the market that a person can buy and what's worse? They're the only Internet provider in my area. There's literally NOBODY else I can go to. If I still had the modem, hookup, and drivers for it, I'd install a 56k modem in a heartbeat and finally enjoy a fast internet service!! This is pure, undiluted, crap!! AVOID COMCAST/XFINITY AT-ALL-COSTS IF YOU CAN!!
__label__5 I had a previous bill with them and they send me to collections - 1400 dollars. I call and I wanted to have a new account, so they promise me to start me up with a 0 balance. They call me and say "yes, 0 balance" 3 times before they then came. I ask again if it was going to be 0 balance, they told me again yes. On the same day of connecting the toll, me: 0 balance. Well when the bill came in it was for $528, so I have call - spend over seven hours on call and now they tell me it was a previous balance that was not paid. I ask them, still no help with this. So why they tell you all this and set you up for failure again?
__label__1 Recently, I got an email from Comcast telling me to follow a few simple steps to update their program. I did that. Suddenly, everything dealing with the internet stopped! After trying everything I could think of, I called a computer tech to come out. After looking everything over, he told me he had been dealing with this same problem for days with lots of customers, and that it resulted from people updating their Comcast program as instructed. After trying everything else, we went to Staples to find a new wireless router, where the sales clerk told us she had been getting the same story from people suddenly having to replace their routers! I am furious! This cost me $130. I don't have to spend! I am very tempted to put this on Facebook but thought its only fair to discuss it with you first!
__label__0 I use the internet for various financial transactions . So far I have managed to work around this poor service and have not lost money, only time. When the comes that it finally does cause me a financial lose, I will take them to court.
__label__0 I signed on for an addition to my service which included BBC America. I have previously enjoyed this channel being a Brit and I had checked out online the contents of this channel. There are lots of Brit comedies, etcetera. To my horror, I got Star Wars, some Kitchen Show, Dr. Who, and nothing else. I did not get what I signed up for! I am so disgusted with Comcast. By tomorrow, I will have this extra service removed. What are you playing at? I have just been paying for crap.
__label__5 I am just so disgusted with Comcast. They are the only cable company in my area and conduct their business just as such. As much as I would like to change companies there is only the option to go with dial up. My account is almost 30 days past due. I just added cable television service 48 hours ago. I called to have an extension on my payment until Friday and they advise me they cant because the account is past due, and that the reconnection fee is only $5.00 if my Internet is turned off. It is ok to increase the monthly charges on a past due account but not schedule extensions to prevent additional charges from being added. This is absolutely crazy, and I really wish there were more option in the area as I would have cancelled them years ago. I requested a formal complaint address, email or number and was given the general toll free line. Who do you petition to allow alternate companies in your neighborhood?
__label__1 I signed up for a 24 month contract, was verbally told that the early termination fee would be cancelled if I moved to an area that wasn't serviced by Comcast. In addition, the service contract is vaguely worded and does not address this issue specifically. I am now moving with 6 months left on my contract to an area without Comcast service, and was told the fee would apply when I cancel. It is unclear how such deceptive business practices can continue. What company still charges for services when services cannot even be provided? It's absurd.
__label__1 Service is terrible... Customer service is terrible. Price is horrible. Billing is never correct... Bill is always incorrect. Often bill for service I do not have or have never agreed to. Trying to get help is impossible. When service is out, which happen often, it is impossible to get credit on your bill. I call customer service to get credit. They will lie and tell you the credit is applied to account. But after months of calling and recalling it is never credited. I don't ever take the time to write a review, but I am so disgusted with Comcast that I made the time to write and inform other people of the poor quality. Please please please do not go with Comcast... You will regret it. The price appear like a good deal at first, but believe me, it will go up sky high. I started off with triple pay bundle for 89.00 dollars a month. Years later my bill for basic cable and slow internet is 198.00 a month. Everybody I know that have Comcast is very unhappy!!!! Enough is enough. Time to go back to the old rabbit ears and cancel service and free myself from all the Comcast drama!!! (and file a report with the Texas Utility Commission and BBB...)
__label__1 Have been a customer of cable for over a year. Recently I moved & added the internet service as a bundled promotion they sold me, which convinced me to cease my internet service with Verizon. Since moving, I have had nothing but incorrect billing charges, mainly being overcharged repeatedly. In addition, I had to wait months for credits because my service was also installed weeks after I moved in and on separate occasions still I finally received cable & internet. The customer service is hit or miss, but clearly there is no fluid system that they are all working from, therefore hours are spent on the phone updating them. I am FURIOUS that a corporation is allowed to treat its customers with complete disrespect. At the same time they have monopolized the area I live in so I am unable to get FIOS.
__label__1 August 21, 2011 (2:30-3PM): I return to my residence to find that my TV (both receivers) were inoperative and an error message appears "Service is temporarily unavailable, channel will be back shortly" (not verbatim, but along those lines). I figured it was something temporary and did not mind the wait (nor did I know how long it has been like this since I was not at my residence for a few hours and it was working before I left). I also attempted to log on to the Internet which was also not available as well.August 21, 2011 (4:29PM): After a few hours, there was still no service so I called Comcast. I used the system to attempt to "refresh" my units and nothing took place. After which, I contact Comcast again to speak to a representative. The first rep. was with the cable portion and attempted to troubleshoot. He was unsuccessful. I informed him I had a modem as well and it was not working. He said he wanted to send me over to the Internet department for that could be the cause of the issue and once that is fixed, the cable should work as well. I accepted.I was transferred to  Nick of the Internet department. Nick went through the "standard" procedure on helping troubleshoot the system. All in all, he stated it seems to be an issue with the outside line and he had to send a technician out to the residence. He placed me on hold to find the "earliest appointment" and returned with "I can have someone out there for you on the 1st". My response in return was "The 1st of what, for I know you are not saying September which will make this 2 weeks of no service". He informed me that was the earliest, or it would not be until September 26th.I proceeded to explain to Nick that this was unacceptable. I can understand 2-3 days, but Comcast wants people to await 2 weeks to regain service -- service that has already been paid for. So in a nutshell, Comcast can take my money with no issue, but cannot render servicesNick then stated he will place this on an "expedite" and I asked him what does that mean, that service will take place between now and September 1st. He explained that someone will be in contact with me within 24 hours on this level.August 22, 2011 (11:06AM): I called Comcast and spoke with a rep. named Ian. I explained to Ian that I was not going to be able to be without service for 2 weeks and have Comcast interfere with my money. I explained to Ian what happened on the day before, he pulled the notes. I said fatuously "You all act like there are no resources available for these service calls", in which I was informed by Ian "Yes Ma'am, it is due to lack of manpower that we are on schedule like this". I mentioned to Ian, "I was truly joking when I said that for all the people out here that need/want jobs, you are telling me that Comcast is not trying to fill those jobs to provide better service."Either way, after a nice discussion, Ian stated he was going to see if he can schedule me for cancellations throughout the day and will call me between calls when he is able to move me up. He did call back one time and moved me from September 1st to August 29th. I thanked him. He said he would continue to see what he can come up with the rest of the day.August 23, 2011 (1:53PM): I called Comcast and spoke with a rep. named Tony. I explained to Tony the same situation that was denoted by Nick and Ian. He reviewed the records and said he will see if he can find a cancellation. Over the duration of our conversation, he was able to move me from August 29th to August 27th. I informed Tony that this was still unacceptable, but thank you for working with me and I will call back to see if there are any other cancellations (since now it seems as though I have to do Comcast job for them and I do not even work for them. I am not able to perform my task for the company I do work for since Comcast does not provide service for those who have paid for it).August 23, 2011 (~5PM): I checked my voice mail to receive a call from Comcast stating my schedule appointment is for Saturday, August 27th.August 23, 2011 (5:08PM / CALL DURATION: 10 mins and 13 secs): I called Comcast and spoke with a rep. named "Marg/Marge" (for this rep. did not take any notes, record the conversation and most likely she was from one of your outsourcing companies -- as I was informed by Cathy/Kathy). I explained to "Marg/Marge" the situation and was calling to see if there were any cancellations available so that I can be placed in that slot. She wanted to know how she could assist, and I informed her once again, I was calling to find out if there were any cancellations so that I might be placed in that slot and moved up to a sooner service date. After going back and forth, I was informed by Marg/Marge that she could actually make an appointment for me for the next day "Wednesday, August 24th" for she "had the authority to schedule this appointment for me." I said, "Really? Is this accurate? No one else had that ability, but this is great and I will take it." She asked me what time slot did I want and I said, "I'm flexible and can make myself available, morning preferably, but I will take what you have." She asked, "What about 8am-9am? " I said "Ok. Great." She then said "No wait, 8am-11am." And I said, "Not a problem, I will be available."I confirmed with Marg/Marge about 2 or 3 times to make sure I heard this correct and to verify. She confirmed. I thanked her and we ended the call.August 23, 2011 (~6PM): I called in from my place of employment to await the schedule appointment I had with Comcast/Xfinity on Wednesday, August 24th from 8AM - 11AM.August 24, 2011 (10:08AM): I called Comcast and spoke with a rep. named Cathy/Kathy and explained that I was to have an appointment today between 8am - 11am. It was 10am and I wanted to confirm I still had an appointment set. After reviewing my account, Cathy/Kathy then informed me that I never had an appointment schedule. I told her about the conversation that took place the evening before with "Marg/Marge" and she placed me on hold and came back informing me that "It seems that I was told this information to get me off the phone and appease me. For there was no schedule made and it would have been impossible for a schedule to be made so soon due to the lack of manpower. And to top it off, this person Marg did not leave any notes or recorded the conversation. I'm trying to track this down but it seems it was one from the outsourcing office that this call came from. "Question to Comcast/Xfinity: Do you all produce individuals who falsely give out information? Is this what you all train your members to do -- to insult a paying customer by appeasing them? This is the foundation and company culture is it? Amazing. What an interesting practice to instill with those members of your organization. I did not ask this Marg/Marge person to lie to me. She could have kept that lie and I did not have to take off work for 4 hours based on this lie and their lying company culture that Comcast/Xfinity creates.Cathy/Kathy attempted to schedule me a sooner appointment with the cancellation of another, but was not able to. I was still schedule for Saturday, August 27th. (Honestly, just like I said, why would I believe she would. Why would I believe anything a Comcast/Xfinity representative states to me since your organization has no issue with having members who lie to customers. )August 25-26, 2011 (various times): I called repeatedly to see if there was a sooner cancellation and representatives informed me there were none.August 27, 2011: After awaiting 6-7 days, my schedule appointment has finally arrive. I received a call from Comcast confirming appointment and per the message: "We show you have a schedule appointment for today between 12PM-2PM and this is our second attempt to make sure that you are home. We will call again prior to sending a technician out to you. Etc." I awaited the call back from Comcast and at 1PM, I decided to call to find out the status. The first person I talked to (1:03PM), who's from oversea since I have asked him, stated my appointment was canceled. I asked him for what reason and he said that Comcast could not confirm I was home. I said I received a call and was told I would get another call. He then proceeded to tell me that he can schedule an appointment for me since this appointment was canceled. I hung up the phone.August 27, 2011 (1:29PM): After realizing this company's respect level to its customers is absolutely not there, I called Comcast back. I was placed with a rep. named Crystal. With a witness present, I had Crystal on speaker and asked her why was my appointment canceled. She said, "Let me check," and when she came back on the phone, she informed me that it was due to Comcast not being able to confirm I was home. I asked her, what number is Comcast calling for I only received 2 calls and that 2nd call stated a 3rd call will be made prior to sending a technician out. Crystal then proceeded to say "We have been calling **. " My first thought was maybe she read it too fast or maybe I heard her wrong. But that is not my number. So, I asked her (in front of my witness) to repeat the number again.  I said "Crystal, whose number are you all calling because that is not my telephone number. You said ** and my number is **. " Crystal looked again and agreed that it was an error in the system and does not know where that digit could have came from.Crystal proceed on reviewing the call and said it seems as though Comcast system was calling that number, called it 3 times then corrected herself and called my number twice, then canceled me. Per my discussion and the voicemail left by Comcast, you all call 3 times before canceling, and I was only contacted twice. Comcast, and its technology, called a different number 3 times and booted my appointment out of the system. Crystal placed me on hold to return after and stated she spoke to her supervisor and also to dispatch and explained to them that Comcast was calling a totally different number not associated to this account. Dispatch informed them they will review and contact me. It was all agreed that Comcast/Xfinity was the cause of calling a wrong number, which lead to my cancellation. Why could I not get a technician out that same day when I was not at fault for Comcast/Xfinity calling a number that is not even associated with my account. My account has only 1 number on it since the start of their service 3 months ago.Crystal told me someone will be in contact. I asked her when was this, and she could not confirm. I asked her if I should call back in a few hours, but she said someone will contact me. To this day, I'm awaiting a call from dispatch.August 27, 2011 (Later that evening): I call Comcast to find out, I have a service appointment schedule for September 6, 2011. Your company is truly amazing. No call back and due to a Comcast error, I have to await another week for service.August 28, 2011 (Started back on my call to see about a cancellation slot): Comcast supposedly moved me to an appointment, September 3rd (7:30am-8:30am).August 29, 2011 (Started back on my call to see about a cancellation slot): Spoke to  Jim who informs me nothing sooner is available and my appointment is set for September 7th. September 7th? When did this change take place? I was initially after Comcast error on Saturday, August 27th scheduled for September 6th, then moved to September 3rd. Now, I have been moved to September 7th and no one has contacted me, informed me or anything. So, when was I suppose to find this out. Oh wait, I know. When I took off of work again on September 3rd, No one shows up. I call to find out it is September 7th. Amazing.August 29, 2011 (Called "Make It Right" Department at 2:38PM): Spoke to Shirley who went through my records, heard everything stated to her and confirmed with the notes she read, supposedly to took knows on her own (I have no way to verify) and stated she was escalating this to the local office. I informed her:3) Comcast organization culture is based on falsifying information, for that is exactly what Marg/Marge did on last Wednesday and Jim did today when he told me that "Comcast never called the wrong number on Saturday" and Shirley confirmed that  Comcast notes show that ** was called 3 times on Saturday.But you know the kicker -- September 12th. Comcast will want their money from me. Comcast will want payment for no service render. So now, I can add to the list that Comcast/Xfinity likes to steal from it customers. Amazing.
__label__0 
__label__0 We had been long time Comcast customers who always paid on time. However, we were traveling overseas and had difficultly getting payments to Comcast. We missed their notices of late payment. When we did pay the amount in full on our return, Comcast had disconnected our services and released our telephone number of 14 years. They could not restore the number for us as it was "out of the pool." 
__label__0 I have called for several months concerning the service to my Cable Service. I thought if I scheduled to add on internet and phone, I would get special attention. My fault, it obviously doesn't mean anything to get more work because I still don't even have anyone trying to help me get someone here to figure out why I don't have any of those services! You would think someone would be backing up these service calls to see why things have not progressed? I have told the service reps what the other ones have said, but no one seems to care as they revert to a note that was put in forever ago. At least one note made it and all I want is cable to come in and that I receive and can hear it without it skipping words and going on and off! Everyone of my TVs do this so it is not just my TV, they are all different brands so that is not it. This has been going on for years. We travel a lot, and when I return from trips I don't have that kind of time to spend hours on a phone to wait for someone to pick up and make an appointment for 2 weeks out because I know I will be leaving again. So when I know I am going to be home, I make the effort and when I finally have the call I started back in Sept., the lady told me they would "refresh" my cable so I had to unplug all my lines to TVs (even the ones behind massive wall furniture, which was insane!) and they would work fine within a few hours. How easy, not!She got to hang up, only for me to have to go through the same routine of getting back on the phone, spending several hours more to finally get someone to speak with and waste another few hours to get the same response and the same requests to do. Who has this kind of time to blow? OK. And it doesn't work again, so now back on and they are going to send someone. I think adding on services will get me more attention. No such luck. Each cable guy has a different excuse of why he can't do anything, but not to worry because he will record a detailed report and the next guy will know exactly what to do. This never happens! Comcast doesn't even have what each one says nor all the different times I have called. I recorded the dates. Now I am taking down names and # of each so I have exact info. If I could have another company for cable I would in a moment, to get these guys out of my house. I hate incompetence. Please let me know if there is any or maybe not have TV at all. I am exhausted with all of this, I have another wasted day of hours on the phone only to hear I need to do it again on Friday (12/17) because they can't do today. I am telling her what the other guy said to do, but she is says it's not recorded so we will probably be repeating this on Friday. How is it that a company so large has this type of disorganization, incompetence and disregard for public service? Why should they care? There is no one to compete against, the market is theirs. They are horrible! Comcast needs a wake up call. Am I the only one that can't get through? Consequences are high blood pressure, marriage under pressure because every 3rd to 5th word doesn't come through, the picture goes on and off, we are not receiving his favorite channel (whatever Morning Joe is on). So come 5:30am, I have to listen to him screaming about how I am not hard enough on the cable people to get this simple job done! The stress of this stupid TV puts everyone in a bad mood! The time I have spent on the phone waiting, I could have made a week's pay by now. Needless to say, the days I have missed work for some joker cable guy come to tell me he can't do the job because he is not equipped and will leave detailed notes for the next guy so he will be ready and then have the next one tell me the same story. Poor service, disorganized communications, and horrific customer service.
__label__1 I have had Comcast for about 8 months now and I have had billing issues ever since I upgraded my services. I called about 4 times a month for the past 4 months and my bill has never been the same. I talk with many reps and they tell me my bill would be 132.00 a month including installation and every month it has been 353.00 then 265.00 to 217.00 per month. I called each time I receive a notification to my phone and an adjustment is made and I pay the balance and the next month they charge me for the difference of what my charge was. Now my last bill is 172.00 and I'm finish with my installments and now they state they don't have any documentation, that my installation was cut in half. So I have to continue to make installment payments for the original price and I am tired of the fluctuation in billing and all they can say is that its policy. I refuse to keep this service... They are beyond the worst!
__label__1 We had our service transferred from one address to another. Comcast failed to bring the billing info over to the new account. We contacted them to discuss the fact that they were charging us $200 in "Non-Returned" equipment (which was used at the new house and installed by their technician (an additional $200 for the "installation" when everything was already set up from the previous tenants). They still did not set up the new account with the auto payments so they turned the service off. We decided to go with a different provider because of the incompetence and because after we moved, the internet was so slow at the new address that we couldn't stream anything because of "Buffering".1 week AFTER they turn our service off, they hit my debit card $327+ (even though they "had no card on file" for the new address) which in turn overdrew my account. I called to speak to someone about this and was told by the lady that she had to transfer me to "Billing". I have now been on hold for the Billing department for over 30 minutes (no kidding, my phone says 31.10 and I still keep having to listen to the elevator music and hear their recording stating that my call is important to them and asking me to please continue to hold and a representative will be with me shortly).This is just how important we consumers are to Xfinity/Comcast. They mess up not just once but twice (by not transferring all the details from one location to the new location and by not fixing it when we called about the "Unreturned Equipment" that they "installed" at our new place). Now for the third time I am trying to get things straightened out and I have now been on hold for 36 min and 31 sec. Horrid Customer Service, Horrid Experience!! It is now at 42:31 minutes and still on hold!!!!
__label__1 I went to have internet service installed. I am deaf (Military incident) and cannot converse over the phone. I paid Comcast slightly over $100.00 and received a do-it yourself package in shrink wrap. At the designated time I was at my address waiting for installation. Two Comcast trucks showed up. I had the red Comcast bag with the equipment sitting on the hood. They passed within 10 feet. Five hours later they were still doing??? I walked up to one of them and pointed to my truck with the Comcast bag and asked what I could do to help. I got blank looks and later they just drove off. I took my receipt to the Comcast store and asked why I did not get installation. I was told "They (meaning someone in that same store in customer service) "should never have sold you that package."We will need to charge you an extra $70.00 for the installation. I replied  "all I need is the cable feed." FCC regulations will not allow us to do that. I knew that to be untrue. I went home, gathered up the bag and equipment still in shrink wrap. I received a returned equipment receipt. It has been three weeks and I have not yet received my money back. I took the receipt in yesterday. I still do not have my money back. At this point I suspect they have violated the American Disabilities Act. My ticket number is ** for the visit on 11/17/2014 at 2:19 p.m. The receipt for the returned equipment is ** on 10/30/14 10:32 a.m. cashier **.
__label__0 Lowell Cable TV sold to Comcast. This was supposed to be a great deal for the Lowell customers. It has been nothing but a nightmare. They state they are upgrading and need to do a modem swap for our high speed internet. Three appointments were made by THEM and then cancelled by THEM. For one of these appointments, I had someone come to my house. They had no idea the appointment was cancelled, so they waited for nothing. Finally the swap occurred - but that's all it was. WE had to hook up the new modem! Now I get a bill that's so cockeyed, it looks like they are re-billing me for December, which I already paid! I have been trying for 1 1/2 weeks to get to their customer service, to no avail. Each time I end up on hold anywhere from 30-45 minutes. Tonight, I waited over 2 hours and still never got a rep on the line. Tonight I sent 2 e-mails and demanded a call - we'll see what happens. I'm beginning to think that when a call comes in, it just gets put into a holding pool that nobody ever answers. I call at all different times of the day and night, hoping I will get through, but to no avail.I have a life and cannot spend it all on hold with Comcast. Their internet chat is no help - 3 different times I was told they could not access my account and were transferring the chat to somebody else. Nobody ever came back. I am frustrated but have nobody to talk to about it since they don't answer calls. I have a bill that I feel is wrong but is due soon, and I am afraid I will not get this straightened out ever. I cannot spend my day at work on hold with Comcast nor can I spend my time at home on hold with Comcast.
__label__5 My family tried out a number of ISPs before finally settling on FiOS and loving it. I've never had to deal with Comcast though until I moved to Pennsylvania, and sometimes the crappy internet out here is enough to make me want to move back home. I live with roommates and we split all our bills, so unfortunately (or fortunately, as it were) I am not the account holder for Comcast. But sometimes I wish I were so I could call them and give them a piece of my mind about their awful service. The entirety of last year, the service would randomly drop out for hours. There was no pattern to the drop outs - sunny, rainy, you name it. You would randomly lose service at some point in the day. I would be in the middle of an assignment or project and find myself suddenly disconnected, with no access to some of my class texts that were only available online! The only way to get it back would be to reboot the modem, which worked about half the time, and you would have to do this several times a day. My roommate called several times about the constant outages and after the usual "did you restart the modem?" song and dance was promised that someone would come by and look at the line. No one ever showed up.When an opportunity came to switch providers we jumped on it, only to discover that there are no other reasonable choices in the area (Verizon DSL and home phone is required? Really?). We bit the bullet and upgraded to Xfinity, which is supposed to be better than the lowest tier package we had before. We still get inexplicable outages for no rhyme or reason. I still have to reset the modem several times a week. What exactly does my money go to if the internet doesn't even work? I can't wait for the time when I can choose my own service provider.
__label__1 Since December 30, 2011 I have been trying to get back my internet service with no success. It is now January 4, 2012 and still no service. The customer service is very, very bad. They switch me from department to department, and nobody can solve it. It is very frustrating.
__label__1 I have their 105mb Blast internet and the 60 channel line-up plus HBO and Streampix. I have been having nothing but problems with inconsistent internet speeds and I lost 6 channels that I was supposed to have because they didn't want to correct their error. Instead when I proved to them that I was supposed to have these channels they changed what my line-up showed as on my account overview. Now, just to state this...I actually did not originally want TV through them. I had just the 105mb internet but when I sent in for a new router/modem they sent me a cable box along with it. I called, they gave me some deductions for their error and then offered me the deal I currently have. They told me it would be $89/month. Well, my first bill after the deductions they pushed through was $50. My second bill is now $137. Basically they are making me pay for the deductions. This company has done nothing but rip people off for years. Oh but on top of all of the mistakes they have made and the horrible billing...I have had to deal with some people through tech support that didn't even know what they were talking about along with others who were pure attitude and even swore over the phone. I am NOT happy with their service, I am NOT happy with their employees and I am NOT happy about their billing. If I could cancel without ensuing terrible fees or at least downgrade back to my standard internet I would. I am even getting charged for the old router/modem when I sent it back! I am nothing but perturbed!
__label__1 I closed my Comcast account on June 19, 2015, and was promised a $50.00 refund check, representing the deposit I paid. I received a partial refund check of $34.75 and contacted Comcast on July 17, 2015, to request the remaining deposit amount of $15.25, which Comcast agreed to provide in 2 weeks. When I didn't receive the $15.25 refund check by August 13, 2015, I contacted Comcast and was promised a refund check in 3-4 weeks. When I didn't receive the $15.25 refund check, I contacted Comcast on September 14, 2015. They could not tell me why the refund check had not yet been sent and instructed me to go to my closest Comcast store to pick up my refund check. When I requested my refund at the Comcast store, the representative advised me that the store did not provide refunds. He stated that he did not know why a Comcast representative would send me there.He indicated that he could see a refund request but there was no credit due on the account, so no check would be cut. He proceeded apply a $15.25 credit to the account and explained that this would initiate a refund check that I should receive in 3-4 weeks. I contacted Comcast to complain that I had been given the run around and they promised that I would receive a refund check within one week. I figured I was still just getting the run around so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor apologized for my inconvenience and stated that I would receive a check in 3-4 weeks, not one week. I hope that I will receive the $15.25 refund within the stated timeframe (probably October 5, 2015).But I felt compelled to report Comcast's lack of service, delay in payments, and the inconsistent and misleading statements. I believe that if I owed Comcast money, they would not simply let me apologize and not provide payment. In fact, I would most likely be reported to the credit reporting agencies for lack of payment. But in this case, Comcast owes money to me and has not provided me with the full amount. They have simply offered apologies. I have had my time wasted and have not had use of my funds during this delay. I believe sites like this one allow consumers to report on a company's bad behavior, just as the company would report a consumer's bad payment history to the credit reporting agencies.
__label__0 To sum it all up, we have been having nothing but problems since July of this year. Our service was temporarily disconnected due to non payment in mid July. At the end of July we called to settle our bill and to sign up for the new Triple Play package since it will be cheaper. At that time we owed a little more than $500. We were told to only pay $370 of that since the balance was to be pro-rated for the services we had not used since our cable was disconnected. In essence, the remaining balance would be wiped clean since it was an advance billing for services that we were canceling and changing to the Triple Play package. In August is when all the problems started. Not only did it take 5 technicians numerous attempts to properly wire my new service, one of them leaving an estimated 2ft by 2ft hole in my ceiling that was not fixed in a timely manner, but to my astonishment when I opened my Comcast bill the following September, the balance had not in fact been wiped clean, they were charging me for having the Triple Play package PLUS my old service, also the charges for all the botched attempts to wire my service that were supposed to have been refunded were also there on my bill. Numerous phone calls and attempts to settle the issue were finally addressed when I was told to only pay $138 and that a dispute would be filed within the company and a research department would correct the issue. I paid it. Then in October, I try to make an outgoing phone call and I cannot. My service had once again been disconnected due to non-payment. At that time my bill was almost $1,000! Many, many, many phone calls had been made to Comcast about the issue. Supervisors tell me that I will get a call back, and they never call... and that's if they even listen to me. Sometimes I would just call and they would tell me that there was nothing wrong with my billing and try to get me to pay the full amount due. 
__label__0    I was transferring my service from Weston Florida to Hollywood Florida I scheduled the appointment online 2 weeks in advance was told I would be able to keep same boxes they would just reprogram. so Friday the 30th I wait between 8-11 and noone shows Up I call and they say the tech left a door tag no door tag. I fight with them they set up an appointment for Halloween between 11-2 at 2pm on the dot the tech arrives we walk through i explain what we need he doesn't have my basic Digital boxes so I have to pick them up at a locations if I want them mind you Im transferring service same amount of boxes etc. then he ask me if I have a drill cause he didn't bring his I of course allow him to borrow my drill. then he ask me if I know where a home depot is cause he doesn't have a drill bit. so we both leave me to get the boxes him to get tools. I am of course giving a problem at comcast center cause they are 2 different accounts until the tech calls boxes in or some bs. anyways i get back to the house the tech is hooking everything up 4.5 hrs pass he has to go up on pole finds the tap in on the pole is broken so he calls his service center which informs him to call the line supervisor darryl which tells him to unhook someone else from tap and hook me in so he can close the call that the neighbor that loses cable will call in and they will eventually send a line team out please remember I wasnt on phone this is just what the tech told me. after that the supervisor calls back and tells him to forget the first idea and just split from the tap in with a splitter. so we then go back inside where my modem and one basic digital box isnt working and he doesnt know why so he tells me monday I can go get these replaced and then hook them up and everything should be working fine. monday i go to center and they wont give me modem a tech needs to come out after fighting 3 days later a tech comes out and gets my cable hooked up. when the first tech left I had a cable wire hanging down below 4 feet in my backyard. everyone I talk to says sorry and they will be calling me back still nothing. so 2 days ago on my flat screen i started to see a greenish purple line scrolling through tv I thought it was my tv going bad so i bought a new one come to find out its the cable maybe its cause a pole team still hasnt come out and my service isnt really working but trying to get some answers is like getting wisdom teeth pulled. and Im getting false bills for the install charging me for 6 outlets when tech only put in 4 but also i didnt get paperwork that day.

__label__0 Why does the service shut off and then eventually come back on? This has been going on for weeks. I haven't watched a complete TV program. I have noticed it more frequently since the digital change over. Whats going on? Whenever/if I call the techs, they want to send somebody out and then want to charge me for it. Then, if that's not enough, if you go through the same process again, next week you get tagged again for the charges. Why? When can I get a break and get something for my having to put up with this kind of service? Damn, I nearly have to rent any movies if I want to see the complete show. You miss bits and pieces of a program and you can understand whats going on. When are you going to resolve the problems?
__label__1 The new required DTA device was operational and required me to call Comcast 4 times as well as spend 3 hours of my time. Comcast cannot send someone until Jan. 22, 2012 which is an entire week with a non functioning TV and VCR. So I called a private repairman and had to pay him. Now I have learned that the VCR cannot be used to record a show if you are watching a different show! Comcast is a miserable company. Unfortunately my association picked them and I am locked in. The consequences are 3 hours of my time and money paid to private repairman and lots of aggravation!
__label__1 I have Xfinity from Comcast. Every few months the price goes up. I've complained to them before about this and they lower the price but try to give a new contract for 2 years, then in a few months the price goes up again. I'm talking about the price going from $119 per month to $145 per month. I'm sure this is illegal and I'm disgusted with this dishonest company. I will also be reporting this to the better business bureau!
__label__1 I had internet and home security installed a few months ago. I was not told that I had a data limit. When I discovered I had a limit I was told I could check my usage online. This was false. I cannot get anything but an error message telling me my equipment cannot be loaded. I tried 3 times to get help. The last time I was told I would have to call for my data usage. After I got finished speaking to tech support my home alarm started going off. Xfinity says it is not going off. I can only assume I am being punished for having an issue. I would not suggest Xfinity Home or Comcast internet to anyone. The customer support is an overseas call center that bounces you from one person to the next and they never solve the problem. I am now stuck in a 2 year contract with internet I can't use for fear of incurring fees and a home alarm that keeps going off.
__label__1 Worst customer service I have ever come across. I will be urging all friends and family to disconnect their service immediately. I was charge for renting a modem that I did not have (used purchased modem). 3yrs and 1 month equating to over $300 and they would not budge on reimbursing more than $80. They are stealing $220 from me. I will get in contact with the Better Business Bureau and a lawyer to recuperate my lost $$.
__label__0 I scheduled service to have an additional cable line installed into another room in my house.  The initial date of this service was 10/3/08.  No one showed and I was only notified an hour past the scheduled window that they were running late.  Being that I had other engagements and had already waited all afternoon, I was forced to reschedule this service.  My closest consolation was for a month later on 11/11/08.  Again, no one showed and I was called well after the window. The third appointment was set for 12/11/08.  I was told in advance that if they did not show up an hour into the windowed time, to call.  And, since they didn't show up after an hour (no surprise), I called. No one at Comcast could get a straight answer and no dispatcher could be reached as to the whereabouts of my installer.  I spent over half an hour on the phone during this call, much of which was spent on hold.  I was informed that the guy would be there in his remaining 30 minutes scheduled.  So, as you might expect the timeframe again expired and no one showed or called.  I called back, was put on hold for 12 minutes until finally someone called me on the other line from Comcast saying the guy was here.  Miraculously, he pulled up about 30 minutes past the window and finally installed the cable. ...after installing the cable box in my room, he informed that it takes 20 minutes for the box to automatically program in all the channels and that, after that time, all channels would come in.  They never did. I called Comcast again, was put on hold for 15-20 minutes (with one hangup by them in between) and was put on with some doofus that said they weren't receiving a signal from my box and couldn't help me presently.  So this required setting up yet another date on 12/15/08 to have a technician come out and look at the problem in person. So, it will be 4 scheduled appointments, 2 no-shows, 1 late arrival and hours of being put on hold just to get cable installed and working properly (hopefully) in my room.Numerous lost hours of work and pay to wait around for false appointments, long useless phone calls, added stress, frustration, and complete hatred of this company.
__label__5 In February, after 6 months of our "bundle" bill going up each month, we called Comcast. The bill had reached $182 a month! My husband took great notes on everything. They offered us $139 a month for the first year and $159 the second year. We asked for a contract but they said they don't do that. Since then, each month, the bill has gone up. This month we reached $152. My husband called them and spoke with a supervisor who said they didn't care about our business and there was nothing he could do. He could not explain the extra charges. My husband asked how they could change the contract and he wouldn't answer the question. My husband then did a computer chat with customer service and felt much better. The man said there was a mistake and we would receive a call within 24-48 hours to correct it. That was four days ago and we have not received a call.
__label__1 Comcast -- so Cocky now they don't even fear FCC nor U.S. Senators! Intermittent service year after year -- every month -- every week and sometimes daily! for approximately 4years -- it's no longer trivial.I even resorted to telling Comcast that Houstonians should petition and complain to FCC and Texas senators. Comcast basically laughed and said go ahead --they would help me with information! (very cocky). Comcast knows they wield endless power now & are completely untouchable and unafraid to even the FCC!
__label__0 Since November 07' I have had nothing but problems with my service. After about 20 phone calls in december with no luck I decided to take my box to manahawkin to exchange. I was given a new one.two weeks later my box stopped working so they sent someone out to 'fix the lines' they told me there was nothing wrong with my lines it was the box so they replaced. two wekks later my box was not working again, so they sent some one out again to 'fix the lines. they replaced to box again and checked the signals and said there was nothing wrong with lines it was the 'new box and replaced again. the again a week later someone had to come again to 'replace the box! this was in january 08, numerous amounts of phone calls and I asked them if I could be credited at least something and they said no but maybe 40.00 that is a joke considering my bill is about 100.00 a month!! now here it is march 8 and I awoke to noe cable and no internet again! I called for three hours and finally got thru and they said someone would be out from 12 to 4 today. they never came. so at 5 I called and they said no one can come until tuesday the 11th and that no one should of told me that. so when I asked for a supervisor she (camille hung up on me) so once again I called back to get a supervisor and was told now there were outages in my area,even though all my neighbors had service but me! 
__label__1 This company has the worst customer service!!!! Unfortunately, the first young lady I spoke to did not provide me her name - before hanging up on me!!! I called in again and a representative by the name of Kandice ** told me that I could either take a call back or wait on the line for an hour to speak with a manager!!! What kind of company tells a customer they have to wait on the line for an hour to speak to a manager????? I waited for a total of 30 minutes before hanging up. I'm currently in the market for a new cable/internet/security provider!!
__label__1 Been paying 44.00 per month for telephone service that I didn't need because we have cell phones. I was told four yrs ago I had to pay in order to have internet. Called today 1800 - Comcast lady told me no, I did not have to pay for telephone service to have it; so upset, this cost a lot of money.
__label__1 I opened a restaurant in Saugatuck, MI this summer. When opening, I called Comcast business to check out rates. I tried to watch my expenses and was hesitant because I didn't "need" internet and phone. I thought it might be a good idea, but wasn't sure I would be in that location for more than the 11 month lease I signed. The package with Comcast was for a 2-year contract. I told my rep that I needed to think about it due to the reasons stated above. The customer rep then went into high pressure sales mode. He then told me that if I needed to cancel my service (due to business closing) that I could have an attorney write and my contract would end. Seeing that I have three attorneys who are cousins, and a couple more within the family, I figured it was safe! After being open 6 months, I ended up selling my space (as allowed with my zoning, and commercial real estate lease) and will take about 6 months to a year before reopening another location. I called Comcast to inform them I would be sending an attorney form, and was met with thug like behavior from the customer service rep. He informed me the last couple months, policy had been changed and that I would have to pay an 1100 disconnect fee?!? I told him that the salesperson promised me over 5 times that this was not the situation. I feel as if I was dealing with the mafia (not joking!). I asked to speak to his supervisor (which he tried to avoid). I then go to the supervisor. Initially, he told me Comcast has never had that in place (sending in attorney letter to discontinue without cancellation fee) then after I said,  "That is funny. Your rep just told me that was the policy and that you just changed it. Again, thug behavior just threatening me. So, I went into tea party mode and let him know that I was not a manipulator, I did not try to take from the system, that I am totally capitalist and am not trying to "take" from Comcast. I stated that the only reason for me signing on was because of that guarantee. He then went on to tell me if I found someone to take over my service he would let me out of contract. So, now to avoid 1100 in fees, I have to try to find an individual to take over my service. I would have zero problem with this (just like my cell phone contract) but that was not what I agreed to? How can a company do this? They do not have this policy for home service, just business. By the way, at the end of the phone call the supervisor said, "Elizabeth, I totally believe you." Your sales rep lied to get you to sign on and I am writing to him telling him not to do that again. He said I use to work in sales and that happens (not word for word but sentiments! ) I am looking to transfer account, if I can't I guess I am filing in small claims court.
__label__1 They are doing what at&t did a few years back. They promised to reverse charges for something an special ed child did and never did it and sat there and said they did. Such bull. I am thinking of going to at&t and maybe not ever come back. They need to fix the charges they promised to fix. Going around in circles with the representative and finally admit they are not going to do it after saying they would. More or less beating around the bush!!!
__label__1 I was a relatively happy Comcast Business Internet customer for several years. I am a physician who is also an IT executive who works out of my home. We built a new house and discovered that Comcast did not offer service at the new location. When we attempted to disconnect the service they would not do anything without my account number. We were on e-billing and the account number was not included in the billing notice. All of our business paperwork was packed and in transit so not available. I spoke with at least 6 different CSRs over a two month period in which several things were promised but not followed up on; sending a paper bill (promised on 3 occasions) which would include the acct. number; a supervisor would call (on 4 occasions, only the last time did it occur); and I was to be transferred to a higher authority and call dropped 3 times. Finally in late January, a sympathetic CSR (many were not, some were concerned but didn't know what to do) took the time to directly contact a supervisor who could help with the disconnect and who finally sent me the documentation for a Voluntary Disconnect that included my account number (this process took approximately 45 minutes to accomplish, but a mere pittance compared to the approximately 5 hours I had spent to this point). I filled out the form immediately and returned it. Now, 2 months later I am still receiving bills for service that was no longer being used for 4 months. I was informed that it takes 60 days to perform a disconnect.I am willing to pay the 2 months of fees, starting in November, if that is what my contract calls for. However, I am not willing to pay for 4 months. In addition, my time is too valuable to have to spend this much time for ANY business related service. I have heard horrid reviews of poor service by Comcast but never in my life would I have anticipated that shutting off my internet would be this difficult, and expensive.
__label__0 With Comcast I cannot receive most of my phone calls, my internet connection is half of what it should be, I am not receiving some of my emails, and I am being over billed. Comcast can't find the problem. They say is on my end, but a technician could NOT find a problem here. I had to call them a week later to find out what was going on. They continue to say that there isn't a problem, or it is on my end. HELP!I've lost money, been stressed, and suffer a migraine requiring a doctor visit.
__label__1 I've had Comcast internet for years because of their high speeds and never had much problem with it. In June I decided to include their TV as part of a bundle. Since that time I have had many problems with the service, especially related to pausing or rewinding live TV. Someone in the household may need my help for a few minutes or UPS might ring the doorbell to deliver the package. When I return to the TV and try to rewind the last 3-5 minutes the service often freezes - I can no longer watch ANYTHING! So now, not only am I missing the 3-5 minutes but I am also missing the rest of my program! I will then call Comcast and they will try to reset the services. After about 20 minutes on the phone with Comcast they will reset my equipment to get it to work again. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't (am not able to pause or rewind live tv), but in most cases I can at least watch TV again.This happens at least 3 times a week since the beginning of September. I decided to call Comcast to try to get out of my contract since it is too frustrating! They appear to be having technical problems with their equipment today so they (accidentally, I hope) disconnected me just when I was about to talk to who I hoped was the 'right person'. My experience with Comcast is just too frustrating. I lose at least 2-3 hours per week and miss at least 2-3 shows each week that I was in the middle of watching. This is ridiculous! They've had technicians come to my home at least twice to try to correct this problem, but to no avail.Comcast customer service is nonexistent. I would give them ZERO out of TEN stars if I could. Their problems are systemic so, where I once agreed to have a callback to answer questions about their customer service I no longer do that because it doesn't lead anywhere. The Reps are mostly nice and competent, but their infrastructure and policies are so backwards that the Reps can't save the day. They only want to know about the interactions with the Reps but they are limited to what they can actually affect.I want to be let out of my two year contract and go back to U-verse for television. It bundles Internet, Phone, and TV when I transfer my service to them in June. I do not want to have to pay a penalty since it is Comcast's very poor service that is causing me to have to change. At this moment, something happened and I cannot watch ANY TV. I'm on hold with Comcast now, waiting for someone who I hope can fix my immediate problem, and also re-fix the ongoing problem of not being able to rewind/pause live tv.
__label__0 When I queried about a newer box, I was told that it was too expensive for Comcast to upgrade to newer boxes. You would think that with all the new HD TVs being sold, that they would have newer boxes with the HDMI connections. With HDMI you have 1 small cable connection instead of the very heavy component cable that they supplied me. It weighs so much that it keeps pulling the connectors out. I was also told that what I have is sufficient. So, I guess that having a monopoly means you don't have to give the customers anything good or up to date, but just what is sufficient.I have all new equipment in my entertainment center which is my living room. The room that is viewable by most visitors/guests. With Comcast all I get is a very used looking HD cable box to display with all my nice attractive looking TV and equipment. Also, I can not use the current HD connections (HDMI). I have lost time away from work using up vacation days. I have had a loss of service each time the boxes fail, but I have had no reimbursment. When this box fails, my next time off from work will be to watch the technicians hook up a satallite dish.
__label__1 Since the x1 was installed problems started with my recording being lost, shows being only partially recorded on demand. Next day only gave me the same shortened recording. It was extremely slow to respond, so I complained to Comcast and they sent the techs out. When they arrived they tried to do their job for over 2 hours and numerous phone calls back to Comcast. They told me it could not be fixed, that it was a national problem and they were working on it and it should be resolved soon. Nine months later it still does not work and Comcast told me on many occasions to be patient, keep paying my bill and they would give me a credit when it was fixed. Well it still does not work and after doing what they asked, I called back again and told in all good conscience it was unfair to keep paying for service that was not working. They suspended all services after two months, told me I could not get another provider until the past due amount was paid, only make outgoing calls to them and 911. They did tell me I could disconnect service and get a new phone service if I bought new equipment from them and they would import my phone # to the new phone provider. I did that. The associate at Verizon did the switch and said it was all set. When I returned home I attempted to make an outgoing call and received the message from Comcast that the line was suspended. Deeply frustrated and do not know what to do.
__label__1 In June of 2013, I opened an internet account without a deposit required. After they checked in their system, the service was up and running without a hitch. In October when I went to the apartment I found a note from Comcast saying that they need the equipment from the prior tenant, I as a good Samaritan, dropped off all the equipment in the Lake Worth, Florida location with the slip they left the next day after I arrived at the apt. When I go to the apt the internet and TV was working just fine. After I dropped off the equipment in the Comcast box, some individual at the Comcast desk, was probably too lazy to investigate and credit the correct account, I believe they just saw the address and went in the system and disconnected my service by mistake. The next day when I woke up there was no service, I called to complain that I have no service, customer service did not want to listen to my complaints, they directed me to a support service where they asked me to pay $39.99 before they can fix my problem. I refused to pay and therefore left without using the service, mind you, I paid for the service that I could not use. That person that canceled my service by mistake cost me $50.00 + tax to reinstate my account for their mistake. I called the customer service to explain to them what I believe happen... They would not listen, the supervisor was even worse than the customer care individual. She gave me a complaint #, but that did not help. To get the service I had to pay $63.12 money down the drain, and filling the pockets for the rich company... I will continue to pursue this as I was ripped off...
__label__0 We recently moved out of Maryland to a new state. When we turned in our cable boxes/converters/remotes, we discovered that one digital convert had inadvertently been packed by the movers with our household goods. To make matters worse, the converter was on a small television in our finished basement, and since we are renting for six months while we sell our house in MD and buy a new home, that piece of equipment is located in one of about 200 boxes in long-term storage. We explained the situation to the Comcast rep who told us that we had 60 days to return it or we would be billed $50. Sign, another unforeseen moving expenditure. We asked the rep whether we should pay right then or wait for the bill and she said Comcast would send a bill.Less than 30 days later, Comcast did indeed send us a bill for $50 to cover the (still) missing digital converter. The bill was dated June 7th and had a due date of June 28th. It was forwarded from our home address but we received it on June 13th. My wife wrote a check and sent the payment into Comcast. Yesterday (June 29th) we received a letter from a collection agency for the $50 payment even though our bank shows that Comcast cashed our check on June 23rd. My wife called Comcast this morning and asked to speak with a manager. Comcast received the $50 payment on 6/23/2011. The bill from Comcast wasn't due until 6/28/2011. The letter from the collection agency was dated 6/23/2011. After being on the phone with Comcast for over 1/2 hour asking for a manager, she was transferred to Tracy (team lead), who claimed she was the person in charge. After explaining about the collection letter, Tracy said to my wife that Comcast "sends the bill to the customer and notifies the collection agency the same day".  Even though the Comcast bill to the customer has a due date of three weeks later. Excuse me? Comcast notifies a collection agency "the same day" that the bill is sent to the consumer? This constitutes consumer credit fraud by (falsely) claiming non-payment on a bill the consumer has not even received yet. 
__label__1 After troubleshooting on the phone for an hour it was determined the receiver box was bad. Took it to the Murfreesboro office and exchanged for a new box. They took the new remote out-of-the-box and told me to use my old remote. Took the box home, hooked it up and worked with troubleshooting for over an hour to get their remote working. It was determined the old remote was not compatible with the new box. Told them to bring me a new remote because they would not give it to me at the office. Charged me $50 on my bill for bringing out the remote. Called customer service and they said the old remote was compatible with the new box and they had to charge me for bringing it out that I could have gone to the office again to correct their mistake. Would only credit my bill $25 instead of 50 they charged me. It was their mistake!
__label__1 We bought a small business. It is primary wholesale and our customers need to reach us by phone daily. The previous owners used Comcast, and I set forth to do the same. I asked to retain the same phone number but obtain a new account number. The salesman on 4.22.14 said no problem.... that was the first lie. Here we are now on 5.27 with interrupted phone service as Comcast "accidentally" turned off the old # instead of porting it to our new equipment. The helpless center said they could have someone turn it back on no earlier than 6.4. What are we supposed to do in the meantime, lose our business? Further, even Comcast couldn't reach us to tell us a tech couldn't show up over Memorial day weekend... Why? Because our phones don't work... and they weren't smart enough to call the cell phone alternatives we have attached to our account. We will undoubtedly suffer huge financial loss while they figure out how to get their act together. We have already spent countless hours on the phone rehashing our story daily. They have not even offered reimbursement of services. This is the most ridiculous excuse for customer service. They should not be allowed to provide service to businesses.
__label__5 I was in shock when I was greeted as soon as I entered. Not even 10 minutes waiting, I was called by my name and greeted again by Ms. ** at 9950 NW 6ct, Pembroke Pines, Fl. I felt important and appreciated and I was completely satisfied. This never happened before in the years I have been coming to Comcast. And for me to write a review means it was worth it. Thank you (Comcast employees) for making my day beautifully.
__label__1 There are not enough words to express how dissatisfied I am with Comcast and their lack of service. Monday morning (12/14/2015) a gentleman came out to set up a new modem that my job had previously arranged for work at home purposes. The technician was very nice and professional. Know that the low rating is not due to the technician that came out, but for the manner in which Comcast conducts business.12/14/2015 I noticed that the cable panel box that the technician had to access in my bedroom closet was never put back together (it is still not together as I type this review). The cable wires were out and panel needs to be screwed back. I didn't want to touch this myself not knowing if any cables need to be hooked to anything specific. Called my apartment complex to see if maintenance could do it and I was instructed to contact Comcast. I thought this would be easy enough - honest mistake and they can have someone come out to get my wires, etc back to being in order. Agent told me on the phone Monday by me calling after 6 (around 6:15/6:30 when I called) that they would have someone out 1st thing the next day. Because it is considered a hazard he stated that he was going to put in an escalation ticket.12/15/2015 - I did not hear from Comcast or a technician as to a time, so I contacted Comcast around noon. The agent that I spoke with stated that someone would be out around 6 p.m. Well, no one called or showed up yesterday evening. I contacted Comcast again around 6:30 cst. I explained to the agent what happened and that I need someone out in the morning. He told me that the system will only let him put the visit down for Friday the 18th, but that he was putting a note in the system for a supervisor to contact me 1st thing the next morning (12/16) to get that appointment taken care of today, 12/16. I was not going to trust that considering the broken promises Comcast previously gave me.I spoke with an agent this morning (12/16) who put in another escalation ticket and I was to receive a call within an hour. After it being almost 2 hours hearing from no one again, I called Comcast again and asked for a Supervisor. The supervisor that I spoke with stated that she could not request for someone to come out today. She had to see the next available time which would be Friday, 12/18/2015. So - basically it seems a supervisor cannot do any more than the actual agents. For this matter to be deemed a hazard by Comcast and to have been escalated you would think Comcast would have someone here asap to place the wires that go in the panel back like they should be and to then close off the panel in the manner in which it should be. Instead - it is now Wednesday & I still exposed cable wires and whatever else is inside of that panel.The people at the top really need to look at how this company is being ran. A little common sense goes a long way. This matter could have been resolved quick & smooth. There was an honest mistake made by the person who came out on Monday. Comcast should have apologized for the matter and from there, thought outside of the box and made a special appointment to rectify a situation that was not my fault. Instead they have me, the customer, continuously call to try and get this taken care of. Not once have I received a call from a supervisor. 12/16/2015 - still waiting for someone to find it important enough to have a technician come out and fix the issue of exposed wires and panel that needs to be screwed back.
__label__1 On 6/8/14, the service for Comcast at my former address was disconnected at my request. Comcast proceeded to charge me for service not used on 6/21/14. On 6/13/14, I had requested to transfer service to my current address. On 6/16/14, I contacted customer service via chat about a charge. I've seen $189 charge on my account. The customer rep informed me that a converter box was still missing. I contacted my brother at the Inkster address, and told my brother what the rep stated. He stated that Comcast came to the house and collected all the converter boxes and other equipment. Today, I called Comcast to once again request service for my new address, and that my brother stated the equipment was picked up. The representative informed me that the equipment was picked up and the charge was due to an outstanding bill. For about 45 minutes, I was placed on hold repeatedly. At first, the representative informed me that there was a misplaced payment on my account, that someone with a different account had their payment placed on my account. Then, I asked for the EXACT date for the charge, the representative stated it was from 5/4-6/4/14. My brother had paid for the amount of $178 on 6/9/14 via credit card. I want Comcast to stop double-billing me for an amount that was billed AFTER I had the service disconnected.
__label__1 I have been a customer for more than 5 years. I recently transferred my services to a different address and asked Comcast to send a tech in to install some wiring due to the fact that the current cable wires are not enough and do not reach my boxes for cable or internet. Comcast scheduled someone to come in a week after I called to make that transfer. No one showed up, no one called and of course Comcast has no way of contacting anyone that can do anything about it. All they do is elevate it to dispatch and they will call back... or so the say. I'm still waiting for that call. After many failed attempts I had to set another appointment 5 days after. The person showed up but according to them, they were there to fix internet troubles, not to do any kind of installation and they could not change the order because it was Sunday and could not contact the company. The person that came was very rude and hostile. Immediately I called Comcast and filed a complaint about the tech and about the appointment. I was told to contact a different number, the place that does the transfers. I called. Apparently since the services had been transferred, the ones that have to do the wiring is the regular company. I called them back, asked to speak to a supervisor. I was discretely declined to speak to a supervisor and the person said they would instead escalate the call to dispatch. I was given a ticket number and a time to expect that call... Nothing..Once again I call back and demand to speak to a supervisor. Someone rudely comes to the phone and says all they can do is elevate the problem so dispatch can call me. So basically, no one can do anything but elevate for dispatch to call me. Dispatch never calls, so it's an vicious cycle. Over two weeks have passed and I am still unable to connect my boxes to get my service. I am expected to pay my first bill very soon and my issue is far from being resolved. All I need is someone to come in and add some wires. Thank you Comcast. I hope your company just fails miserably and all your top executives lead a miserable life to pay for your inadequate "service".
__label__1 Last week, Friday, I set up services to have at my place residence. Just to make sure there is no deposit, I called and spoke with 3 different people and they seem to be not aware of the package deal that I have already set up and about to finalize it. Each person was incompetent of not locating the package and was unable to properly navigate the same website, to which I have navigated to get the package deal. Being frustrated by this, I just finalized the package deal and scheduled my appointment for May 16, 2012 between the hours of 11AM and 5PM. Today, I received a message on my phone stating that I must return some equipment and pay for a balance on some account. I called to find out about this and was told that this account belongs to my sister, which she has the same last name as mine. I have told them that this should have nothing to do with me and that is her account. I have been a customer in the past, in good standing and paid all my bills and returned any equipment. They told me that because I have cancelled my services and she started her service, that I have to still pay for her balance and be charged for the equipment if I don't return it. I feel like this is a bad relationship to start with a previous customer in good standing and that with the monopoly of the area, they are being very abusive making the consumers to pay for other accounts that don't belong to them. This is very bad business practice. Because of this type of practice and the monopoly over the area, it leaves me to not have any internet services at all.
__label__1 They are the worst company on earth. Bad customer service, lousy technicians... etc. The worst thing about them is the billing, they always mess with one's billing. Your bill is guaranteed to be at least $20.00 higher than the quoted price when you get your bill. They always have hidden fees. Comcast s..ks.
__label__1 Comcast is outrageous!! We wanted the security system. I tell you, it's not worth it at all!! Please be aware they want money. Well, what happened with us is ... they had someone else's security on our account; our bill was $400. We are supposed to do 3 months of $133. We got our bill and it's almost $600!! I called, "Why is it high?" She said that we had one more payment of $133 than two months worth which is about $250, $250 and $133; it is not $600... Do not get the security; they will make you broke!!!! Please be aware!!!
__label__0  I am sick of COMCAST treating me like s***.  They have turned off the cable and want 500.00 to turn it back on.  I want the cable fixed or a refund of all the cable part of the bill that I paid. They did give a few credits but not near enough.  They have no right to take my money then refuse to service my account!!!!!!  Who do they think they are??????? 
__label__1 I have paid for service fee protection ($3.95) month for over a year. Each month since the service call in February I have contacted Comcast regarding a $60.00 service fee charged to my account. Four representative have said that the fee would be reversed as well as the "administrative late fee" associated with my not paying the $60.00 I don't owe. In addition the service tech who came to my home in February said to ask for a specific modem yet I was given one which increased my bill by $94 annually. I have been a customer for 10 years and feel pimped by this experience and will not continue to be used.
__label__1 Comcast customer service is deplorable, complete with incompetent, rude and poorly-trained service reps. Instead of improving customer service to attract more customers, Comcast is now trying yet another dirty tactic to increase their revenues and make their customers even more dissatisfied and disgusted. There is no other company I can get ISP so I have no choice but to pay through the nose for Comcast's internet service which NEVER operates at the speed they claim.Last year I cancelled my cable TV service but continued with the internet service (since there is no other ISP in my area).Now, less than a year later, they've figured a new way to screw me - They just sent me a letter saying as of this month they are going to charge $10 per 50 GB of data I use over 300 GB per month. This is EXTORTIONATE! According to the new monitor they've installed, I already used 300 GB in the 1st week. So they offered me a way to avoid this $10 charge. I can pay them $30 a month more for unlimited data so now I'm paying $100 a month for just the internet. This is a 42% increase and I am at their mercy. I have filed a complaint with the FCC and I don't know what else to do. Aren't they violating some anti-trust laws? How is a monopoly allowed to operate? Why is this company still in business?
__label__0 On August 3, 2009, I called Comcast and explained the services I would like to order. (I was matching the services apples for apples to what I currently had.) I requested phone service with unlimited long distance, internet, and cable with a basic line-up with DVRs. The lady gave me a quote for this of $140.82 a month. I agreed, and the appointment was set up for the 13th. She said she would handle the phone service disconnection, and I needed to call my other providers to cancel service, so I canceled service for August 12.On Wednesday, August 12, 2009 (1st day off work), Comcast has an appointment between the hours of 11:00-2:00. Comcast called my home at 10:15 to tell me the install tech would arrive between 12:00-1:00 (I thought great, I can get a few more things done.) The tech arrived at 11:00. He assessed the situation and said he would have to call a supervisor out because of 250 feet of cabling that would have to be done and would inform me of the supervisor's decision. I don't know if the supervisor ever came out, but by 12:30, the tech was gone and never informed me of what was going on. So, I assumed maybe he went for lunch and would return. He never returned, so I started calling Comcast. The first customer service rep told me to be patient and someone would contact me shortly. It didn't happen. I called 4 more times to Comcast. I was told that they were sorry and they would have a supervisor call me back in 30 minutes - same story by all of them. I was at the house waiting on a call till 8:30.Now, I'm very angry. It's a wasted day of vacation. Now, I have no internet service and no TV, and I'm left out in the cold with Comcast. I called my boss to ask for another day off work, so I can get my service with Comcast because certainly they would take care of it. (It's the 2nd day off work.) I started calling Comcast, and I'm passed around to 3 different people and repeated my story over and over again. I'm finally told I would have to wait for a callback with an appointment time. But I'm reassured that something would be done today. I received a call from Comcast letting me know I have an appointment set up for Friday, the 14th.On August 14 (It's the 3rd day off work, but an exciting day because we were going to really get hooked up with service this day. I live in a house with 2 guys and no TV.), the tech arrived around 10:30 and also a cable crew. They both agreed that the cable they were about to lay would not give me a signal at my house but they have to do it anyway and try it. The cable crew completed their work and left the cable on the ground, because they felt they were going to have to upgrade the cable later in the day. The tech was here until 4:00. He was able to get my internet hooked up as well as the phone service, but there's no signal for the cable TV and no DVR boxes. I also told him I didn't want the voice mail. He said he would disconnect it at the box. (He didn't do this.) He said he would call it in and a crew should be back this day to replace the cable and bring boxes. So, I waited till 6:00 and called. I was told I have to request an order with Comcast, so I called Comcast They told me that this would be an additional charge of $60; I was quoted a original price of $140. Once again, I was passed around to 3 people and repeated my frustrating story over and over again. The last person I spoke with said that for 3 DVR boxes, my bill would be about $140. I told them to bring them (2 DVRs and 1 HD DVR). I was told to call back to the dispatch center for an approximate time of the new cabling. They said they would send a supervisor out Saturday.On August 15 (It's the 4th appointment for Comcast, and I had no time off work.), the supervisor arrived around 1:00, listened to my frustrations, installed an amplifier, and informed me I would be charged for this. He came inside and checked the signal strength. There's not enough strength for cable. He agreed that the cabling inside and outside all needed redone and that he himself along with a crew would come on Monday, the 17th to do this. (It's my 4th day off work.) No one ever came on Monday, so I called dispatch. They have no order in their system. I would have to call Comcast. Now, I'm very pissed. Comcast customer service what a treat; once again. I was passed around. They told me someone would call with an appointment time. It looked like it would be Friday. I got a call on Thursday with an 11:00-2:00 time. Ok for me.On August 21 (It's the 5th day off work.), I got up and went to use my phone and I had no service. I tried my internet, and there's no service. So, I decided not to make another aggravating call to Comcast and just waited for the tech to show up and he could address it. I went out on my deck to water my plants, and my garden hose was missing. I thought how strange someone would steal my hose. An hour later, I saw a man on my deck returning the hose. I was frightened and run in the house to call the police. As I was phoning, I was looking out the front window and realized it's the cable crew leaving my house. (Thanks, guys, for showing up, but you should have informed me that you were here and I would have no phone service for a while.)The tech showed up at my house at 1:30 to install an amplifier. I informed him that an amplifier has already been installed over a week ago and I thought he was here to bring me my DVR boxes and replace the inside cabling. He said he could not do anything, except what was on his order and that his order showed the equipment that I had in my house and I already had DVRs. It's not true. I asked him if he could at least come in and check the signal strength since the ground cable was just replaced. He came in, checked it, and told me no and that the whole house would have to redone and the original installation was done wrong. Something outed the splitters. He said I would have nothing but problems. He said before he left my house that he would be calling in with his recommendations and also let them know I have no DVR boxes. I called dispatch about 30 minutes after he left to see what was next. I was told once again to call Comcast. They have nothing in the system. I called Comcast and explained. She told me she wanted to read the notes on file and would call me back. She called back and transferred me to the technical department. This gentleman I talked to said he would get someone out tonight with the DVR boxes and set an appointment up for the re-cabling on Saturday, the 22nd, so that I didn't have to take another day off work. Well, guess what? No one showed up Friday evening, and no one called for an appointment for Saturday. What I did get from Comcast on Saturday was a bill. I feel I should only be charged for internet service and phone service. I should not be charged for rental of the boxes that are not working and are not the right ones anyway. I should not be charged for digital voice that I didn't want, and the tech was to disable it anyway. I should not be charged activation charges or other fees due to my time off work and aggravation. And still, there's no cable TV service. I was still waiting on my boxes and cable TV to be re-wired on Monday, August 24. I called dispatch, and I was told they have no order in the system and couldn't do anything till Comcast send a work order. I talked to Heavier, the supervisor, who made a promise to me and didn't fulfill it. He gave me a line of ** that I didn't appreciate. I want someone to follow through with this and be accountable. I next called Comcast to talk to a supervisor. I was told she would have to call me back. I told them I would hold till she was available. Tandra, a Comcast supervisor, told me she was going to do an investigation and get back with me in a couple of hours. She also gave me a customer satisfaction department phone number. I will be calling now. (I'm angry, frustrated, and out of vacation days.)
__label__1 Comcast discriminated against me by denying me internet access because I wouldn't take their bundle. I only wanted XFINITY internet. My neighbors have XFINITY internet and cable TV with Comcast. I signed up for XFINITY internet on 6/23/12 and paid for the cable modem. Comcast reps strung me along for 3 weeks. I called repeatedly to set up service, but their reps kept telling me that a supervisor was reviewing my address and to call back in a couple of days. Over and over again we played this game until finally I was told they can't service my address. Funny, Comcast services all my neighbors. When I try to do a search for an ISP at my address, they all say Comcast is the only ISP that can service my address. On top of all this, while they were happy to sell me the cable modem, I was told I had to deal with the company that sent me the cable modem directly to get a refund. I didn't even know there was a different company to deal with. Comcast's reps refused to help me get my money back or allow me to speak with someone in the company that could help me. I eventually got my refund on the cable modem, but only after having to deal directly with some company in Tennessee or somewhere. Comcast's customer service has to be the worst I've ever come upon. No one from Comcast even attempted to contact me during the 3 weeks I was waiting to connect my service. I had to make numerous calls to them. On top of which, no one could answer my questions. I was told time and again that the supervisor who was reviewing my address was unavailable and I should call back next Monday or Tuesday, etc. Comcast's reps kept telling me to call back in two or three days and they would have the information for me. I thought I was going to have a stroke. I was so upset when they finally told me they couldn't service my address for internet.
__label__1 Was called by Comcast sales on 9/30/14 @ 4:00 pm. Was not impressed with the way this call started out. Already disrespectful voice kept talking over me and made me get very angry. Was told my discounts will fall off. I would like to sue them for calling me and ruining family dinner and rest of day.
__label__1 When I first had Comcast installed, I got the triple play at $119.00. It cost $232.00 for installation, which I paid. I then get an invoice the following week for $183.00. I finally got someone on the phone and they told me it was not only for the service but for equipment rental of the DVR and the wireless modem for the internet service, not to mention some kind of converter for the phone. That's ridiculous. They also charge extra for voice mail and call waiting. They don't give you a choice whether or not you want it.I told them I don't want the phone service anymore. They said if I cancelled the phone service, I'd have to pay full price on the remaining services and equipment. I just cried. I'm on a fixed income. On TV they tell you there is no contract but there really is. They lie so much. I told them why they didnt advertise that their pricing doesn't include equipment rental. They said they don't have to. I told them it's false advertisement and they are liars. They said they did nothing wrong. How do you fight them? Then I read in the paper the highest paid CEOs in the Philly area are the Comcast CEOs. They are worth billions. It's not fair. I feel like I'm being robbed. If they are getting that much money, they are charging way too much.
__label__1 Comcast came to my door at about 6pm tonight, March 5, 2012. He did not knock, he banged. Before I could get up to answer the door, he banged louder. I opened and he began his solicitation and I politely said, "Oh we already have cable. We're good, thanks. He said, "But do you have Comcast?" I said, "No, we're good with our cable, thanks but no thanks." He pushed again, asking who our cable company was. I had to close the door while he was still gesturing and talking. I tried to be polite.This was not an okay solicitation. Do not send another Comcast employee to my house or I will call the police and report the individual and you as a company. Leave us alone. Thank you.
__label__5 I had the triple play service for 2 years. The quality of service was excellent. TV: Excellent video quality. Internet: Very fast and never went down. Phone: Best of the IP services in voice quality. I cannot comment on DVR since I use Sage and my PC (12 TB) for my TV service. When I turned off this service to switch to AT&T Internet, Dish Satellite and some small IP phone, it took 3 months for Comcast to turn off the service and stop billing me. Only when I threatened to file an FTC complaint did they turn off my account and stop billing me. Now, I purchased a new house with no line of sight for Dish or DirectTV. So I thought let's just order the Digital Starter and a 2-year agreement from Comcast. The web order failed, the chat order failed and I am afraid to call them after reading all of these.
__label__0    Comcast has the most confusing printed bills in the world for a reason. Money.After returning their boxes, turning off their internet and going to basic service they were still charging me for full service. I called them. I was told that Comast bills a month in advance but I would have these charges removed from my bill next month but I had to pay even though it was the wromg amount. So tell me how much my bill will be monthly. I was told $67.15. I asked repeatly how much will my monthly bill be after I paid this hugh bill. $67.15 per month. Okay I even took this guys employee number down ( which was made up)For 3 months I sent $67.15 per month. This is the amount Comcast told me to pay. Now they have cut my service off and turned me over to collections because my monthly payments are actually $87.50. Now all these short payments have piled into $300.00. I fought over an hour with a supervisor last night explaining again and again that I paid the amount Comcast said I owed. Over and over I asked him why he didn't pull the taped conversation I had when I was told to pay $67.15. He was sorry for the miscommunication but pay up or else be cut off. I'm on a fixed income. I made the original call to them to stop them from charging me for what I didnt have and to find out what my monthly bill was going to be after all my service cut backs. $67.15 is what they told me and thats what I've been paying. This is their fault not mine but they will not take responsibility. They want the money and thats it. 
__label__0 It was not the individual. All they can do is take the complaint, which she did and she apologized. What happened is that I have the full Comcast package with cable TV, internet and telephone. We upgraded to the HBO package. It is over $100 a month. The problem is I turned on my once a week special series on MasterPiece Theatre on our local public TV station and the audio feed was not working. Yet every other channel was working. As soon as the program was over, the audio came back. I missed part 3 of the Little Dorrit program - an English adaptation written by Charles Dickenson. The customer agent checked to see when it was going to be on again and could not find any part 3 being shown again. I do not want to pay Comcast over $100 a month for what I see as sub-level technology.
__label__0 I am having all kind of problem with my comcast service at business. I am dealing with Schaumburg, IL call center. Don't know what they are doing. Specially, I will give some names--Jeniffer, Ed, Rob and also their supervisors name David and Chris. They do not have any answer of your questions on same phone call.Lost more than $3000.00 in credit card business for the weekend.
__label__1 I would like to share my story about Comcast after upping my bill to 160.00 per month. I was having problems with my home phone so I called customer service, I could not get any help from the USA. When I asked for someone from the USA I was treated very rudely. Long story short, I told Comcast that I would be dropping their home phone and internet but keeping their cable. Set a date to shut off home phone and internet for 10 days later due to the customer service I received from overseas. The next day when I get home from work, no TV no internet no home phone so I call customer service again from overseas. The girl is laughing at me as I explain my problem, tell me there is an outage in my area so I hang up and spend an hour to get someone from the USA who then tells me there is no outage in my area and after I explain about the girl working for their customer service over seas laughing at me, they apologize, credit my bill as I waited for my new service. Comcast overseas keeps on messing with my service. Not only will I be getting rid of their internet but I have decided to get rid of their cable also. A horrible company with horrible service. Do not get them. You will be sorry, shameful company. Horrible customer service, outrageous bills.
__label__1 I opened an internet service with comcast about 20 days ago, and since day one there is a problem with the service, my account address, and finally with the bill. I contacted them through online chat and phone calls about 12 times, with nothing solved, and every time I beg them for a supervisor to call me, with no reply at all. I want to file a complaint now against them and claim for this very bad service and lost time.
__label__0 This company set up an scheduled appointment for me on 6-4-08 The tech was a no show. When I called I was told they would have the tech call me and he did to say sorry he wasnt given the equipment to do the job by his supervisor so he couldnt come!  That led to many more calls to Comcast and being put on hold repeatedly, being disconnected, and being given very inaccurate information about exactly when someone would be out. They then rescheduled a tech and didn't let us know by coutesy of a phone call or anything. I had to pay someone 30.00 to sit at the home waiting. Yesterday 170.00 was lost from work to stay home and wait. This doesn't include airtime charges incurred by being put on hold so much over the course of 2 days.They kept either disconnecting me today and giving me incorrect information regarding times and I don't know how this company is still is business. A class action lawsuit should be filed for all the monies lost by people being  left hanging waiting for no show techs and the customer service people lying to the consumers.monies lost from work to stay home and wait for installation, airtime charges being put on hold for long periods of time. having to pay people to saty at the home and wait so you dont miss anymore work.
__label__1 A Comcast rep called me one night offering a bundle of internet and cable. She said if I decided not to keep the plan, I could revert back to my current plan within 30 days. I explained I had an old AOL plan that was $30 something dollars a month. She told me it would go back to exactly the plan I already have. The conversation was recorded by the way.I called Comcast today and said I wanted to cancel the new service and go back to my original plan. They said I could not go back to the old plan. They now want to charge me double for what I already have. 
__label__0 We moved into our place in Sept of 2009. On the first week of living here, we decided to get cable TV and internet through Comcast. Six months of making appointments and nobody was showing up to do the installation. One appointment every month for six months and nobody ever called or showed up. So, we went through with Dish Network for cable. However, we still needed internet. After one last call to Comcast to see about maybe their showing up this time. We called on 7-8-10 and they made yet another appointment for the next Sunday (today) 7-11-10 between 12 and 2pm. They actually showed up. Only this time the tech looked at our wall and said he needed to drill a hole. We said okay. He went outside and called his "superior" who then showed up and told us that even though every house around us had Comcast service that we cannot get the internet here through their company. They gave some excuse about some pole that exceeds a 250 ft limit; some garbage about aerial trespassing.
__label__1 I give my experience a big fat zero star but I had to pick one. Not one but two Comcast technicians came into my house and dismantled my existing TV antenna system, Satellite system, and part of my Ethernet network! After two separate installation attempts, two technicians, two lost days of work, and still no service. I asked them to remove all of their equipment and return the house wiring to its original condition. What I got were two technicians that got into their trucks and left! They just left! I had to disconnect their equipment and attempt to reinstall some semblance of a working system until I could call out an expert to do the repairs.Calling an expert cost me $138.0 just to get part of the system(s) in working order and the rest of the recabling will take several hundred dollars more to trace each wire or cable that these clowns removed for no reason!One last note, the so-called technicians come in rundown trucks, no Comcast markings and it seems to me that they are hired outside contractors. I don't think these "gentlemen" were Comcast employees. At least the AT&T guy that came to repair some of the damage, which these guys created, was neat, had and ID, and had a marked truck.I wanted to switch to Comcast because of a lower price. I guess, you get what you pay for!
__label__0 Due to the recent acquisition of Patriot Media, I am now a Comcast customer...and a very unhappy one at that.  I have now been without telephone service for one week and, less importantly, internet for three days.  After multiple calls to Comcast during the first days of the telephone outage, my husband and I were told some of the following things:  There are only certain call centers who are handling your area, but you cannot speak to them.  Please hold while I talk to them about your problem.  Can't you just use your cell phone?  You were not entered in our database prior to the switch-over of service.  The problem is with your modem.  The problem is on our end with the communication between our system and your modem.  There is nothing I can do to help you.  You will have to wait for a call back to schedule a service call since you are not in our computer.  And, as of today, someone who was probably the most honest yet:  If we cannot figure out the problem, we will not be able to provide telephone service to you.  Ok, so I get that there are growing pains with any merger/acquisition, but this is ridiculous.  If Comcast could not handle the customers of Patriot Media, they should NEVER have taken over the company.  So, when we first started calling, they kept telling us that we couldn't be scheduled for a service call because we weren't in their database.  But they opened a ticket and would have someone from the designated call center give us a call to set up a time.  The call-back never happened.  So, my husband and I took turns multiple times a day calling them back to get someone to do something productive.  We kept hearing the same thing about the call center and they couldn't help us (blah, blah, blah), and then I decided to search Comcast's website for a complaint email address.  I found one for the VP of customer service.  I'm no idiot, so I know it's a general mailbox, but within two hours of submitting the email I received a call from the corporate office in Princeton, NJ.  The woman was very nice to me, but ultimately, couldn't help me.  She DID, however, schedule a service call for Sunday morning.  The tech came, replaced the modem, but couldn't get the phone to work because the tech in the office was too busy to put our new modem info into the database while the other tech was still in our house.  I knew that was trouble.    So, here we are...7 days and counting with no phone, and 3 days without internet.  So, I called this morning and immediately asked the customer service rep. for her supervisor.  I got one, and asked him if Comcast even knew what the underlying problem was.  He admitted that they do not, and if they can't figure it out, they're just not going to be able to provide phone service to us.  WOW!  So, because Comcast bought our cable company, and we were forced to switch to their service, and there are now major problems that they can't figure out, my family is just supposed to accept the fact that we may not be able to have our phone through the cable company anymore.  So, if that happens, Comcast will just raise the rates of the cable because we can't have the triple package.    I don't think I have ever dealt with a company as inept and unethical as Comcast.  If you do have a choice for your cable, internet, and/or phone, DON'T CHOOSE COMCAST. Most importanly, my family has had no access to 911.  Also, I work from home two days a week to save on gas and mileage.  Now that I have no phone or internet, I can't do that.  Also, the emotional stress that my husband and I have been under just trying to get our phone restored has been daunting.  The attitude that Comcast has taken (We bought your cable company, your phone doesn't work, there's nothing we can do to figure out the problem, so tough) is appalling.
__label__1 Where to start... I guess it's due to the monopoly that they have no reason to service customers. I moved into a Xfinity-only area and after 2 days, I could not be more dissatisfied. I've experienced no less than 5 errors, 2 related to channel lineup, 2 related to erroneous overbilling. (It's never underbilling is it?!) The most hilarious tale of incompetence was when they added a $10 charge for a rented modem when I added channels and I called to ask them to remove it as I own my own modem - instead of removing the charge, they added a second charge just for kicks. (As if I had 2 rented modems!!) I called back and the agent this time said he can't authorize it and he's submitted a ticket which will take 7-10 days to correct. He also suggested I call back before 7 days because 'this process isn't perfect!' I wish I had any other option than Comcast but they have a monopoly here. About time that changed.
__label__5 It is IMPOSSIBLE to talk with a real person when you try to phone. It is equally impossible to report problems through e-mails. I have tried to report unburied cable in my neighborhood and I cannot reach anyone by phone or internet. WORST customer service ever! My cable box stopped working. It took three different "technicians" to replace a new box. I was told that all the XFINITY boxes have been recycled. I think I am paying too much for just internet and cable TV (not the top of the level). Internet service and TV service frequently go out. The prices for my limited service increase on a regular basis. I would use another company if I could but satellite dishes get no reception where I live. The customer service element is simply non-existent. They have customers who cannot voice their opinions.
__label__1 Well it started with a few internet issues that was the result of a bad connection with the splitter. Like any reasonable person I called Comcast to have this issue taken care of. They sent me a cable technician to fix the problem which took him about 3 minutes to replace the splitter. After this he decided he was going to spend the rest of the hour at Wendy's on a "lunch break." Following this issue the next bill a mysterious 39.95 charge showed up for a technician visit (because they charge for faulty equipment). I decided not to worry about this and carry on with my life. The next months bill was normal. Then the next month (2 months later) I had a total of $100 in charges for "video/internet installation" and the installation of 4 outlets for my devices (none of which happened). After much debate with comcast representatives I was told that my original requests never made it to their supervisors to be waived. After waiting 48 hours I called back again. This time an american agent told me the first ticket I received was actually viewed by a supervisor and rejected with no reasoning given. For all I am concerned these are bogus charges.
__label__1 The service that we receive in our area is awful. We have complained on numerous occasions and have the technicians out a number times with no improvement. I will never recommend Comcast to anyone!
__label__1 We are already paying an outrageous amount for cable and our cable box goes out. I call to set up an appointment for a new cable box. My husband went ahead and switched cable boxes at the office. Comcast called, I missed the call and called back. When returning the call, I told them I needed to cancel the service appointment. They transferred me to a live representative. In the process, the background employees were laughing loudly and screaming. I told the representative, "I'm having a hard time hearing you with the background noise." He started laughing and said, "Sorry, my coworkers are losing their minds." This was so odd. I hung up.
__label__1 First they sent me a converter box that I didn't ask for, then I was always dealing with outages. Now, I just got a collection notice for my last bill. I disconnected service 6/15/2015, the collection notice is dated 7/24/15. Why is it fair that they would send it to collections already? I'll add that when I called to disconnect, the CSA gave me the runaround until I said I was recording the conversation. Why can't Comcast give their customers what they want and not try to treat them like garbage?
__label__1 Ordered Comcast on April 28th internet and television. Quote was $116.00 a month for the first year. Comcast mailed a defective box for a $15.00 self install. I called tech support and they sent out a tech guy who simple replaced their defective box. I was told by the Comcast technician, there would be no extra charge for this call. Next, an email arrives saying my monthly bill will be $220.00 per month. I called their billing department, am told the email is wrong and my actual bill is going to be $127.79 per month.A month later, an email arrives and tells me I am being billed $320.00. Called their billing department and was told this was for April 28 until the end of June. That is 2 months and 3 days. The $15.00 self install morphed into a $92.00 service call. I asked for a supervisor and was told there was none available but I would receive a call back today. Of course that never happened. My days are numbered at Comcast.
__label__1 I got my internet speed check and highest it got was 0.02 at 3:00pm - 2:30am and at the middle of the morning I get to 3.00 internet speed, so that mean I cannot go on internet unless I want to stay up all night.
__label__1 COMCAST/ Xfinity offers the worst customer service. I was paying $34 for the modem and my internet service. I wouldn't complain about the internet service going in and out because yes, it was inexpensive. Almost 12 months with them, I started receiving calls that my bill will go back to the normal price, $79.99, if I didn't change to another promotional price and added TV. I'm not a big fan of watching TV. Ok so I went ahead and picked a bundle for $49.99 a month. My services went off for 7 days when I saw 2 Xfinity men tampering with the Xfinity box outside of my residence. I called customer service, told them I was not going to pay my bill ahead if my services were not up and running. She said, "I can send a technician to the residence to solve the problem at the cost $50." I told her I'd rather cancel than pay someone to fix something 2 Xfinity employees tampered.She informed me that she can waive that fee. I said, "ok if you're going to waive that fee then I'll pay my bill whenever I get my service restored." 4 days later, I arrived home my service were restored. I called the next day to check on my bill and see if the service was waived and if I received a credit into my account for being off 7 days. They informed me that my bill was $33 so I went ahead and paid it. Month after that, my bill shows $141. I called and questioned them and they said that "The fee wasn't waived, it's $99. We're sorry for who ever misinformed you but you still have to pay the fees.'' "A sorry doesn't pay the bills,'' I said. She went ahead and said, "we can credit half." I said, "ok we can do that." I asked, "So how much is my bill now?''. She said, "$116." "That is not half off the service man, that's just 25% off. They told me it was $99 for the service man," and she said, "That service man was $50. Sorry again for being misinformed. I'm just holding on the line." In my mind these people don't know what to say anymore or what to lie about with Xfinity. I've always paid my bill a month ahead.
__label__0 Comcast is taking channels away from their basic service then trying to get you to pay $7-$8 per month to get them back via cable set box rental. They claim they can change their channel line up at any time so you are stuck. They have taken away 8 high definition channels and three other channels for a total of 11 channels, you have no recourse except go to Rabbit ears to get your Hi-Def Local channels or go to satellite service. I think that our apartment building should receive the $7-$8 per month per unit back as they decreased our service in that amount. Maybe some attorney out there would like to file a class action against these deceptive business practices.
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer for 5 yrs and fortunately have not had any issues recently. It appears that Comcast has outsourced most of its customer service. My internet connection was dropping intermittently for the last 5 days and I called to get some help. My call first went to Mexico and the man there was unable to help me. He transferred me to Mike in the USA and he was able to get my service working again. About 1 hour later the problem started again. I once again called customer service this time ending up in the Philippines. That lady told me she would need to schedule an apt for a technician to come out between 12 and 2 pm. At 2 pm I had not heard from anyone so I called back. This time my call was sent to Columbia. That man told me that the appt. was between 12 and 5pm. Once again I waited and 5pm came and went with no technician at my home and no phone call from Comcast. I called back customer service once again and this time spoke with someone in Panama who told me that my appt. had been cancelled! I asked to speak with a supervisor and was finally transferred to a man in Schaumburg, IL who told me that there was never any appt. scheduled for me and that the information I was given was "fraudulent". Needless to say I'm furious. Comcast makes millions off its customers and should be ashamed of itself for trying to cut cost and send customer service overseas. If I had another option for internet service I would change companies, but I don't have any other options where I'm located! Beware of terrible customer service and of bold face lies from this company!
__label__1 Comcast sucks... and not in a good way but the worst way possible. After navigating through a seemingly never ending exchange of automated answers to finally get to speak to a person to only get someone whose English is so poor I finally have up on trying to get the DVR issue (it just quit working a few weeks ago) resolved and was at least pathetically satisfied they admitted I received an auto call saying I was behind on my bill and was risking having my services disconnected... For such a large corporation that makes plenty of profit they are amazingly and ashamedly horrible in the efficiency department.
__label__1 I have had Comcast for 12 years and have been displaced the entire time. We would have changed to EPB in our area but because we live in a condo the wiring cannot be compatible or run between buildings. Customer service stinks if you ever try to reach them by phone and on occasion, more often than not, channels will just not be aired and they have no explanation.
__label__5 They present well but deliver poorly. My DVR died. Called support, determined a replacement was needed, and it was to be mailed to me. Received replacement, replacement did not work. Called again, they told me they would send a repairman out & would CHARGE ME! I cancelled service. Had to return equipment to a local store of theirs. Waited in their store with over 200 people & 1 service person working behind thick plexiglass. One person working!! Waited close to 2 hrs before my number was called. Poor. The costs are too high, their equipment is old, software interface is poor. Service (getting a picture/programs) was reliable, the equipment was not. Quit taking advantage of your subscribers by delivering outdated software, hardware, poor customer service and equipment.
__label__1 I just had Comcast internet set up for businesses today. The installation went fine and the service is fast. I have it set up so that my customers can connect to the internet when then are smoking Hookah at my place. The issue is that when they connect to the public network they have to sign in using their comcast info. What happens if they don't have Comcast you may ask... THEY HAVE TO PAY TO USE A NETWORK I AM ALREADY PAYING FOR! They have to make an account with Comcast and then pay to use my internet! HOW CAN I PROVIDE GOOD SERVICE LIKE THAT? When I originally called to have everything set up THAT'S WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MY CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE TO PAY. But that would make me not get it so they fail to mention that little fact! COMCAST HAS THE WORST SERVICE!
__label__5 On December 28, 2013, I requested internet services to be connected to my captioned phone/router (I am hearing impaired) from Comcast cable through Mr. Ron **. He brought an internet box and a telephone number and told me to call the number for activation and installation. I told him I was hearing impaired and could not use ordinary phone. When I called the number, I could not understand anything being said so I went to my local library and met Mrs. **, a staff who offered to help me. She told me they wanted me to call from my home and Comcast technician would guide me though the installation. On January 4 2014, I called Mr. ** to come and install the phone or take his equipment away. He did not respond to my call, so the next day I called and left a message cancelling the order. On January 13, 2014 I received a bill from Comcast demanding payment for installation and service totaling $115.69. I find it hard to believe that this company is demanding money for service never rendered. I am unable to get in touch with my friends and family because I cannot call them. I think this company is trying to defraud me.
__label__0  They have made it clear, customer service is not a priority. They have also made it clear Comacast can not handle repairs timely or satisfactorily. It has been five days and we still have no clear understanding as to this company is doing to resolve this problem. We have a list of names and history if it would be any help to you. 
__label__1 I would like to give Comcast NEGATIVE stars... So many negative stars that Comcast actually owes me stars. First off, when I signed up at the business in Nowheresville, Illinois, I had asked if I could get service immediately. The representative had claimed yes, YOU can. Famous last words. She had got on her tablet and stated that someone already had a Comcast account at my address. She asked me to retype my address. Fair enough, I did. Afterwards her tablet provides info that says the same thing. She calls over her Russian supervisor who claims that I put in the wrong address. I stated "No, I have put it in twice and it is correct." The man proceeded to ask me for my license to show my address. It should have been a red flag right there.I'm ok with showing my driver's license. No problem. Except the fact that I live in Ohio and go to school in Illinois. I was renting a place during the school year and desired television and internet. When I refused to show my Driver's license, the supervisor called me a liar and later asked if I was supposed to have a place in the States. After I explained it to him that I was a student, he pulled up my address and the file had said that someone had started service at my address 2 weeks prior. I had to explain I just moved there 3 days earlier. So we finally get that figured out. The supervisor had thought that the other account was put on the wrong address. Whatever figured it out.So I go home, install the equipment myself through their somewhat adequate automatic voice command software providing installment advise. After I installed the internet modem, I began installing the cable box. The cable box equipment didn't work. Called Comcast 1-800 number and the lady understood and sent me a new box "free of charge."Then I go home, install the new box and I had to call the 1-800 number and have them turn on the box. However when I called, I had a bunch of registration errors because the box I had was not on my account. Kept saying wrong equipment number. After pressing 15 different numbers, the robot voice might actual turn out to be someone who works there so I could explain what I needed. Got the equipment number changed for my account info. Good to go, right? Wrong. I was supposed to take my old box and place in shipping boxes that were provided "free of charge" and take the box to UPS and have them ship it out to Comcast itself. I take it to UPS and they state the postage on the box is for the wrong amount and force me to pay $6.45 to ship Comcast's mistake back to them. Whatever. It's $6... What's that?... like 6 tacos from Taco Bell. Good to go then, right?Wrong. I continue to get service and pay my bills on time I might add, but at month three, I start getting endless letters for unpaid bills. Question mark goes up in my head so I call Comcast again. Long story short, these unpaid bills came from the account that they had mistakenly put on my address. Remember the guy who called me a liar and said that someone registered service for my address 2 weeks before I moved in. Yeah, those bills weren't getting paid. I was paying my bills, not this fake account on my address. Got that figured out after receiving threats of shutting down my service, which was already paid for. Got that figured out.Months go by and I started noticing that my bills were not for the same amount. 1st month was $105.78, 2nd month was $96.58 (correct amount), 3rd month $98 and change, 4th month was $96.58 (correct amount), etc. it was about month 6 that I figured it out. So I had to call that pesky 1-800 number. Turns out that my bill was being sent from multiple Comcast billing locations. One was including the taxes and fees associated with my state. And the wrong amounts were coming from another state with the taxes and fees associated with their state. Figured that out and they couldn't refund all of the overcharges but gave me money on my account to go towards my next bill. Ok. Whatever. I ended up getting like 84% of the overcharges back... It ended up being the cost of a nice 6-pack. Whatever. Done, right? No more issues, right? Wrong!!! At the end of the year, I needed to return the equipment and drop the service. Fine and dandy. I go to take the equipment back in Illinois on a Saturday. The people there had told me that I did not have all of my equipment. Ok no worries, but I was moving the next day to Tennessee and their offices are not open on Sundays. I go home, grab the one small piece of equipment that I forgot. I call 1-800-Comcast to figure out where the nearest location was to drop off my equipment in Tennessee. They provide the address for me! Yay, something useful. Pack up the equipment and my belongings and move to Tennessee.Go to the address I was provided on that Friday after moving in. Explained I do not need your services, I'm returning your equipment, here you go. The guy at the Tennessee location says ok but this equipment doesn't belong here, it belongs back in Illinois and he agrees to ship it back to Illinois free of charge. He had mentioned that there maybe termination fees involved with my account. Ok, go ahead.Two months go by and I start getting letters forwarded to my new address in Tennessee and Comcast began charging me late fees for not returning my equipment and that I owed interest and all this ** (pardon my language if ladies are reading this). So I call 1-800-STUPID-COMCAST (sarcasm, but I really called Comcast's 1-800 number). They checked their system in Illinois and my equipment was not there. It was sitting in a warehouse in Tennessee and I, not Comcast, had to figure out that it was wasting away in Tennessee via visiting their Tennessee location. Anyway, they ship it to Illinois for it to only sit there for another 2 weeks for them to figure out that my equipment belonged to another location in a different state. Remember at the beginning when my equipment didn't work and they sent me a new equipment box. Yeah my new box came from another warehouse in a different state. Meanwhile I'm hanging in the balance as COMCAST gets their crap together. I ended up with a $433 in late fee and taxes... Now paid after never being late on a single payment. Thanks for letting me now via phone or email Comcast. I had a 760 credit score... Who knows what it is now.BTW, 90% of the people you call on the 1-800 number have no clue what they are doing & those that do are smart enough to find a better work environment. The employees are terrible at taking customer notes. All customers be warned, you will have to repeat your information 50 times each call... You may be hung up on either on accident or on purpose. Some employees are not very good at pressing the hold button.Also Comcast is looking and will screw any person harder than a Philips screw driver on a flathead nail into concrete. Open up your pocket books and create a bank account called "Comcast ** fund" cause you're going to need it. Consider yourself warned. Comcast can take a long walk off a short pier.
__label__1 By far the worst company in the world! From the technicians, customer service, and service itself. I have too many details to share which I don't feel like getting into but stay away! If you have other options in your area like FIOS for example, go with them. I hope they go out of business. One thing I will share though... One of the technicians who came to my house broke my TV stand and let it sit on two speakers to keep it upright... I didn't notice until a few days later... Can you believe that? Also, they are notorious for charging you randomly for random things. The internet speed is NEVER what you pay for. Unfortunately, I am stuck with them for now until I move because my area has limited providers. Save yourself the trouble. Choose someone else.
__label__0 I called comcast cable for service and they sent someone out on saturday 13,2008 between 1&3 pm. no problem. the service man shows-up without a pre-call from the company which I was told I would receive.He had no tools no work order and after switching some wires and adding wires which I supplied he informs me that my television is broken .He never called anyone. He said that a supervisor(who's name is Joe) will come out because I refused to except his explaination.This is a brand new television and the third time that I have called for service and was told my television was broken only to have to wait for someone else to come out( a much longer wait time I must add)to say oh! the last service rep did something wrong.I usually get a follow-up call and it's been three days and still no call,no supervisor,and the wires that the service rep switched around have not been corrected.Also at that time I was offered a 3 (mon.)trial service where they would come and fix anything connected to the cable for free then after the 3 (mon.) it would be $5.95 pre mon.On October 22,2008 Comcast Cable came out to connect my tv,dvd,and,vhs and to repair a loose wire. If at this time my equipment is broken they did it.
__label__0 This is also a free speech issue, though I shouldn't have to claim a right to free speech to speak to my family. Harrassment - They made unsolicited sales calls to my home. Financial - They are overcharging me, sending collectors after me, and refusing to compensate for undelivered service and false charges.
__label__1 I have had cable & internet service with Comcast/Xfinity for several months now. My internet service is constantly dropping. For about the past 1 1/2 to 2 months, I have been constantly resetting my modem or calling for them to send a signal. I have been on the phone with agents for nearly an hour at a time doing what they call a series of troubleshooting techniques. They finally scheduled a tech, which I'm told I may have to pay for. I just got off the phone with them again and they said no tech is coming... He was not scheduled. I have been waiting a week and now they want me to wait another 9 days to get a tech to my house. In the meantime, I am left paying $150 a month for service that I can not even use... But they want their payment on time or they'll shut me off. Oh but they did give me a 2 day credit like I was suppose to shout with joy over a probably $3 credit. Save yourself time and stress by getting service elsewhere.
__label__1 Comcast wanted customers to upgrade their modems with their new ones. I did that. They mailed the new modem to me. It was a self install but I could not do it so I called and had them send a technician out to install and had to pay for that. That was fine but after that the WIFI in the modem never worked properly - I kept being drop while using my tablet or Netflix. I called for months regarding this. Comcast had me calling other places and doing things. Finally just before the Holidays I called Comcast once again and someone there said, "Well let me check into something." And whatever he did he informed me that the WIFI in the modem was defective and it needed to be replaced. They had to send another new modem. I told them at the time "But I need someone again to come out and install it." And I told them I did not want to pay a second time to have another one installed. Each time I spoke to the Service department and to billing and I made sure to check into it I was told there would not be a charge since it was due to Comcast's defective modem. Well lo and behold when I get my bill they not only charged me a 15.00 shipping for another modem they charged me a service charge for the technician a second time and taxes on top of everything. I called to speak with a supervisor and they were not going to credit me. Also saying no notes on my account which I thought very strange since there should have been many notes since I called them on many occasions. I finally was able to get a credit of 50.00 only on a 88.17 charge. I am very upset about this and will eventually change providers. Hoping AT&T will come my way asap. Beware, Comcast has terrible customer service and has no problem outright lying to a customer to turn around and get them in the back. Their price are also outrageous.
__label__1 A representative from Comcast came to my house and offered us the Comcast deal.  We initially refused because we were under contract with DirecTV and we have top pay $240 to disconnect it.  He offered us $200 so I can disconnect DirecTV.  I accepted it and paid DirecTV $240 and disconnected it.  I waited for three months and asked them about the $200.  They told me to talk to the rebate department.  I called them and they said that there is nothing for them to process.  So, I called Comcast and they said that they will process it and I just have to wait for two to three weeks.  I waited for a month and called them again.  Now, they acted like this is the first time that I'm calling.  They said that they need to get in touch with the sales person who promised me.Nine months have passed and I have never received the rebate.  When it was time for me to relocate, I called them back and they said that I would have to pay the $70 relocation fee.  I told them to send me the rebate check, which was promised to me, and I will disconnect.  They refused to send me the check.  They wanted their DVR back and they keep charging me.  I have moved from that location and I am now with Verizon.  I told them that if they give me the rebate check, I will return the DVR.  In the end, I lost $240 because of Comcast.
__label__1 I was asking the guy on phone why when I subnet themes router it make Comcast go down. The guy then said "don't hook the cable from the router to a cable box". I had said 6 or 8 times cat 5 or cat 6 wire why would that type be hook to a cable box. I ask what he was talking about he said "rg6 cable jack on modem should not be hook to cable box." WOW he wasn't listening to me. I have video game systems I would rather have use cat 6 wire then WiFi but I also have network printer with only rj45 and 1 out of 4 tv has a dead WiFi chip that 2 port and I plan on network hard drive 3 port and number 4 desktop. He said "Comcast didn't teach them about anything about networking. They learn only about Comcast gear" that when I hung up my network speed is going to be 150mbps. I don't understand why. If it that high you can't subnet theme home internet. I would buy a router/modem but none has phone line for fax.
__label__1 I live in Treasure Coast FL and have been trying to get the internet working since August 21, 2016 - now 19 Sept. It has been on and off, on and off, on and off. ONLY in their Corp area do they make customer service a priority.
__label__5 My service was interrupted for non-payment due to unrelated expenses for family member passing away. When I arrived back home a week later I paid the outstanding bill. A month later I received my bill and saw the extra charges. I decided to call Comcast. I spoke to a customer service representative about getting credit for the two weeks my service was suspended. Comcast bills a month in advance so I feel I did not have service for two weeks that I should not have to pay for service I did not receive. The response I received was that I still have service I just do not have access to the service.I was charge a reactivation fee for each service. $5.00 for phone, $5.00 for internet and $2.00 for the TV plus I pay $200.00 plus a month. Comcast will not credit me the two weeks which is $100.00, $7.00 late fee and $12.00 reactivation fee that is a total of $119.00 Comcast has made for service I did not have access to. Comcast is doing this to all the customers that have had their service suspended for a week or two.Comcast has 22.9 million cable customers, 16.7 million high-speed Internet customers, and 8.4 million voice customers. If 3,000 customers have had their service suspended for two weeks that would be $300,000.00 Comcast has received from people who are struggling to pay their bill. Then if this happens every month whether it be the same customers or to different customers, Comcast now has a great business model on how to charge for services to customers without providing service to your customers. I must say that is a great way to make a profitable business but how can anyone trust a company like this. They charge you for a cup of coffee but all you get is an empty cup. You can see the coffee pot but you cannot reach it from the other side of the counter. You can still have coffee but you just don't have access to it.
__label__0 I have been without internet service for a week and have had unusable service for over two weeks now. With Comcast, a regular technician has to be scheduled to come out before maintenance can come out and fix any issues outside the house. Maintenance was scheduled for the 1st of October, but they never fixed the issue. I had called the support number every day to find out what was going on and they kept telling me they were working on it.Today, I called them and was told that maintenance for the repair was cancelled and they just put in their notes issue not fixed. I called the first technician and his supervisor to find out what happened and why. All I get is their voicemail immediately and still no answers to my polite messages that I have left for both of them. So now they have to call another technician so they can schedule another maintenance person to come out to fix the issue; if that ever happens. This Monopoly MUST stop! Where are you Verizon FIOS?! One thing is known: I or no one else here will not have to worry about breaking Comcast's new acceptable use policy.
__label__1 Please do not utilize this service. They will promise great things to get you to sign up but no customer service after up to and including outright lies. I was with DirecTV, two HD DVR's, one other HD set top and one other normal definition set top. This was bundled with phone and internet at 6Mbs. The bill for this was at $130.00 roughly.I called xfinity/comcast and they quoted me $59/month for 50Mbs internet and phone. I specifically asked that I needed to keep certain channels (espn, amc, natgeo were among these). No mention of installation costs and confirmation that there was no contract but this price was good for two years. I received my first bill of $177. Since this day the nightmare they call customer service has not been able to resolve the billing issue. They insist that I signed up for the "triple play" at $89/month.Internet speed averages around 7Mbs. I have called their customer service and the CSR told me that they were having lots of issues with the cisco modem/router combo and that I would get better speeds if I bought my own router and modem. I did so ($250) but the speeds did not change. I called them once again and they sent a tech out 2 days later (two hours late for appointment). He said the signal from the curb to my house was ok, but signal to the area was bad. He stated that an engineer would be send out to correct it. Next day an automated call from comcast informed me the situation was fixed but I am still at 5-12 Mbs. This issue continues...Back to tv programming: at least 8 calls have been place to resolve programming. And at each call the situation with my programming gets worse. It even seems there may be some vindication happening as they reduced my service to the basic 30 channels (all crud btw) at midnight last night. When I call them today (Sunday) they say they cannot change service as their resolution center is closed.I am a consultant and am now going to be sending invoices at a charge rate of $300/hour for every hour I spent on the phone I am not billing to my customers. 4 hours today and counting. Now it seems they have put my box into deactivated mode. They insist that they cannot restore my channels without a 2-year agreement and $135/month billing rate. Do not do business with these people! Stay with Dish/DirecTV at all costs. The change will not be worth it.
__label__1 My wife and myself attempted to carry our service from one location to our new location. New location had never had Comcast service therefore they had to do site inspection. This was last week 8/14, never heard from anyone. Called back yesterday to check status and place order. They took our order but could not give install date. Stated someone would be in contact with us for date. After waiting 24 hours called in and after speaking with 5 different people was told again it would be 24 hours before they can give a install date. We have over 2 hours involved in trying to give this company our business until finally telling them to cancel our order. We was prepared to sign 2 year contract of a monthly revenue of $160 month. Seems with their lack of concern of our service they don't need our business. I will never use Comcast again and trust me every person I hear that needs cable will hear this story in full. Hello DirecTV or AT&T.
__label__1 Set up installation appointment for technician to come out and install service. No one called or showed up. Called them and they stated no technician appointment was setup they only turned on the cable. They lied because why would they have told me between 10:00am and 12:00 to answer the phone because tech will not show up if you dont answer the phone. Waited for tech to call or show up and he didnt do either. Why would someone turn on the cable knowing you have no boxes to hook up too? Comcast your customer service people tell lies and do you care enough to do anything about it?
__label__1 Number one - could not understand the representative. Number 2 - had it installed today, nothing is working. Can't change anything - tells me try later.
__label__1 We have had Comcast since October of 2010.  However, for the first month, our internet did not work.  And it was turned off in December for copyright infringement.  The installer did not set up security on our modem.  Because someone hacked into our system, we got no signal from the beginning of October through November.  We were reimbursed for this month by Comcast.  Then, we received a call stating we were under copyright violation as they noted several French movies downloaded!  We don't even speak French and had not been able to get online!  After calling the tech support and their inadequate third party security company, it was discovered that our system was hacked and a security code was placed on the modem.  It was easy enough. In September of this year (2011), we received a phone call stating we had gone over our bandwidth, and again we were facing a copyright infringement.  What they did not know was our modem had been struck by lightning in March of 2011, and was deemed "nonworking".  Yet, no one came out to exchange it.  We were able to get online just slowly.  But as we had had a son with health issues, honestly the internet connection was the last thing on our minds at the time.  However, according to Comcast, we downloaded 2T of information from August 1 to the 31st.  It is way impossible.  Those IT and tech geeks out there know how much information that is, as well as how hard that would be, considering we had little to no connection! I called their security department again.  I told them there was no way we did this.  He suggested we change our security information again.  It appeared, with all of the usage, that more than one computer was involved.  So, we did.  Now, we have been served a subpoena regarding a copy right infringement from AF Holdings that supposedly happened on April 9, 2011.  It does not state what content was supposedly downloaded.  As a consumer and a defendant, this information is supposed to be made available to me.  I have the right to know what I am being accused of and the details of that accusation.  In addition, as stated earlier in this complaint, our modem was struck by lightning and we had virtually no connection.  According to the security department, they cannot prove or disprove our system was hacked, only that our IP was used to do it.  Well, I may not be the sharpest tech tool in the shed.  But shouldn't Comcast, if they are going to incorporate these security measures, at least have the technology to see if the information is being routed to another computer.  I feel that since they cannot "prove or disprove" hacking, they have no right to cause this stress on its customers that pay more than they should for internet.  I will be filing a formal complaint with the FTC and the BBB.  I will also contact a good attorney that may want to make a name for themselves and try to incorporate a class action suit against Comcast.  It is for falsely claiming to provide security and falsely accusing its customers of illegal practices without adequate proof to back that up.  For the record, prior to Comcast service, we had AT&T.  They were able to show us on 3 different occasions that our internet was being hacked and give the name of the modem using our connection!
__label__5 We record some political commentary programs each evening. About once a week, recording of one commentary on MSNBC fails - it doesn't record. Last night the program seemed interesting so we went to the On Demand section to see the show after it completed. MSNBC was nowhere to be found. After some time on the phone with Comcast Xfinity service, we could not find MSNBC - concluded the Democratic leaning stations were omitted. This can't be true. What did we do wrong?
__label__1 I replaced my Comcast modem with one I purchased from Best Buy over a year ago. When I installed mine, they had me call in to give them the model number, etc. They also said I had to return the Comcast modem to a service center which I did. About six months later I noticed the rental charge still on my bill so I called in to get it taken off. The guy I spoke with was very nice and said they would investigate and call me back within two to three days. No call back and I forgot about it until now and see they are still charging me for a rental. So called again and now they want me to go back to the service center with the receipt for the modem I purchased over a year ago! They will then "investigate" and remove charges. Really... I've been a customer of Comcast since 1998 and have had issues with them before but now they are telling me they don't care anymore. Just the aggravation of having to drive there again, wait in line and prove to them that I bought the modem. I asked the Comcast rep if there was someone I could speak with that could resolve this issue and she said no, I had to go to the center. I think Comcast has lost the idea that customers are number one and they've gotten too big to handle stuff like this. It's very disappointing but DirecTV, here I come.
__label__1 I got Comcast when I moved to my new apartment in Sept 2014. I switched from AT&T because my AT&T bill went too high and I wanted to have my internet-cable within the budget. I called Comcast and spoke to a customer rep who first promised a flat $39 rate and no charges for installation or technician services. Besides I was offered a 50GB internet as part of the deal. I was OK with the service although my internet was very unstable and slow but I believed it was my building that was slowing down the signal. It took me for surprise when I got my bill with charges for $40 for technician, moreover I realized that I never got the 50GB but instead 25GB. I called approximately to complain and they didn't do anything to fix my bill. They offered me to increase my internet from 25 to 50GB at not cost. Never happened. What they did is charged me $10.00 every month for a service I never got. Every month I have to call to ask to correct the bill. I will switch to any provider in a short time frame.
__label__5 I was a customer with Comcast. They lied about the discount. Was suppose to have someone do the work so I could get internet service, but he didn't do the work. So, they had to send a tech over after I waited for service for four days. They said there would be no charge for the tech coming out since it was their fault that my service was not ready. Wrong! They charged me for everything. They gave me a discount for 12 months then automatically signed me up for the next year without my consent. The bill was getting higher and higher so I called them. The customer service person told me that the discount they gave me for the past twelve months was added to my bill and each month they charged extra until it was paid. How can these people get away with this? It is as though no one can stop these crooks from their crooked business dealings. I need an internet service. All of them are liars and crooks!!!
__label__0 I have been a Comcast customer for more than 10 years. Comcast has been advertising for over a year about the transition to digital TV and advising customers who have cable that we will receive the digital signal with no interruptions and no extra cost. Now this past October 2009, I was required to get a model DC50X digital box for my cable-ready TV to receive basic signal as have all the people in my area. I have learned from my own experience and one of their own contract technicians that Comcast has been fraudulently billing customers for the latest, now required box. Here's how it goes: They ship out up to two of the boxes free and the customer installs it. Very simple - two wires and a power cord. When you call for a signal, the box won't activate. Comcast sends a tech out, who merely makes a phone call back to Comcast, and it's up and running. Then the customer gets billed $50 to $70 for what they call a failed customer install! In my case, I had other service issues not related to this. I hadn't even installed my boxes at this time and they still billed me for this failed customer install. Comcast is clearly defrauding customers with this latest effort to recoup money for hardware we never should have needed in the first place. Now they want the customer to pay for the fix.
__label__0 In December I moved into this new apt. and signed up for Comcast Cable. After the first month I received a bill for over $400.00 dollars for cable and about 100 ***** movies that were billed to me. I immediately called and complained that I just started this service and that I did not charge all these movies. I have been on hold for 15 minutes at a time and sent to another customer service person who is supposed to be a supervisor. They are like talking to a brick wall.  They have hung up on me several times. I have proof that my room mate and I were at work when all these took place. Then I got the bill the next month, and now the bill is over $500.00 with more movies. Again I called and spoke to a supervisor. They said I did it, and I need to pay.  They hung up on me. I have chatted on line, and they disconnected me. Of course I have canceled the service. I have called about 10 times, and no one will listen to me and resolve this issue. I am not paying for something I did not do. One time when I did speak with a rep, they gave me a different phone# than mine--a 510 area code and I am a 408 area code--so I believe they know there is a mistake and don't want to credit my acct. This is how they make so much money. I am so frustrated.  They are ruining my credit rating and my reputation. I have seen so many complaints about this same issue. I think there needs to be a lawsuit against them for scamming people.
__label__1 Had an installer (in Comcast uniform) come out, run cable and install internet. Having had negative experiences in the past, I expressed my trepidation about even going with Comcast again. I was promised free installation and high speed internet for $49 a month (for six months). I pushed for a straightforward total monthly amount to get up and running. He said it would be $100 deposit up front and $56 a month after that. Every month since, I have been getting bills for $175+. When I argue the point with them, they will suddenly come up with a few, "Oh, I see what happened, let me fix that" and knock of a few dollars, explaining that the deposit we paid went to installation fees (free installation) or that there were also rental fees, bringing the monthly bill to $63. These ** people sat on the phone with me for over an hour, offering one BS excuse after another, intentionally obscuring the point that they were overcharging, apparently with no intentions of crediting MY money back to me. I feel there needs to be an investigation into the practices of this corporate behemoth and someone held accountable as everyone I know has had similar experiences with them.
__label__0 I was a Comcast's customer for years, after it took over Florida Cablevision. What first got my attention was how programs were shifted around to different 'tiers', meaning I'd have to pay more to watch programs I had previously gotten with my account. I also had to take a ton of sports and Hispanic channels, which I had no use for. Then came the frequent increases in service costs, driving my bill up from around $60 a month to over $100.One service change came in the form of a letter, telling subscribers to pick 1 of a few bundles listed, as the company was making channel changes. No information on the bundles, including no listed costs. I had to call customer service to figure it out and basically was told I'd be paying more for the same service no matter what I did. Then, since I'm a night person, I discovered over 60% of my night time viewing channels, that used to replay the days shows, now were packed with paid programming and infomercials. So, I was paying for service that now had been reduced in quality.I did note, years ago, how easily Comcast managed to get the act of 'stealing cable' or making an illegal hookup raised from a misdemeanor to a felony. With more serious crimes about being classified as misdemeanors, I wondered how much Comcast had paid congressmen to push that law through. I liked the pay-per-view, until I discovered that I'd pay about $5.99 for a movie, only to find it being played for free on one of the prime stations 6 months later.Then the infomercials started expanding from between midnight and 6 AM to mornings until around 9 AM. I assumed Comcast made more money from them, so was going to throw them in everywhere, since, after all, they are technically a monopoly in most areas. I dumped Comcast and got AT&T. Including DSL Internet. I didn't discover until later that Comcast bought AT&T high speed Internet which was never mentioned in any of the information I read before signing up for it. Like a cancer, they seem to be spreading. Monopolies are illegal in the US, but apparently, Comcast is above the law.
__label__1 I have been with Comcast for decades, at numerous locations. Their current customer service is completely absurd. I have had at least one issues per month for the last 6 months or so. I have never received more than a few dollars credit in total. I am soooo sick of having to deal with poor service. Tomorrow I'm going to look for another option. My patience has been completely exhausted. Stick a fork in me, I'm DONE!!!!!
__label__1 I opened a retail business and chose Comcast for my business bundle three years ago. The business had to be moved two more times during the three-year period. When I spoke with a representative each time, never once did any of them inform me it was a multi-year "contract." Most egregious (the last move a year ago), without my permission, they tacked on an additional three years and just buried it in the boiler plate of the contract. Why would anybody imagine they would do this without some verbal discussion? My serious mistake was that I trusted the company. My business failed as are so many in this terrible economy and when I tried to discontinue service, I was informed I signed the contract and that I am liable for two more years - to the tune of almost $3,000.After talking to several other business owners, I have learned that Comcast representatives do not verbally warn people of what they are putting in the fine print - knowing most people trust and do not read those multi-page contracts - and that is what they bank on. Entrapment. Comcast is horrendously unethical, sneaky and downright criminal in their behavior and policy. These policies should be verbally relayed to potential customers so that they can make a rational decision. No business can guarantee they will be in business for several years. Had I known what they were doing, I never would have signed up.
__label__0 When I moved to Florida, I needed High Speed Internet, and contacted Comcast. I talked with a sales representative who sold me on high speed internet only, for $33 a month for 12 months with free installation. When the technician came, they gave me an official Comcast pink install receipt which showed under special instructions the following: "HSD only $33.00 12/month free install." Since I've had problems with Comcast before, I kept the pink slip. My first bill came correctly, charging me $33. My next bill charged me $59.95. I called in and was told that a "Billing Specialist" had reviewed my order and found that there was no code that allowed me a $33 special. So, without contacting me, the "billing specialist" had changed my bill to $59.95 a month. I wasn't allowed to talk to the "billing specialist. " I was only allowed to talk to the customer care rep, or could talk to a supervisor who couldn't do anything. I was told I had to request an "audit" of my account. Of course, the customer care rep had no copy of my original install receipt, and couldn't obtain one. I was told that I would get no call from a billing specialist, and to call back in a week to see if there had been any change to my account.A little over a week later, my internet service was shut off. I had to waste over an hour driving to a Comcast office with my paperwork. I showed the Comcast rep my install receipt and she agreed that it said I should be paying only $33 a month for 12 months, but couldn't find the "code" to allow me to do this. I had to wait while she called the sales rep. After she was done, she told me the sales rep would call me to straighten things out. She made a photocopy of my install paperwork and requested a second audit. The Comcast rep admitted to me that this happens all the time. Sales reps quote an introductory price, and then change the up the price without notifying the customer and make it almost impossible to get your introductory offer honored. If I couldn't find my installation pink slip, I wouldn't even have any proof of the introductory offer. I call this a scsm! 
__label__1 I have to admit, comcast had us hooked for the first month. We bought a faster internet package; our DL speeds were sometimes faster than advertised! But after a month or two, that was no longer the case. From 50Mbps to around 10Mbps on good days and with very high ping, I tried to have customer support help us. One even told us that "6Mbps is included in your package". What!? The customer support is marginal, but cannot fix the problem. Right now, we are paying for a service that we are not receiving. Comcast, please pay more attention to your customers.
__label__1 My call dropped at least 10 times in 2 days. All operators refused to allow me to talk to a supervisor. They said they would make corrections to my bill and never did. They transferred me to other departments and individuals without telling me. Operator scripting prevented an intelligent scripting. I had to pay off a bill even though they had more than enough money in a closed account that I wanted them to apply.
__label__1 I have had COMCAST/XFINITY for just twelve months. The entire time has been a nightmare to say the least. Today, I am out of service completely - TV, Internet, Phone. I have been since Sunday. No one can come until Thursday which means 5 days with NO service. I have called repeatedly. Gone through all the self-help steps. I got a call yesterday that they would expedite my service call. Lady who didn't speak English called me back and said oops we can't come any sooner. I can't see how ALL the technicians in my area of Virginia are busy for 5 days. Unless the service is crap, true. I have had 15 services outages and service calls in 12 months. I have never been given a consideration for days I was out. Instead one time I was charged $70 for the service. Took two days and 6 hours on phone for credit. I have been disconnected without notice. I made a payment arrangement, paid what rep told me too and got turned off.I called back and did chat at same time. It took three hours + to talk to someone. I was told NO ONE there or in the company could change the due date or extend it two days. It was not possible in system. No supervisor or anyone to talk to there. I was turned off for $43.00. Once I paid the $43.00 it came on instantly. I have had service in past with DirecTV, Dish and Shentel. I HAVE NEVER had such poor service. Customer Service or Reception service. I had DISH when the dishes were 8 feet in diameter and you had a little box that prompted it to turn on axis. NEVER any issues. Customer service to this day is excellent. I have the service still in my second home. I had SHELTEL for 4 years and they are small entity. No lack of service.So what the heck is wrong with COMCAST? They have no reps on phone that can help. No technicians that can come repair you and if they do they don't get it right the first time. You hold on phone for hours to be disconnected. You wait for days and service is still poor. I am not sure where these complaints go but I am continuing on to the FCC and BBB. From there maybe the top guys can be alerted to the poor service their company gives. Believe me I would send their stuff back if not for the complex I am in does not allow other services. Good luck people.

__label__1 Comcast is the worst recently! My first complaint is they quote you for a package and the bill is consistently higher than the quote (NEVER LOWER)! Buyer Beware!!! Plus I barely can understand the customer service rep - always farmed out overseas... Second I upgraded to the X1 package and had to wait a week for the appointment (which I can deal with). In the interim they somehow disconnected serve on 3 TVS! I ended up wasting 2 hours with a customer service rep to reactivate those TVS. I'm not sure about you, but I don't have 2 extra hours to waste on their mistake - I complained - NO COMPENSATION for my 2 hours that I will never get back.Third finally the day arrived when I get my upgrade - I had an appointment time of 11AM-1PM TODAY. When 1:00 PM came and no one showed up I called the 1-800-COMCAST number and a robotic voice said my appointment was 1-3PM. When I tried to talk to someone to inquire why the time was changed I was told the appointment was cancelled and is scheduled for next week- UGGGHHHHH - REALLY!?? Another 2 hours I will never get back!!!
__label__1 I called Comcast to schedule an appointment for a tech to come out and install wireless Internet for my parents. The service rep stated a one-time flat fee of $25 on the bill would be applied. The day the technician showed up, he said there was a $49.95 charge for installation of WiFi - I said we were not told that when I placed the order. He said that most people are not told. Well, what can you do? We needed the service so we said okay. He was there 4 hours and changed out 2 modems - we had WiFi but only in a few rooms and then the cable was knocked out in two bedrooms.My mother who is retired and on a fixed income called Comcast to ask about the fees and she was given an 800 number where she did have her call answered by someone outside the US. She was frustrated that no one would help her. So I called them and I also was sent to a number and the lady said she was in Asia. I said, "Where are you?" She said, "the Philippines." I said, "How do I reach a main office in Atlanta?" She said, "Well, let me transfer you and see where you wind up."I got connected to a lady in Tennessee and she couldn't give me a local office or email address and told me to go back to the store where you turn in equipment and lodge a formal complaint. So I went to the local Douglasville office and she said, "We don't have complaint forms," but that she would email her boss. This lady was the first person I had talked to in 3 days that even cared. It was a relief.How can Comcast offer services and not disclose all fees at the time you place an order? It has been 3 days and order was not complete and nobody cared. I was given the customer service rep's codes or IS numbers so if I can find where I can actually file a complaint in the United States, I would love to. Why do we get transferred to a number that is out of our country and they have all our information? Our home number, social security number, address? This is the poorest of service and I am saddened that my 70-year-old parents had to go through this experience. And we wonder why we have no jobs available to us?How does the FCC (or whoever regulates) or rather why do they let a company route service calls or questions to another country? How does that help me here in Georgia? It doesn't.
__label__1 I am beyond dissatisfied with this company. My husband and I have had them about a month now and have nothing but problems. Our internet doesn't work half the time and it tells me I have limited access. I have tried both WiFi and hard wire to connect. I have had three techs out to see what the issue is, and nothing has been resolved. We tried two different modems that we bought ourselves and they continuously told us that it was our modem. We now switched to their modem and still no success. I am sick of them making excuses as to why they cannot get their own products to work. I have been on the phone with them for hours and am five minutes away from switching to someone else. This is ridiculous. I would not recommend them to anyone.
__label__1 We installed Xfinity XF Bundle 3-4 months ago. At the time of the sales call we were told there would be no installation fee. When we received the bill there was a $60 service fee. When I called to question the fee I was told that was the installation fee for the phone! I already had a phone, I was only changing the internet and cable box! They would not waive the fee. We were watching TV on a Saturday night last month and the cable box completely went out. I called customer service and was told that they would have to send a technician out that we could not take the box in to an office and change it out since it was the XF box! I again was told that there would be no charge. I get my bill and there is a $70 charge! Again I called customer service disputing the charge, they wanted to upsell me to add $4.95 to my account for maintenance fee! I am already paying $236 a month for service that is horrible. Our internet goes out all the time and is slower than the regular cable we had before! I was told that a manager would have to review the phone call (the original service call recording that I made to Xfinity) to see if that was in fact what they said! I called back 4 days later and still the issue has not been resolved. I was disconnected twice and finally gave up. Xfinity gives horrible customer service, you are lucky if you get someone that speaks clear English. I want my $70 credit and then I am looking for a new cable company even if I have to pay $200 to get out of our 2 year contract.
__label__1 I had internet set up with Comcast in my new apartment and before the technician left, he said that it may be a bit slow until it finished its updates. Not only was it slow, but it would not connect to my Roku at all (however, the wifi hotspot on my phone did without any issue or delay). In the midst of that, I had called inquiring about cable but decided that $137 was too steep for me and the internet service continued to decline in quality.I made between 6-8 calls to Comcast over the next 2 days attempting to resolve the issue. Twice the call was disconnected and I was not called back, once I was told that there would be a service charge between $25-50, once I was told there was nothing wrong with the unit (over the phone), once I was told that they would waive the fee (which was then $40, not the $25-50 the previous rep had said) and once I requested a supervisor's assistance to which I was told that all supervisors were in a meeting and one would call me back in 30 minutes - that also never happened.I finally got fed up with the whole thing and cancelled after 3 days and was told that I had to return the equipment to a UPS store to avoid being charged for it. The next day, I received a box with a security camera and a cable modem! I went online to my account, and guess who had added additional services to my account without my consent - COMCAST! I called and they tried to smooth it over by saying that the package was sent, but there was no plan set up for it on my account. "Then why is it listed as a service on my online account page?" I asked. I was told that they didn't know, but they didn't show it in their system. I cancelled my account and took all of their equipment back to UPS that day. I've never received such horrible service in my life - and I was only a customer for 3 days.
__label__1 I need to have Comcast explain my concern(s) for their abusive billing practices and why there has been no effort made to date to "properly address" or produce a "reasonable solution" which include my concerns for Comcast's repeated uses of:3) And I need to find out why Comcast is allowed and continues to be "allowed", to be the only Cable TV provider & "Monopoly" in the Chico area, as well as obviously in other areas, and not allow others/competition (e.g. Charter, Frontier, and the other Best Northern California, CA Cable TV Providers and the like...) to compete and thus to comply with the federal Fair Trade Act.
__label__0 Comcast had a promotion whereas if you signed up for cable services, you would get $150.00 in gas.  I signed up and then was sent a voucher to submit either by mail or online to GotGasPromo.com.  I was to enter the promo code given and choose a gas station vendor to purchase gas from and I had to save up $100.00 a month in gas receipts and send them in.  I was then supposed to receive $25.00 a month for 6 months as long as I sent in my receipts by the end of the last day of the month.  Well, I never received the monthly coupons that were supposed to be turned in with the receipts.  I called the number listed in the letter I received and once again requested the coupons, I have yet to receive them.  This is very suspicious and misleading by Comcast and GotGasPromo.  I have yet to receive any "free" gas. 
__label__5 I woke up this morning perfectly content with the new service agreement I made with COMCAST last week. Then today, an agent called me, and promised me more service for less money. I don't care about "more service", but I like "less money", so I agreed. Then I noticed there were fewer channels, the service they added is something I don't even want, and the monthly price was higher!Long story short... I ended up spending my afternoon on the phone with multiple reps (mostly on hold), just trying to get back what I had, when I woke up this morning. The result - I have to pay even MORE, and was called a complainer.... I was content this morning. THEY called ME. I have been a loyal customer of Comcast for years. They do not appreciate my business. I am not happy with COMCAST. I don't recommend using Comcast if you have another option... any other option.
__label__0 On Oct 22 rec a disconnection notice for a missed Sep payment. The pymt was sent on 9-22 and was processed by comact on 9-30 the pymt was paid on from my mother's account like is has been for over 5yrs now. On Oct 22,24 and 27 I had to fax over the front and back of the check to Danica, Kimberly, and Freda. The check was cashed by not applied to the acct because my mom put a partial acct number on the check, but it was mailed with Comcast stub with the entire acct number on it. My cable was shut off on Thurs Oct 30 and today is the 31st my cable is still off, I have recieved nothing but rude service from Barbra and Sam. I'm paying for a service that I am not receiving, and no one is trying to rectify the situation
__label__1 The customer service rep was so rude and indifferent. I felt as though the 45 minutes I wasted on the phone being bullied and belittled was unforgivable. I have only been a customer for 2 months! THIS IS NOT RIGHT! I will never recommend this service and as soon as I can cancel and move to a different company I will be doing so.
__label__0 My name is Kenneth ** and I am the President of a fairly large electrical contracting company that currently resides in Worcester Massachusetts. The name of our company is New Horizons Technologies Inc. The current address of our company is in Worcester, but we have recently purchased a new place of business that is located at ** in Sterling Massachusetts. We closed on this new property on November 19th, 2010. Since purchasing this property, we have completely renovated it, bringing the office space up to date, improving the exterior of the buildings and upgrading all of the utilities, and systems at this location. We have basically taken an old historic former rail station, then Lumber yard and brought it back to life with a new found character and meaning to the town of Sterling and the neighbor hood it is located in. When done we will have spent over Four Hundred Thousand Dollars on this place to make it a modern, functional, thriving place of business.The Town of Sterling has been wonderful to deal with including the Building Departments, Inspectional Services, Fire Department, and local utilities. They have been very accommodating and a pleasure to work with. They understand the value of a company like us moving in and updating a property such as this and what it brings to the community. Us moving into a location like this adds value to all of the real estate around us because of how we increased the value of this property, it helps the other local businesses in the area with increased volume of business because of the 70 employees we bring to the area to do business in that area. We hope to continue to grow and provide opportunity for additional hires from this area to add to our work force.This Recession and current economy have been very hard on small businesses like ours as you very well aware. I have been doing this for over 23 years now and this is by far the worst period I have ever seen. To be honest, I am not even sure our business model even works now with the new set of rules that are out there to compete in this economy, but we are trying our best to survive and to make it to the end of this period. We actually had a decent 2010 so , we decided to invest in property and to stop renting and hopefully 2010 was an indicator of things to come. So we bought the property in Sterling and hoped to make this our new home to take us into the next decade and help with setting us up to be prosperous into the next decade.The purpose for this letter is to inform you, and also ask for your help in dealing with Comcast. We have electricity, we have gas, we have phone service, but we have no internet service. The only player in town is Comcast and our hands are tied. We can only deal with them. We first contacted them on February 28th, one month ago today. We are planning on moving into our new office this Friday April 1st at the close of business on that day and opening for business on Monday April 4th. They are now telling us we will not have internet service for approximately another 3 weeks. We have documented all phone calls and internet dealings with them. They have been totally slow, unresponsive, and non-caring about our situation. Basically treating us like a number and could care less about our situation. I have no idea if there are more complaints, many complaints or no complaints about Comcast and their service, but I feel I needed to write you and every other person in politics and the media who might listen. I have been totally shocked to find out that it takes 6 to 8 weeks to get internet service to a business line ours in the town of Sterling. We deal with municipalities all the time. Getting power, telephone and internet service for our clients. We know the routine, we know the pitfalls and the steps needed, but dealing with Comcast has been the worst. Just totally unresponsive to our needs and time frame.They need to run a cable 700 from where it is currently dead ended on the street. They say that is one of the reasons they cannot do it quickly because they need to schedule that part to get that wire strung on the poles. The other is they say they need a police detail. I tell them that we know what it takes to string a cable 700, and we know what it takes to get a police detail and both can happen very easily with a little bit of effort. They do this every day all day. They prefer to put up barriers instead of removing them. They prefer to stop business instead of helping it.Basically, I read all the time about how politicians talk about providing jobs, helping small business to succeed, to provide an atmosphere where businesses can prosper so they can hire new employees. Everyday I see on the news how it is so important to get America back on its feet, to get people back to work, to buy properties and help out neighbor hoods they are located in. To get the most important segment of our industry hiring again, which is small businesses. Well, here is a perfect situation. We have done everything with out no kick backs or buy outs from the governments, no tax credits and no assistance what so ever. I just need Comcast to give us internet service. They were given this monopoly by our government and now they stand in the way of business progressing. This is just not right. We are not a 100 billion dollar bank, insurance company, or car manufacturer, we are an 8 million dollar a year small business trying to survive.Technology is so very important to our business and every business out there. I keep hearing that the government wants the internet brought to every household in the country. Well, we use it and need it and cannot run with out it. The impact to our business is in the tens of thousands with out it. If the government is going to give these companies a monopoly in these towns, the government needs to apply pressure to these companies when they are not serving the good of the community.Hopefully there is something that can be done here. Business as usual with Comcast needs to stop. Maybe we cannot be helped, but others may be able to be in the future.
__label__1 It is quite insulting to be told to be fair in the account, when their customer service representatives have been nothing but fair!!! In addition, 'Angry' in the rating is an understatement. I am beside myself that I was transferred over 9 times!!! I spent a total of 5.5 hours on the phone until I finally got a supervisor, who was not understanding at all, but was able to explain that it was my property management company that I needed to speak to for services. This is great info, if I would have received it from the 1st rep, not after 5 hours of being on the phone and speaking to the 9th rep. Overall, this is the worst service I have ever received; the reps don't know anything about other departments and do not follow through. They are happy to transfer as soon as they can. Certainly they do not go above and beyond. They are unwilling to help and incompetent! When I asked the supervisor what he can do for me as I just spent 5 hours over 2 days on the phone with them wasting my time and energy, the supervisor said he cannot do anything at all. Truthfully, I can't blame the individuals, only the company for not giving them the training or the tools to help potential clients. Extremely disappointed and livid about my experience with Comcast!!!
__label__1 I am writing to let you know of an issue I'm having with Comcast Customer Service. Please bear in mind, I've been a customer for 3 days. Roughly an hour after the install, my service was intermittent and the phone support folks were not able to help and suggested sending someone out to my home. Now, the appointment was scheduled for today (28 Feb 2012) between 6-7 PM. The tech didn't show and claimed I wasn't home. This is demonstrably false, I've been sitting here since 5:30 PM, waiting. No phone call, door bell ring, nothing. This is upsetting to me.I had to leave work early to get home for the appointment and that isn't easy to do. I also depend on the service which, at the moment, isn't working. Not only did the tech lie to his boss, he put me out as well. I expect a higher level of service from you and am very disappointed.
__label__0 Ive been without phone service for about a week now. I went through all the steps for activation. I have also talked to a manager about the situation. A tech was ordered Monday and Wednesday. No one came the first time; the second my order was cancelled minutes before the time when were to be at my home. I pay a lot for the tripe play and I have to go without service for a week. This is crazy. I have a business and most of my clients call, plus I have kids. If anything were to happen, they have no phone to call 911. A phone is really a big thing for me and I need it to work. One of my children is a special needs child; we need doctor appointments on a regular and constant commutation with their school. 
__label__1 Service is a joke. Have tried to establish internet service. However, discovered Comcast did not acknowledge my payment, therefore flagging an unpaid balance. Prior service was 4 years ago, payment in full to collection agency 1 year ago but still unable to establish service. Phone conversations, emails, faxed documentation, voice messages to no avail in past 6 weeks. Today, devoted time to resolving. However, was disconnected 4 times, spent 1 hour on hold (placed on hold 10 times), spoke with 8 different employees, each time explaining my problem, providing my phone number, address, and last 4 of my social. Called 2 different numbers. A third I was given was wrong, a recorded message for Chevy cha-cha??? Unable to provide call back number to speak with same person again and was told I would need to discuss with the originator 'of the ticket' who wasn't working today and person I spoke with was going on vacation. Requested another fax of proof of payment and referred back to debt collector. Really? Monopolize the area and treat customers this way? I paid my debt a year ago, recovered financially and bought a new home, now cannot even get internet. Such a shame to be treated this way.
__label__1 I had the worst customer service with Comcast. I spend many hours to solve a little issue as transferring one account to another. C customer service hanged up on me when asked to talk with a supervisor.
__label__0 They overcharged me for the move of service from one residence to another. Website says free movement of service but $141.80 was charged for the move. I called the company and the lady argued with me that I agreed to the cost of the move and upgrades to my service.
__label__0 We have been customers of Comcast and their affiliates for well over 10 years. They are constantly the only service in the area (which is a monopoly and highly illegal) and they exploit that fact to their fullest extent. The service is poor at best. When there is an outage in the area, they know this as it is logged in their system. This means that their system should automatically issue a day's credit for the service that we couldn't receive. Do you think they would actually do that? Not a chance! When the billing arrives, there is no clear way to understand the billing with all of their 'taxes and fees' that they attach to our bill. You would have to have a 6-year Degree in Economics to even attempt to understand what they are actually charging (not kidding). When you first sign up, they offer you a 'promotional price' that is either six, 12 or 24 months. However, they do not state the length or amount of the promotion remaining on your bill at any time. This means that when you see a bill that is 50% higher than it was the month before, you would understandably freak out. When you call them, they give nothing but excuses, say that they can't give you another promotion for 90 days and that you would have to pay full price for 90 days. And then, they would look into what packages they could offer you at that time. While doing so, they attempt to transfer you many times to someone who has no idea of what they're doing if it is not in their script to read to you. Everything from outright lies, to blaming the customer and claiming that everything is computer-automated and that there's nothing they can do about your issues. In other businesses, you receive price breaks the longer you are with the company in question. For example, if you are a customer for 2 years, you would receive a certain percentage off of your bill. If you are a customer for 5 years, you would receive a larger discount. What they are doing is giving you one price to get you in the door and then raise the price at will after that. In any other business, this is called, 'bait and switch' and is highly illegal in our state. If you, as a customer, contact any company with an issue, they would bend over backwards to do anything to satisfy you in following the old adage, 'The customer is always right.' Does Comcast follow the same adage? Obviously not. That's why you are reading this post. We have done some research and have some numbers for you if you are in Pennsylvania. To contact Comcast's Philadelphia office, you would call 1-(215) 665-1700. Ask to speak to Brian Roberts (COO) or his assistants. If that does no good, consider contacting the United States Department of Consumer Protection. The Harrisburg office is at 1-800-441-2555. If you are not living in Pennsylvania, a quick Google search should give you the local corporate office for Comcast and then also the Department of Consumer Affairs. We could all join together as one voice and tell Comcast once and for all that they are not allowed to treat us the way that they have been and we will not allow it to happen anymore.
__label__1 I have dealt with plenty of Comcast's/Xfinity customer service and technicians over the years. Yes, there were plenty of times where the reps were rude, not knowledgeable and I don't even want to mention getting stuck in the IVR maze and transfers. This is my first public review and complaint about them until today. Today their negligence and complete disregard for their customers pushed me over the edge. We manage IT services for many companies and municipalities and utilize Comcast for transport and service where needed. We deal with Comcast customer service on almost a daily basis.It all started this morning when I received a message from one of our customers that the internet is down. I thought well nothing unusual since outages are a common problem for the area where the customer has service. I called Comcast Business Class Customer service at 800-391-300 (forgot to mention this is business class service) to see if there were any outages. Before I was able to speak with a rep, I received a text from my customer informing me the service came back on. IVR did not report any outages in the area either during my call. The outage in the morning lasted a whole 4 minutes, not long but for a business that does online sales, very annoying. When 12:10 CT came around, I received another text from my customer reporting again the service is out. So as before I picked up the phone and dialed the CSR number, but this time when the rep answered, I was informed my account was disconnected. I was in shock, asking how is this possible, the rep informed me that it was a voluntary disconcertion. Raising my voice out of anger, I demanded an explanation and was told this morning I requested the service to be disconnected. On top of it all, she stated there is a note that I called in January of 2015 inquiring if there is a contract on the account. I'm the only one that is authorized to make changes to the account and never did I even call to inquire about the contract term. The service at this location was active for over two years. I have stories collected over the years about Comcast, billing mistakes, modems being accidentally removed and deactivated, unauthorized charges, etc. If I had to count all the hours wasted dealing with them, it would add up to months and not to mention all the stress and aggravation dealing with this company. Thank you for taking the time in reading my story. The service location for this particular customer is in Bensenville IL, in the commercial park near York Rd and Foster.
__label__1 Had no phone or internet service for 4 days. Comcast gave me 4 appointments. Either no tech showed and I was told 2 of my appointment was scheduled unsuccessfully. Comcast reps scheduled the appt therefore it's their fault if the appt was scheduled unsuccessfully. I missed 3 days of work because they had me waiting on a tech each day from 9-4. One day from 8-4. When my service is finally restored I called Comcast to get credited for those days I didn't have service. They only credited me 50.00. I was told earlier in the week it would be 20 for each missed appt.Comcast is full of **!!! I missed out on hundreds of dollars in wages and they wouldn't even credit me what they said they were because their reps didn't put all the appts in the system. I asked them aren't the calls recorded just to verify the appts their reps gave me? They said yes but they didn't have access to the recordings. Wow!!!
__label__1 1. When you set up the alarm system and ask several times if this is a contract and they say no, DO NO BELIEVE THEM. The alarm system is a piece of garbage. When it goes off, you get no response from Comcast. 2. My home phone has been out since the end of August. They have attempted to correct the problem several times to no avail. They have sent out a tech, told me it was an issue in their office, etc. The phone works for about 24 hours and then nothing. When you call my home, the phone goes straight to voice mail. If you attempt to make a call, you get a busy signal. I wish that my cell phone worked inside my home because I would disconnect this service with quickness. I am now looking for new phone service. Don't even try to call and ask for a supervisor because they are always unavailable.
__label__0 Today, I lost my phone service and internet access for 12 hours. I live in the woods and my cell has no bars. I am 63 and need this service I pay for. Every time I get a bill, the price goes up and the service goes down. This has happened 3 times this month.
__label__1 I tried Comcast under the 30 day free trial. The service did work well! But for other reasons I cancelled the account within the 30 day period. Their technician came out to take back the equipment - so far so good. But they kept billing me, and now have turned the 'free, no obligation, nothing owed' bill over to a collection agency. I have had no less than 3 people at Comcast who all assured me that they can and will fix this problem, but I continue to get calls. The collection agency tells me that I owe Comcast money, Comcast tells me I don't owe anything. It just shouldn't be this hard. They obviously still do not care about customer service - how hard can it be to fix this problem???
__label__0 Channel 65 did not work since about August 1, 2008 on all non-cable box TVs
Low or no signals since September 15, 2008.
Technicians at house about once a week since October 1, 2008.
Specific Dates
In October, a technician came to the house and put am amplifier on the front of the house to boost the signal. The problems were not solved.
Later in October, a technician named Courtney came to the house and said that the signal from the street on the drop? was 6 over 20" and that this was way out of range. He said that it should be close to 10 over 12". He said that he reported this to another division of Comcast for them to come out and fix the street signals. He said that he had no idea when they might come out since that was a different department.
At some point in time, an amplifier was placed on front on house. Various technicians who came later during weekly visits decided that the amp messed up the internet connection and/or made signals bad to inside house. Intermittent problems included no signals, weak signals ( boxes on screen), One Moment Please? on various channels, especially the higher numbers on front of house TV and intermittent weak or no signal to garage.
Around November 8, 2008, technician determined that the signal to the TV in the garage was weak due to line problems from front of house to garage. Outside contractor work order was generated for Integral Development Solutions to rewire to garage on November 11, 2008..
November 11, 2008 Integral technician found multiple unapproved connections and splitters?, removed amplifier and rewired front of house where line comes from street.. Rewire to garage not done. Front of house box restored to apparent normal reception. Back of house remains with reception with boxes on screen or dead on higher numbered channels.
November 16, 2008 technician Danny came to house again and determines that line from front of the hosue to garage needs to be rewired. Danny calls supervisor trying to describe physical layout of house, wires and garage and not able to do so. Danny has supervisor arrange for the head technician? to be at my house on November 19, 2008 between 2-5 p.m.

He noted that entire the house needed to be rewired with one line going from the first splitter at the  to the garage without a break for the internet modem. He noted that there were way too many splitters that weakened signal from the front. He placed an order for a complete rewire and said that we would be called and he could not set the appointment. He also stated that the signal from the street pole was still 6 over 20" and that this was supposed to have been fixed by a different crew a long time ago.
Around 6:35 p.m. on November 30, 2008, I received a call from a Comcast person who said that some one was coming to the house right away tonight. I gave my telephone number and the person is supposed to come out tonight.
Around 6:50 p.m. November 26, 2008 I received a call from an Integral man who said he was coming to the house. Adrian Goodlow of Integral arrived at 7:10 and stayed until about 8:20 p.m. He looked at all of the exterior and the garage box and modem and agreed that the re-wire requested by Courtny was needed. He stated that he could start around 10 a.m. Friday November 28, 2008 and that it would take about 3 hours or so.

No call from Rachael Cross. Call back at 8:44 a.m. Person said that she had a different supervisor, Terrance Marshall and I was referred to him and placed on hold to wait for Terrance. Received interruption of one moment please? at 9:51.  At 9:54, Terrance is not available? and would have to leave a voice mail for him. Had to leave voice message for Terrance at 9:55 a.m.
Tech line called again - Michael answered at 9:58 a.m. Charles Scott is his supervisor, but Charles is not at his desk right now at it. Michael says that it is possible to have a director? get information. In the history of not getting anything done, the word director? is new. Michael has to send an escalation? to the dispatch department at 10:06 a.m. Dispatch is supposed to be working on Sunday morning, but he is not sure. Escalating to dispatch at 10:14 a.m.Jeff *******November 30, 2008Later in October, a technician named Courtney came to the house and said that the signal from the street on the drop? was 6 over 20" and that this was way out of range. He said that it should be close to 10 over 12". He said that he reported this to another division of Comcast for them to come out and fix the street signals. He said that he had no idea when they might come out since that was a different department.
At some point in time, an amplifier was placed on front on house. Various technicians who came later during weekly visits decided that the amp messed up the internet connection and/or made signals bad to inside house. Intermittent problems included no signals, weak signals ( boxes on screen), One Moment Please? on various channels, especially the higher numbers on front of house TV and intermittent weak or no signal to garage.
Around November 8, 2008, technician determined that the signal to the TV in the garage was weak due to line problems from front of house to garage. Outside contractor work order was generated for Integral Development Solutions to rewire to garage on November 11, 2008..
November 11, 2008 Integral technician found multiple unapproved connections and splitters?, removed amplifier and rewired front of house where line comes from street.. Rewire to garage not done. Front of house box restored to apparent normal reception. Back of house remains with reception with boxes on screen or dead on higher numbered channels.

Courtney arrived about 3:30 p.m. He changed the drop? line from the street to the house.
He noted that entire the house needed to be rewired with one line going from the first splitter at the  to the garage without a break for the internet modem. He noted that there were way too many splitters that weakened signal from the front. He placed an order for a complete rewire and said that we would be called and he could not set the appointment. He also stated that the signal from the street pole was still 6 over 20" and that this was supposed to have been fixed by a different crew a long time ago.
Around 6:35 p.m. on November 30, 2008, I received a call from a Comcast person who said that some one was coming to the house right away tonight. I gave my telephone number and the person is supposed to come out tonight.
Around 6:50 p.m. November 26, 2008 I received a call from an Integral man who said he was coming to the house.

__label__1 Three interfaces with online chat. 1. Promised me telephone contact from higher level tech between 1-5 PM Saturday. Didn't happen. 2. Today the connection got severed. 3. Today (#2) connection broken before I could read what the last comment was.
__label__1 I received a DVR on Jan 28 2011, the tech came installed everything and by the time I came home from work, it was not working properly. All of the features on the remote did not work and the box would tell that I did not have certain access to channels and I should call xfinity. It was channel 2, it also happened with HD channels.So I called the 800 number and got a very nice customer service rep name Harold. It took him 45 minutes to zip my box so it would work, I was grateful. I came home from work the next day same problem. I called xfinity again and got Harold (to my surprise) again. Again, it took him 45 minutes to zip the box and I also informed him that the remote did not work. He tried codes for another 15 minutes (which is now 1 hour I am on the phone with him) just for him to tell me that I need a new remote. Next day same thing happened to my surprise. Guess who I get, yes Harold again (is he the only rep that works there after 6pm EST?). 45 minutes later, box working but this time said he is sending tech. He made an appointment. Technicians came on time and said they fixed the box. Two days later, same thing happened. I call xfinity again. This time, I tell them I want a new box and the CS tells me that I will be charged. I argue with him get my appointment and wait for my appointment. I get a bill before the rep comes and its outrageous. I take it to the Comcast center in Morgantown WV and they adjust it and also take off bill form service call because they see problem is not fixed. This is on February 15, 2012. She verifies my appointment for Saturday, February 18 for 2:30pm-4:30pm. Come Friday the 17th, the box pops and turns off. I call xfinity. Yet, again the rep gets it to work but no sound. 1 hour and 15 minutes later, we have picture and sound and he said hopefully it will work until my techs get there tomorrow February 18, 2012 between 2:30-4:30pm. Saturday comes no techs, no call, and no sound on TV. I call xfinity and get a rude CSR and rude manager. They first try to tell me my appointment is for the 25th when the manager at the Morgantown office and the CSR on Friday saw the appointment and on top of that, the automated system when I called verified my appointment for that day. This funky so called manager tried to insult my intelligence and tell me different and then tells me I can take time off my job and go to the office and get a new box, then tried to insult me with a $20.00 credit. I informed him that since I pay for the triple play and I dont have it I will be paying only for the internet because the box doesn't work. I don't know where they get these people from but I know one thing they say New Yorkers are rude and I from New York, and not one time have I ever had this problem with Time Warner Cable. I hope that they come to Morgantown, WV and know Comcast out the box, and there will be a lot of very grateful people. 
__label__0 I just opened a new account with Comcast for cable & internet. I have paid as agreed. This complaint concerns an online payment made on 11-8-08 for $74.07.  Comcast notified me by postcard on 11-16-08 that the payment was Reversed and that a $25.00 Reversal Fee was charged to my account.  I contacted my bank, VyStar. A representative stated that Comcast had never made a request for the $74.07! Even if the bank was mistaken, I have an automatic overdraft and the debit would have been covered.  Comcast never processed my EFT! Then they charged me $25.00 falsely, stating that the fee had been reversed by my bank.  This is an outright untruth!  I wrote a letter to Credit & Collections with the information from my bank, and requested that the $25 fee be removed.  I copied this letter in an email to Reg Griffin, vice president, communications, southern division. I requested a Read receipt. Mr. G read my email the same day it was sent.   As of this date, I have received no response from him.  The EFT payment has still not been processed by Comcast. Comcast's post card to me states that I owe $178.14, which equals two monthly payments plus the $25.00 fee.Unjust $25.00 Reversal fee; unsure of the additional monthly payment; unsure of the status of the discounts for opening my account, as they may be removed because of the supposed Reversal.
__label__0 I canceled my cable tv on 1/28/06. I was told at that time that I have acredit coming to me. I have since been contacted numerous times about my bill being deliquent. I was then told that I had called and re-instated my service. A call that I did not make. I recieved a call on 3/13/06 confirming that a credit will be issued. I recieved call on 3/14/06 saying that I was delinquent in paying my bill. I told themthat they were harrassing me and that if it continued I would contact an attorney. they are making it very hard to cancel their service.
__label__1 This has been the most frustrating and time consuming venture I have ever encountered. I am just about ready to have you come and take all of the cable equipment out of this house. #1 I called and asked for the Blast Plus package. The woman told me that that no longer existed and it was now called Internet Plus. I asked about the channels and was told that it was only 29, but I specifically asked for a package that included Hallmark. She assured me that it did.#2 Installation. The gentleman was very nice but had a very hard time getting it set up. He had to call Comcast at least 4 times. The installation took over 4 hours! I was about to start charging him rent. As soon as he left we realized this was definitely NOT the requested package. TV consisted of ABC, NBC, CBS, Many Access Channels, Many "sales" channels, and cartoons. No Hallmark. All the boxes were $10 HD boxes. HBO was supposed to be included and that apparently was the ONLY HD channel in this package. Why would anyone pay for that package?We took all the equipment out of the house and took it back to Comcast in Snellville. A nice man checked the equipment in Snellville. We told him we wanted the Blast Plus and he set us up with a package. The Blast Plus includes Hallmark and Hallmark Movie channel, this did not. It also did not include HGTV and many other channels that the real Blast Plus does include. He did not add the 2 small boxes to the account. So we had one television working while being charged for 3. I called to complain and told the person all the hassle and hours that I had been on the phone. Trying to get through has caused many disconnects. Every time someone is routing a call they hang up. I have no less than 17 phone calls trying to get this service set up. After visiting Comcast store, the account was set up and the monthly payment showed up as $79.99. Blast Plus is $59.99 He sent me to Resolutions.Resolutions talked with me and checked all the notes. He agreed that I had been put through too much. I told him all I wanted was the Blast Plus as it was advertised. He told me that he would make it better. He did not give a package name but told me it would be 120 channels, Blast internet and would be $54.95 a month. I had him repeat it three times to be sure. This switch was still not handled correctly. We have three boxes and only 2 get all the channels promised. I asked the man to send me a confirmation to my GMail account. He sent it to the Comcast account which I do not use.We have three boxes and only 2 are getting the promised channels. I called to have a signal sent to the box that is not working correctly and was told that we have 105 channels and that HGTV and Travel are not part of the package. Funny the other two Boxes do get these and many more channels. He then transferred me to Resolutions 10:30 on Saturday Night. After many minutes of "we are sorry, your call is very important to us" I ended up hearing a recording that the Resolutions Dept was closed and to call back on Monday. Now I look at the confirmation that Resolutions sent to the wrong email address and it is over $100 per month. This whole case is ridiculous as are most of your policies. I was a client for over 7 years but seeing all the deals go to "new" customers only made me mad enough that I disconnected until I could come back in as a new customer. Faithful customers should not be treated like that. Particularly ANY person should not be lied to, not once, not twice but three times (so far). I do not have a working package. If this cannot be resolved to my liking, you can pick up all the equipment and I owe NOTHING $0.00.
__label__1 Wow wow wow that's all I can say... Comcast is gone from top to rock bottom... Worst internet service ever. Even terrible than AT&T. I have signed them like 3 weeks ago and the speed I am getting is 3 to 4 mbps. I have to call the support daily and I mean daily. Only thing I hear is that "Sir we will credit you 20 since you aren't getting what you are suppose to". I mean really. My bill I checked is 311. They are freaking charging me for the tech guys who was here to fix the problem and yet nothing has been fixed. This is ** so and get SureWest. They are 1000000 times better than this suckers.
__label__1 We changed services to Comcast. The installers were not able to locate the service box and were unable to install the service. They told us their Supervisor would be there in 5 mins to conduct the installation. Two hours later (after an hour on hold), Comcast was unaware of the problem or able to see which Supervisor would be contacting us. They told us we would be contacted within 24 hrs. We explained that we needed immediate internet for our businesses, there was no sympathy for this.After waiting 24 hours, we called back. There were no notes in the system. The operator said that the nearest appt. for an installation was on March 1 (a week out). I told her that we could not wait that long and needed a response immediately. She said to give the Supervisor 48 hours to call us. I asked for his name and number, she said that she wasn't sure who would be contacting us - it wasn't assigned. I requested the $90 installation fee and days without service be waived/reimbursed. She said I would have to call back and petition after the services were fully installed.
__label__1 From the September of 2011 my TV and internet service has been off and on almost daily. I have been calling Comcast at least weekly about the problem. Well, it is two pages of all the problems I had dealing with Comcast during that 4-month period and I am sure many of you have been there anyway so there is no need to go thru the whole nightmare.Last week I gave up and filed a complaint with the state of Florida. A few days later a woman from Comcast called me. Christina ** called and gave me her name and then mumbled something and just twos were clear and it was "Comcast Executive". To her credit she listened to me for at least ten minutes that it took me to list all of the problems I was having with my Comcast service. When I was done she explained that she could only compensate me for 3 of the 4 months I had had countless problems with them. She explained that there was not any record of me calling about service problems in October 2011.This really got to me considering all the time I had wasted with Comcast on the phone and the crappy service I was receiving and paying $150 a month with no movies or sports of any kind just an HD add-on. I told Christina ** that I do not even care how much she was willing to refund me and that I was not going to lie and agree that what she said was true about October 2011. Then she offered to send out a repair truck that day which in the past few months meant waiting 6 or more hours for them to show up without even phone call. So I had to find a day that I can waste 6 hours or so. I declined.The next day the state of Florida sent me a copy of the email Christina sent them that morning and here it is:Dear Sir/Madam:This letter is in response to the complaint filed by Stephen ** on January 19, 2012, regarding a service complaint that he has had intermittent service issues.We do not have any documented service issues after the completed service call on September 30, 2011. Several offers to schedule a service call to verify claims of service issues were declined by the customer. The customer has been compensated for the documented service issues which occurred in September. A one-time credit in the amount of $25.76 has been applied to his account. He has also been given a $20.00 a Customer Guarantee credit in September for the late arrival by the service technician.We deeply apologize for the frustration this experience has placed on Mr. Peterson. In an effort to make up for his time and frustration, we have given service credit.I trust that this provides your office with the information required in this matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly at ** should you have any questions or need additional information. Comcast looks forward to receiving confirmation upon closure of case # **.Sincerely,Christina **Well, as you can see Comcast decided to punish me for not agreeing to the 3-month offer and she had set me up on, stating she will send out a service truck while she was talking to me on the phone Now I have something here that is unheard of: a direct phone number to Comcasts executives (904-374-7701). Please use it wisely. 
__label__1 I've had Comcast at my current address for the last 16 yrs. Comcast is charging me for movies that were never ordered. This has been going on for the last 3 months. Comcast had their research dept look into this issue and have credited me for the last 2 months, but are refusing to credit me the $400+ in recently charged films. The movies in question are adult films (porn) which was not ordered by me or anyone else. I've changed the modem and cable boxes twice. I also have a block on every TV along with a required pin code in order to get anything on demand. I have no children and there is no way anyone can be ordering this from inside my house. I'm a breast cancer survivor, fighting to regain my health and my life. I'm a good person and I do for others. How could this be happening to me? Please help.
__label__1 Had Comcast for years and the same thing... the bill will go up $10... few months later $20. We moved to Bellingham, Wa two years ago and set up Comcast for our internet. We set up an account and it was to be $36 a month for two years. That lasted 6 months then it went up. just found out they were charging me double what they should have been $75 a month and billing me for a cable modem that I own. I wish there was another option. It's Comcast or nothing!
__label__1 No one never told me that it is so easy getting into Comcast home security contract but hell getting out. The goal is to keep you and the contract as long they can so every little change you make to your account your home security contract starts over. Comcast it would be nice to let your customers make changes to their accounts. People's lives do change you know. I hate Comcast.
__label__1 I was laid off at work due to the slowing economy on June 24th of this year. So I contacted Comcast to see if I could lower my $158.00 a month bill. First of all, the guy talked me into accepting a promo which would cost me $176.00 a month. Well the next month, I did not receive a bill for $176.00 plus tax; I received a bill for $406.00. They made a mistake and are sticking me with the bill. I talked to a customer service and after an hour of arguing, they forced me to accept a bill of $247.76 which I paid even though I should not have had to. They waited until I paid the bill and then jacked it back up sending me a bill this month for another $231.00. They are dishonest and shameful business people. They take full advantage of me all the while referring to me as a tier one customer. I am prepared to walk away from Comcast this month and join a class action lawsuit. At one time, I really did love the service. This is such a shame for me to deal with this when I am dealing with being laid off and trying to support my family
__label__1 Returned Comcast equipment and cancelled services 2 weeks prior to last day of prepaid billing and have never received my promised refund of unused services. That was 14 months ago as of today 12/3/2014.
__label__0 I had been losing my internet connection with increasing frequency over a seven week period. I finally contacted Comcast on 7/15/10. I went through their tedious menu options before reaching a person and one of the last questions asked was whether or not I would be interested in participating in a satisfaction survey at the end of my call. I responded affirmatively and immediately lost my connection and had to re-dial. The rep that I finally spoke with literally oozed indifference. I actually felt like I was imposing on her. I explained the problem and she said the soonest she could have a service person visit was 7/20/10 sometime between 9:30 and 12:30. I reluctantly agreed.After stewing for a bit I called again and spoke to another rep, who again, treated me like an annoyance. I explained that 5 days was a long time to be without service and she said that was the best Comcast could do, take it or leave it. When I described the problem I was having, she suggested I purchase a new modem and try that. I purchased a new modem and went through the byzantine registration process with Comcast only to find that I still didn't have an internet connection. I called back a final time and said that I would wait for the service rep, but expected a discount on my bill. I was given the standard $10.00 off my monthly bill.The service rep arrived shortly after noon on 7/20/10 and, hopefully, repaired the problem. So far, so good. Comcast shares a monopoly with AT&T and both companies stink. They seem to be under the impression that we are still living in 1990 when people didn't rely on their computers daily for everything from airline reservations to bill paying. Your problem is not their problem and the knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathers that they have answering phones remind you of that with every contact. I would love to see the government take over both companies, because they certainly couldn't do any worse.
__label__5 I made a call to Comcast because of a payment I made that it was wrong due to us writing one amount on the check and actually wrote on the writing part of the check the right amount then Comcast go by the amount that we wrote not the other amount. Our bank said to call Comcast and they may fix the problem, but from the moment I called to fix the problem with Comcast the cust serv was unprofessional and rude. They said nothing they can do that we would have to pay the difference and if I put a stop on the check I would get a fee of $25 and that's not counting what my bank would charge me so I left alone but then I wanted to see if I was to save some money. Yes. When I called last month because I wanted to see if I saved then they switch me to another amount, no contract but the difference with my equipment was a saving of $15 in which I'm not satisfied. I wished there were other cable company I can transfer to but on my area Comcast are the only one. This rude unprofessional Customer Service Gerry kept reminding we have been on the phone 45 min or 1 hr. "This would only would have taken 30 min to me". He sound it angry the entire conversation and just wanted to end up conversation even though we talked about other ways to save money, but in the long run I'm not saving too much and I'm not happy with this particular customer service by the name of Gerry and I didn't get a call back like it was promised 30 minutes after because I told him he was going to get rated very low. I guess they can get away with it. Right now I wish I can cancel but no other cable company on my area beside Satellite services I don't like but that would be my second option.
__label__5 It's so difficult to reach them. I usually had to 'chat' over my computer and then it's just not personal. Since I could save the transcript to prove what the agent actually said to me, that was the only positive I can offer. Entirely too expensive. Too many outages - I went for almost two weeks without cable once and they never even offered to deduct anything from my bill for not having service. 
__label__5 Over the years, I have had half a dozen different internet service providers. The most inconsistent internet signal and unhelpful technical support has been, by far, courtesy of Comcast. Rarely will I go more than an hour without having internet service slow to next-to-nothing or drop out completely. I have tried contacting customer service, but their "solutions" seem like they are just buying time to drop a charged service call on you that I would never expect to make anything better. Since everyone I know that uses Comcast has the same connectivity issues as I do, I'm going to use some deductive reasoning and conclude that the service is just bad and nothing will ever be done about it as long as they are the only high-speed internet service option. Enjoy your horrible reputation and piles of cash, Comcast.
__label__1 I have had multiple home visits from them to replace nonworking DVR boxes.  But after eight months, I am still having problems.
__label__1 Comcast technician came Thursday 19th, the signal was dropped to a lower range, and because this we were able to take seldom breaths, we still have our property been invaded with not only my tenant's signal, but also with the "XFINITY INTERNET" still surrounding very strong in my property. When I asked the Comcast technician to turn the "XFINITY" signal off from my property, his answer was "NO MATTER WHAT I DO THAT SIGNAL IS GOING TO HAVE TO STAY IN THE AIR" But I reminded him: But you are in my property and either you, your company, or whoever did the installation asked me to process it that way, with two strong signals surrounding all the way to my closets and fading away every signal it founds in it's way up to 300 ft according to the same Comcast Techs. I compare this a microwave running constantly, and their modem is HOT like an IRON!! I still want those signal away from my property.When techs confirmed to me that those signals are going to be my living-mates "Don't matter what" this was the technician's respond when I asked to turn those paid hotspots away from my property. I believe they are just acting negligent and are refusing to solve this problem. I know, they don't admit their ridiculous mistake and monopoly plan. They are trying to make it effect. Please make Comcast to treat us with respect. They think they own our houses. They believe that everybody love them. They are selfish. The HotSpot the "Xfinity" is also a rip-off. I search a sign in page for those services and for $50 to $55 a month all they give you is a single random IP so you can connect ONE, just ONE SINGLE COMPUTER. That's right. The rest of the family will have to pay another $50 for each lousy connection at 4-6 mb for second. Verizon give us 12-24 mb on WIFI and is unlimited and mobile.I thank you in advance for taking the time and doing your best to solve this issue. It is very concerning for us, as well as depressing. If I would know how crappy, possessive, invader, negligent, ** and lack of understanding their competitors needs but just do acting to disturb. My next step should be to amend my tenant's rental contract and force my tenant to delete the intruder away from my property. Comcast would be NOT be permitted to install with any of my tenants but more reasonable providers will have an opportunity. Please remove Comcast from my property. Thank you.
__label__0 As of today, 8/11/09, Comcast has transitioned their basic cable service to digital for its customers. Error notices appear on your TV that these channel are no longer available, only in digital format. This eliminated all but the basic TV channels for customers paying $21 a month for service. There is now no HGTV, CNN, The Weather Channel, etc. You only get a handful of channels.Customers must now add (Comcast) equipment and now pay a monthly charge of $55.75. After the digital transition, everything was fine (in my home anyway). Now, overnight that has changed. They have screwed their customers and once again gotten away with it. This is a crime. In this economy? Regulators have obviously allowed this to happen and people need to complain to the FCC and their local county Cable TV Franchise regulators.Comcast said they notified customers. I never received that notification however.
__label__1 I ordered Triple Play with COMCAST RESIDENTIAL (CR) on or about 3/16/2015 from ** in Colorado Springs and it has been painful since then. My internet and phone were initially with COMCAST BUSINESS (CB). CB was difficult to work with in transitioning phone and email addresses to the CR account. I really went through 15 different agents to get switched over, and after 36 hours the transition was finally made; however it appears that I am having to pay both CB and CR for 60 days until my "termination" from CB takes effect. This double pay does not make sense as both residential and business are under the primary company, Comcast.In my current CR account it shows my phone as "awaiting activation" but phones have been working in CB for several years and are still. Either they are waiting for the 60 days to be up or it seems like someone either can't flick the switch from CB to CR or won't. What can be done? Is there a time line apparent? It appears that over 500 people may have the same issue. Comcast only allows "chat" support. It is not possible to document an issue with email, and have a service representative respond. Chat services are long, enduring episodes that typically end with no resolve.
__label__1 On 5/11/13, a payment was dropped off for Jerome **. The line was outside the door, as normal. I put a $150 money order in the drop box (money order # **, a global no.). I called to make sure payment was received; they said no, that I had to wait for 5 business days. So I went back on 5/17/13 and gave the lady at the counter a copy of the m.o. She said that someone would call me. I never heard from anyone so I went back on 5/20/13. Still, there was no help. I asked for a supervisor and they said it would be 1 hour. I proceeded to wait on the supervisor for about 45 min. My sister came down to Comcast and still there were no results. We were headed to the corporate office and she drove around to the side of the building. A gentleman came out and she talked to him giving him the info and the phone number where she could be reached. He said that he would text a supervisor. On 5/21/13, someone finally contacted her around 3:00 or 4:00 and told her for me not to pay with money order any more. That money had been applied to someone else's account, and they could not take it off. She had to put a tracer on the money order and pay $15 to do that. Time has been wasted, as well as gas.
__label__0 We subscribed to the triple play plan last month. Included in this plan is the maximum speed (not sure of the technical terms) allowed for our Internet usage. We have noticed our speed is the same and actually slower. After speaking to a Comcast rep, it was determined it was not our computer and something Comcast has to fix. I think this is a scam where you pay more for more speed but get the same speeds as before. I mean, how do you actually know? And if the speed is slower, they always blame the router or your computer. I don't buy it!
__label__1 I lived in many states using many services from companies like Brighthouse and Charter and had always excellent customer service with them. But with Comcast would be my worst nightmare and support. I moved in December 2010 from Florida to Tennessee into an apartment complex. The management gave me a letter with a phone number and name on it. He would be the representative from Comcast for this area, they said. So I called him and he gave me a package price for internet, base TV and home phone of $67 per month included taxes and fees. What he didnt say was that this was a so-called promotion, good for only 12 months and what the price will be after that. So after 12 months I received a bill for $119 for the package. I was surprised and thought it would be just a mistake. So I called the hotline and a guy told me finally it was just a promotion to get customers. Shocked about that, I told him I want to cancel the package and I dont want to be a lied to Comcast customer anymore. So he connected me, what I understood, to the solution department. A woman picked up and asked me for my permission to ask me a few questions first. I have to say that they state a few times that the conversation would be recorded. So she asked me the reason for canceling. I told her about the almost 100% increase which I wasnt satisfied with. She asked me if I would consider not to cancel if she would be able to give me a better price. I said yes. So after about 15 minutes of chit-chatting with her she told me that she could bring me down to $61 plus taxes and fees and that this would be good for another 12 months again because it is a promotion again. And I have to call in 12 months again and ask if they have a promotion again. Ridiculous! Mention that this price was only for home phone and internet since I do not have a TV for over a decade now. She also said that the new price would be shown in two to three days on my online account. After about three weeks I checked my Comcast online billing account and to my surprise nothing was changed. Still the $119 showed up. So I called the hotline again. I talked to a guy again. He said he can see when I called the last time, but cannot see any changes or notes in the system or even the recordings on my last call. Im really mad about this customer handling and parody. I told him to cancel everything immediately. He connected me again to the solution department! A guy talked to me asking me the same question about my permission to ask questions about my reason why I would like to cancel and if he would give me a good price if I would change my mind. He made me then an offer of $159 per month! Remember, luring with $67, trying to keep you as a stupid customer with not changing price of $61, trying to get still the $119 and finally to punish customer for calling too much with an excessively price of $159. He told me then that his supervisor is calling me the next day to discuss this and to find a solution. Never received a phone call!  What company does this? How can they still have customers? They lure people with low prices, not telling that it is good only for 12 months, then they increase it almost 100% and when you talk to them they raise it even up another 25%. My recommendation is: get another provider because any other company is better than them. For me I got three very good friends who are attorneys and I already told one of them about that. He is taking care of this now. Lets see what they have to say about that and I also submitted this to the Better Business Bureau and filed a complaint with the FCC Consumer Complaint.
__label__0 Comcast needs to stop advertising for new customers. They can'r get it right. Our phone service, and Internet Service will not go and stays down 70% of the time. Comcast lies! They give untrue reasons for outages and you are out of luck if your service goes down on a Friday! My business depends on the Internet. Comcast, $100+ a month is a lot of money to steal from people.  Either ghet with the program or shut your doors! DO NOT GO WITH THE BUNDLE Loss of wages, worried about needing 911 when phone shuts down, can't get anything done with my Internet jobs.
__label__1 I am a snowbird and spend half my year in Florida and the other half in Massachusetts. In May I left Florida from Massachusetts and put my account on hold but paid $15 a month so that when I got back to Florida in the fall they would automatically hook my TV and everything back up to where it was originally, including original prices and selections. I called Comcast in August, 2 weeks before returning back to Florida and asked that my cable phone and Internet be turned back on Sept 9th, a day before I got home. When I got home my cable was not working. I called customer service told them that I was on the summer plan and that they should have hooked my service is back up already. They finally got my cable going yet had none of the channels that I originally had, therein they did not go back to my original plan.After 4 more phone calls and getting me hooked up with a brand new plan, which is not what I wanted, I had to call back again to specify that I wanted my original plan back. I just received my first bill since coming back to Florida and it is $265! They charge me $20 more than my original plan and also charge me $97 to switch plans which I did not do. So I just spent an hour and 45 minutes being passed around from customer service to billing with no one taking the responsibility of who needs to help me resolve this matter. I have never in my life dealt with such incompetence!! If my account is not fixed within the next day I'm canceling my service and going to make sure I tell all my friends and family to cancel also. For multi million, probably billion, dollar company they should be ashamed and embarrassed at the ineptitude of their staff!!!
__label__5 Service was disconnected for no payment. When called automated bill pay, I was advised the balance was over 800.00 dollars for one month of service because of a telephone line that I never knew about and was told by your associate it was included in plan but even the person that took care of me said something was not right but to pay $200.00 and she was kind enough to connect service until I called which I have done over 10 times with no luck. Just get the runaround from one to the other. I am sure they have ways of seeing there is no phone on this property. Just need help. They disconnected again today.
__label__1 We being with Comcast for almost 8 yrs and happy in one time. Then they sweet talked us to change to Xfinity. From day one I have problem with my box on the TV room, 90 times I can't access to my on demand channel. However I called every time when problems occurred all they said we need to send a tech service man over to change the box. After changed our box 3 times I had to refuse to have another tech in my house. I told them they need to come up with a new excuse. After calling the whole week for the same problem with on Demand plus the color is fading out. I decided to make a complaint to a supervisor of course she is not available but will call me in 2 hour. Supervisor ** called me I explained to her my complaint no sign of care. However she offered to have a tech come to my house I told her why I don't like tech in and out my house but I will take one more depending the time as my husband and I will be leaving out of down late afternoon for my husband birthday on Sunday. ** the supervisor reply she will have someone be at my house between 10am and 12noon. I had confirmed and let her know that I will be gone right after make sure they will be on time. Today after 12:30 no Comcast no phone call. I gave them a call and spoke to an agent she said my appointment is between 2pm-4pm. I am fierce after spoken and told she set me to a late appointment.
__label__5 I have had Xfinity/Comcast for years and have been pretty happy. A few weeks ago I noticed a channel had disappeared and so I called to find out why. The employee proceeded then to sell me more services since it wouldn't cost me too much more money than what I was paying. Well, the equipment arrived and when it wouldn't automatically work I contacted Xfinity again. This employee shared what this new stuff was going to cost me and so I cancelled.So, a few hours later I had no cable and called again. This person got the cable working but unbeknownst to me he reset what I had just cancelled. So, I returned the equipment and saw my bill a day ago and contacted them again since the bill was over 200% what I had been paying. So, he helped me out but told me to call customer service to finalize everything. I did. But, instead of finalizing my cancellation he proceeded to try and sell me the same thing I had already cancelled twice. WTH is going on here?
__label__5 No written contract. When I call I am shuffled around. When my alarm needed servicing, I was charged $50 without warning. Always seem to have TV and internet - except for a few times when the router went out or some such thing. When I signed up for a 3 year contract I got no written contract, nothing in writing and in my 3rd year my price skyrocketed (supposed to be a $10 increase per year). I think Comcast's motto is to get the most money you can out of the most customers. Highly unethical - and don't bother calling the AG's office or complaining to the FTC. They don't care and only send you back to Comcast to re-hash your problem. We pay waaay toooo much for these services. And I am a nex cable subscriber - having just got it Nov. 2013. My internet has gone out a few times and I need to call in - or go online to reboot it. Pain. TC/Cable and telephone seem most reliable. Again they gave me no manuals or paperwork/contract. I had voice mail for almost a year before realizing I had it as no messages were being recorded on the old answering machine. Comcast seems not to want to provide you with your contract in writing and when you call them - they have no record of it either!
__label__1 False advertisement. Plain and simple. I signed up for 79.99/ month starter double play and got a package for 99.00/ month. I called 30 minutes after installation when I realized there were problems. They told me sorry, nothing they could do since I was no longer a new customer. Seriously?? Also, their 39.95 installation is actually 79.95. They won't tell you the 39.95 is just for the tech to pull into your driveway... The other is a 20.00 fee for a video line and a 20.00 fee for an internet line. I've never had Comcast. I've been a DirecTV customer for 10 years, but I needed internet and sadly Comcast internet is so high you may as well bundle with your cable. I'm very disappointed so far, and its only been 6 days. I would like to one day see a choice for cable... These companies ate a monopoly. Unless of course you want satellite... And don't even get me started on satellite internet!
__label__0 Excessive billing.   Was mis-led concerning charges.  Was told there would be no fees to emplement theirproduct!!!.  Have had nothing but extra fee's for more than three months. In what should have been a about a 180to maybe a 190.  they have come up with a 229.71.   All for one time charges.  They are always charging a one time fee for everything thet do!!!!In an attempt to conserve on spending, and through their adds,, I have spent more than double compared to what I was doing!!!...  For example;  I changed over to their phone service. Or they call it digital voice.  It was 24.95 quoted to me.  I asked about special charges,, theit response as always ,, theres no charge!!.   Out of a quote of 24.95, per month,  how do they come up with 64.31.Plus one time charges of 64.94.  I don't get it.   All I know I spending a far more than I anticipated, while trying to purchase a cheaper service.
__label__1 Ordered Comcast TV & Internet was to be $79 plus $20 more for HD. May have a $40 installation fee but not for sure. I already had Internet so installation was simple. So I was expecting a $99 + Tax bill. Got my 1st Bill and it was $378 for all kinds of charges. After many calls to customer service about false Advertising and deceptive promises by sales rep and being charged for things I did not get. They lowered it by $90 but still charged my credit card $378. This company practices deception and downright lies to its customers. Told them to listen to recording of sales call and they won't do it. Needs to have new law passed to control their practices.
__label__1 After listening to a bunch of "foreign babble", nothing was resolved. Comcast has been increasing my monthly bill at 'will', with no real explanations for these billings. They are so sneaky, you have to watch every charge ..nothing stays the same and you never get a straight answer. I have been a cable customer since the late 70's so I guess COMCAST THINKS I WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE THEIR MESS. They are mistaken...I have had it. I am switching, I am going to AT&T. Perhaps they will appreciate me as a customer.
__label__1 Comcast is an absolute JOKE!!! What a sorry excuse for an organization. No wonder they rate 1 Star. I am sure they would rate 0 if the system allowed. I am a 49 year professional businessman who has NEVER lodged a formal complaint in his life (in sum, I am not difficult to please). It took the complete Clowns at Comcast to break the ice. Kudos to them. I informed Comcast that I would be relocating to Florida and needed to settle up. I took my equipment to them and asked to square up with my final bill. The rep informed me he could not calculate final bill and Comcast would be in touch w/in 2 weeks. They never called. I made incumbent upon myself to contact them (twice). Again, I was told they did not have my bill ready and they would contact me via my cell phone. They never called. Instead these complete idiots, Unbeknownst to me, turned me over to a collection agency for a bill that I tried to pay 3 times. I obviously paid it on the spot including the $9 collection fee. This, after months of having my bill arbitrarily hiked without reasonable explanation. Avoid Comcast!! There are much better options.
__label__1 Was charged for a modem that I returned when I bought my own. My wife pays the bills and didn't notice. When I found out, I went to the Comcast office, showed them my return receipt, and they agreed to take the current charge off my account. "What about the 9 months you charged me for?" "We can't do that" was the answer. Same answer when I complained to the Comcast rep by phone. Overpaid $63 in total.
__label__1 My complaint is so sad, it's funny. I found some equipment I think belongs to Comcast. It was in the middle of the street as if it had fallen off of a truck. Trying to be nice, I called the number for the local office to see if they would claim it. The recorded message gave me three specific choices, none of which applied to this situation, so I picked "start a new account." I was routed to a call center six states away. When I explained the problem they hung up on me. I tried again, and this time, they routed me to customer service (still not in state). I asked them for the phone number of the local Comcast office, and they said they couldn't find it and they couldn't call them. In other words, A COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZES IN COMMUNICATIONS IS UNABLE TO CALL ONE OF THEIR OWN OFFICES. So yeah, the equipment is now in the dumpster.
__label__0 I'm at my mother's house recovering from surgery. We lost cable, phone, and Internet last night at 10pm. They fixed the phone and cable. I got the Internet to work after 4 hours on the phone around 7am. It died before 6pm. I dealt with numerous rude sickos for 4 hours only to have them blame the problem on Vista, even though I never had problems until they started jacking with my settings.They refuse to put my mother's correct SS# on her account and they abuse her every time she has to call over that. They kept confusing us with another account, and telling us that it worked or that we didn't have wi-fi, like we're a couple of brain-damaged 5 year-olds. It worked for two hours, then died again. After being uncommonly evil, they told us that they couldn't get a tech guy out here for 86 hours. This is terrible.If it were their intention to be the worst, most evil, incompetent, sadistic company on this planet I can't think of a single thing they would be doing differently. Since they confused my mother's account with mine in another town (I'm here recovering from surgery) and they jacked with all my settings for 7 hours I know that when I get back home nothing will work there, either. So 8 hours on the phone with these psychopaths and everything is worse than when I first called. This is the 4th of the last 7 days that the Internet has gone out, and it will be another 4 before they get out here
__label__0 Well, as of today I have had two horrible experiences with Comcast. I've been with Comcast since 07/2008. Two months ago I had a chatting session with one of Comcast's representatives over upgrading my service. She gave me all this hoopla on how because I pay my bills before due date, I would get all these great deals and free promotions. Later the same day, I thought it must be too good to be true. I went online to confirm all these wonderful deals. Of course, the man had no idea. Thank God I copied and pasted the entire conversation! Well, I was P.O. of course. I informed the representative about what took place and pasted him the conversation, as well as sent the entire conversation to the FCC with a complaint. But don't get me wrong, he went above and beyond to keep me as a customer.Then, I just moved to my first home and transferred my service, and kept my box from my last place. I am unable to access On Demand (Error 4). I called this time and a gentleman who seemed tired said he will reset it, and to wait 30 minutes. I wait and guess what happened next? On the second call, I got some woman with a condescending attitude. I tried to have her just reset my box and fix the On Demand. Well, we went from the problem with my box to my billing issues (note that I had received promotional deals 2 months prior), stating that I should be paying $15 for my box, but I am only paying a fraction. I informed the woman (customer service) that I have a promotional deal. She stated that because I have a DVR-HD box (I've had this box since service started), I am being charged for just the HD. Why am I going over with the type of box that was given to me at the time I started service? She would not let up, stating I got off for months, like I was robbing them from the get-go.  I asked for a supervisor. Well, she came back on saying, "I spoke to my supervisor and we will cut the price," which is more than what I am paying now. My bill is already more than what it should be. I finally got a supervisor who sounded just like the representative. She was not trying to help, either. I just said that I did not call to go over my bill (mind you I pay my bill the first of the month, every month), I called to get my box reset so I can enjoy the On Demand that I am paying for! I got it done, but for some odd reason she was so quick to set up an appointment for a service man to come and visit. Why? Can you or can you not reset my box?All in all, I am ready to settle for a dish. I felt so belittled and upset by the hour that was wasted just to fix the box. Thanks Comcast! FYI, my second letter to the FCC and State Attorney General's office will be sent. There needs to be some type of policy or procedure that your customer service center should take on manners and respect towards customers who will be loyal to your company in the future.
__label__1 We have had a total nightmare with Comcast. I will not have enough room for the entire story on this forum. We tried to transfer our services from the Bay Area to Sacramento. It was supposed to be "easy". They sent out techs to the new location on the wrong days. We weren't even home. They missed the days that they scheduled with us, the right days. When someone finally came out, they had half of the equipment. Lied about having a "sup" drop off the rest of the equipment the next day. That never happened. To this day we still don't have the equipment. We were even dumb enough to add security through them. They flaked on that first appointment which I drove 3 hours to make. They have tried to bill my wife for things we never ordered. Every time we call and get someone on the phone, we get a different story. There is much more to this story and Comcast executives need to hear the full struggle and nightmare we have had. What they are doing should be against the law and I should be compensated for all of my wasted time and money.
__label__1 I first contracted with Comcast for Internet 2 1/2 years ago. For the first six months (my initial contract), everything was great, exceptional internet speeds for a great price. As soon as my initial rate expired, not only did the prices become exorbitant but the MBPS started fluctuating and had very little reliability going forward. I have called or chatted with Comcast 15 times in the last 2 1/2 years to resolve the issue. It's always the same steps, restart your modem, restart your router, we'll send a technician, the technician arrives and finds nothing wrong, calls his support center, BOOM, magically speeds are restored. Mind you, this is how they get you to keep paying their service center fee so it won't cost you $70 every time they come out.Every interaction with Comcast Support has left me angry and I am far from an angry man. I have worked retail and service industry jobs and strive to treat these employees with respect as it's not their fault their company has such poor practices. Today however was the last straw. After receiving speeds of 1 - 10 mbps down all day, I finally made the dreaded decision to chat with them. After being disconnected from the chat, via their troubleshooting steps, reconnecting and then being disconnected to finally reconnect and their technician no longer being in the chat room, I've had enough. Conveniently enough, there's no survey link when this happens for me to report my extreme dissatisfaction. These seem to only appear when an interaction has gone well. I suspect it's at the behest of the support individual on whether they'll send the survey or not.Not only have I had myriad connectivity issues for an inordinate amount of time but my bill has magically risen. I attempted to get this resolved on four separate occasions and finally gave up after being stonewalled. There literally is NO POINT to bring any complaint whether it be technical or billing related. They will do NOTHING. The ONLY reason I am still a Comcast customer is that I have no other choice. This is the WORST company I have ever worked with, by far. As soon as I move, I will be choosing a new ISP and washing my hands of Comcast forever.
__label__0 I started my service on 7-9-08 with Comcast. I cancelled the service on 7-19-08 and was sent a bill for $367.27. Since then, I have received numerous bills with various different amounts owned and when I called each time to find out what I owed, no one could ever tell me exactly what I owed or why I even owed. I get a different amount and different story each time I call. Since then, Comcast has sent me to a collection agency, which has negatively impacted my credit score. According to my calculations, I have overpaid Comcast. I don't know when or how to even begin to get my money back, not to mention the time and headaches. In addition to my billing problem, following are letters and emails that I wrote/sent to several executives and NEVER received a response: I wanted to tell you how disappointed I am with Comcast service (or lack thereof) and will be cancelling my service immediately upon finding a new provider. Let's begin with my installation where your sub fell through my ceiling. A week later with a hole still in my ceiling, after my A/C ran non-stop to cool my bedroom and attic, after sleeping in a bed with my 13-year old son and being on hold for over an hour, Comcast sent someone out to repair my ceiling. The ceiling repair was cheaply done and not done correctly. I have taken pictures for documentation. As if this has not been enough, the balance from the previous person that had the phone number Comcast assigned to me has been transferred to my account. It is over $500 and I've only had your service for a few weeks! I talked to a supervisor today that informed me she could not help me and that I would need to contact customer service to get this resolved. She said she was unable to transfer me, but gave me the phone number to call. The phone number I was given was 713-462-9700, which is a fax! I have the phone conversation recorded (I've learned I have to do this when speaking to anyone at Comcast) to verify my conversation. I have names and dates of every person I have spoken to during this nightmare. I have a 13-year old son that was recently diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease (a form of cancer) and one of his wishes was for me (his mother - a single parent) to get internet. I have enough to deal with right now and don't need this added frustration nor do I have the time.Through numerous conversations, I have found out that most people I talked to have had a bad experience with Comcast. Comcast has a horrible reputation and that's very unfortunate. I will continue to tell others about this experience in an effort to save them time and frustration. I suggest you seriously make a change in personnel and training if you want to keep customers. With other providers like AT&T offering similar if not better service, this is a change you better make quickly! I almost have no sanity left and I need help! If there is anyone that can help me, I would greatly appreciate it.
__label__1 I have called 3 months in a row. After my 1st year was up, Comcast started raising my bill every month until it is almost double what it was a year and a half ago. They wouldn't lower the speed cost to match the speed of internet that we actually got and lied twice saying we were getting the faster speed. They refuse to do anything but try and sell me a more expensive and a contract. I don't want either and they don't listen. I have never used another company but they have single-handedly priced me out of their services. I have no choice but to go to a competitor and the person on the phone wished me well. How did this company become so big? Customers who have been with them 15 years don't matter. This is a crappy company.
__label__1 I was a Comcast customer years ago, and was very dissatisfied so I switched to Dish. A salesman sold me on giving them another try since I was not satisfied with my internet service. He told me that install would be easy and the install tech would do everything. I let the sales rep know that I had two phone lines in my home and they both had to be connected. When the installer came, he said he knew nothing about a second line, and he didn't know what to do since both lines had to connect it on the modem. I let him know that the sales rep told me that the installer would run a new line if he had to. He then said they don't do that, and He would not do that.After thinking about it for a few minutes, his solution was to drill a hole through both sides of an interior wall and run a feeder line from the second phone line to the modem. UNACCEPTABLE! I'm fairly handy, so I got to work and ran a new line myself and added a new phone jack in the room near the modem. While I was doing this he was getting more and more agitated because of the time it was taking. Bottom line it... I ended up spending my time and labor to get the install done. The sales rep completely misrepresented what would happen on the install. The sales rep was very nice when he hooked me in. He said to just call him if I had any issues. "I'm always available", he said. Three phone calls today, and no answer.It's just been a few hours, and all the memories of why I left them in the first place have come back. I'm ready to quit again. To top it off, 5 minutes after he left, the internet service stopped working. The only bright note of the day was that I called the toll free number and someone got it going remotely. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST/XFINITY.
__label__1 I called Comcast to inquire about getting service with them on Sept 4, 2012. They have told me some things before, so I had a paper and pen ready and wrote down everything he said that I would be getting, after asking him several times to make sure. I was told I could get a pack for $89 a month and that I could get an HD-DVR free for the first 6 months. After that it would be $7/month, but I could cancel the HD part if I wanted to. He told me I would receive Showtime free for the first 6 months and we would always have Stars and Encore, the additional box I wanted in my bedroom would be $9.99 a month and that all these with taxes would bring my total to $104.75/month. He said after a year, the bill goes up to $20 and there would be nothing more after that. He told me my first bill would have a $34 fee for installation, making it around $140 and that after 90 days of service I would receive a $100 VISA card. When the technician showed up to install my services, he explained that the box I was getting in my room was a DVR and that if I wanted just a free box he could put in a regular cable box. This was not explained to me in the call, but it wasn't a huge deal, so that should have brought my bill down to $94/month. I was pretty stoked. A few days later, my hubby discovered he did not get a channel with a show he loved to watch. I called up and inquired about it and ended up adding additional channels for $9.99/month, so it really just cancelled out the money I was saving for the box in my room and my bill still should have been the $104.75. When I received my first bill due on October 3rd, it was $175. I called and spoke to someone who told me she would have a person review it and that I could check it online in a few days to see if it had gone down. I went online a few days later and it had gone down about $10. A few days later, I went back online to see if maybe they had figured it all out when my bill said it was 2 days past due (this was still September). My balance was $312. I havent had service with them for a month and I had a balance of $312. When I got the printout of the bill, the $312 was for the $175 I owed plus an additional $136. Not only was my first bill completely wrong, but instead of the $104.75 I was promised on the phone, I was being charged $136. I called again and spoke to another agent who just went around in circles explaining my charges away but never explained why I was not getting the deal I was promised. I called back a few days later and asked another agent about my bill. She again tried to explain my charges without listening to me say that I was not getting anything I was promised. Upon more conversation, she told me that it would be cheaper if I returned my HD-DVR to my local Comcast center, and that I was being charged a $7/ month as rent for the modem. I was never told that in the initial call to set up service, and I also told the technician that I had my own modem. I was also never informed about the $16 DVR charge, but that I would have a free HD-DVR for 6 months and it would be $7 a month after that. I know this because I wrote down everything I was told in the call for my own notes, so I knew what I was getting in to. It was not even mentioned on the customer agreement they sent to me. I was getting very frustrated with the lack of communication with the company, so I went to my local Comcast center and spoke to someone there. She confirmed the $16 DVR fee and $7 modem rent fee. I brought in my own modem, but she said that if I wanted to continue having a home phone, I could not use my own to skip the $7 modem fee. I told her I didn't need a home phone. But she said if I took it off, the package would be worse than the triple play I had. She basically told me she didn't really care what the first guy initially told me, but the prices were the prices and there was nothing she could do. After a little more talking, she finally gave me a free DVR for 6 months since thats what I was told. But after that, it was supposed to go up to $16, which brought my bill down to about $120. This is better, but still not what I was promised. That was last week when I went in locally, so I just went online to check my bill and it was $128. I am sick to my stomach over all the lies. Besides, how does my bill go from $136, take off $16, and still be $128? I know for a fact they record all of their calls and have asked them several times to listen to it and honor what was I was told in the beginning, but no one will even address it when I bring it up. All I ever get from the agents is the runaround when I call. No one can explain why I was told the opposite of what I was getting. Please help, I am more than frustrated!
__label__0 Comcast prices have gotten so ridiculous that I went down there, to lower my package. I have basic now with something called digital economy. That, plus internet, is still just under $100 a month. Anyway, I have a HD DVR in my living room, and returned the DVR from my bedroom. Well, with the new Xfinity, my bedroom TV  now only gets like 15 channels, and most of them are local access. I feel if I am paying for a particular channel. I should get that channel on all TVs in the house.  Well, in order to get the channels I subscribe to in the bedroom, I would have to upgrade to the next highest package, which is an additional $30 per month. Also, channels like TNT, TBS, and others used to be part of the basic package, or expanded basic, which they no longer offer.  So I have lost these channels altogether. The satellite companies offer these in their basic package.  I could go on, and on, but what is the point.  I am a single income family that cannot afford a social life, so TV and internet is all I have, and they have made it unaffordable to the average person.
__label__0 Beware of Comcast, too big for good policies and service.Installation was horrible and took 2 months, 6 visits, overcharged for them to get service going. After 3 years, when disconnecting on 8/9/2010, they still charge for a full month on the final bill and then prefer to send a check for the service you did not use, which takes up to 5+ weeks! Why overcharge for something you did not receive in the first place?! Horrible process.
__label__1 In March 2011, I joined a leads group from the Fort Wayne Chamber of Commerce. My sister and I were getting ready to open up a gift store in downtown Fort Wayne. A representative from Comcast was a member of that leads group. She talked to us about a great deal Comcast was offering at that time - $129 for 2 phone lines and internet service. Knowing we were going to need these services for our gift store, I told her I was interested and she gladly set everything up for me. She never once mentioned anything about a $300 installation fee or having to sign a three-year contract. She had me sign for the service.After the services were installed, I received a bill for over $400 and was shocked. I did pay the bill even though I was upset she never mentioned the installation fee. Today, June 27, 2012, I called to cancel the service since my sister and I are closing our gift store. That's when I was told I signed a three-year contract and I would have to pay a $2,000 fee to get out of the contract! I was beyond shocked! First of all, she never even mentioned that I was signing a three-year contract. I never would have signed a three-year contract because my lease was only for two-years!This Comcast representative never mentioned anything in regards to not being able to cancel this service at will. It's very deceptive and after reading the thousands of complaints, I'm not sure where to turn. A supervisor was supposed to call or email me but nothing. I want to nip this in the bud now before this turns into something that drags on for months. I don't trust them as far as I can throw them!
__label__1 I tried to get hold of Comcast installation department and went through CSR and supervisor but to no avail. They do not have any info in regards the installation crew nor do they have a telephone number and/or an email. I had a Comcast technician climb my 6-1/2 ft. fence (because the gate was locked and I was home at the time and no one tried to let me know that they needed to get into the back yard). Also, the access to the poles that were needed was on another property and not mine. I do not have Comcast so I was pretty upset as there is a reason for the locked gate; we have a pool and also two dogs (good thing they were not out at the time). He was there with another technician who eventually knocked on the door (I think) as I didn't hear him.The dogs let me know and when I confronted him about his partner already being in the yard and how he got into the yard, he said he didn't know. Needless to say, they took down my birdhouses and did not put them back up. I had a doctors appointment. My husband who came home to take me opened the gate for them and advised them that they could be charged with trespassing, unlocked the gate and told them not to do it again. But this was the 2nd time that I had a confrontation with Comcast. A month ago, another technician proceeded to let himself in our yard and when confronted, he told me that if I cut my bushes, there would be no need for him to come into my yard. Needless to say, the bushes belonged to the neighbor whose cable he was working on. My daughter had a problem also. Her neighbor had cable installed and they went right through the middle of her yard instead of the right of way and needless to say, the neighbor had a problem when they needed to run a tiller on their yard for tree stumps. Rest assured Comcast did use the legal right of way when they had to replace the chopped up cable. You would think that a company as large as this company would have something on their website pointing to complaints.
__label__0 For the past several weeks, one PBS program, The New Hour, suffers many technical interruptions. I've contacted the local PBS station, and they say the problem is with Comcast, Comcast is aware of it, and has not told them that it would fix it.  I've tried to complain to Comcast, and have not been able to figure  out how to do so! This is unconsciounable--that Comcast would make it impossible to complain to them, and that they would ignore a problem that disrupts a popular program.  The damages are to the local PBS station, and to PBS nationally -- when long-time viewers of The News Hour, like me, are so irritated by the frequent technical twitching (at least every 5 minutes or so) that we switch to network news.
__label__1 On Sunday, Dec. 21, 2014, my internet suddenly went out. I was told that the problem was in the wiring and they would have to send a technician. What had happened was that my next door neighbor moved and instead of disconnecting her line, they disconnected mine. Not only was I without internet for two days (which I use for my work), they billed me for the call! The technician put some codes on the work order that said they made some changes to the wiring in my house. All they did was screw the cable back onto the box. I was standing there when he did it.When I called customer service they offered to waive half the fee, which tells me that they knew they had screwed up. When I told them that in essence they were billing me for their error, they said they could only go by what was on the paperwork (a copy of which the tech did not leave me). I went up two levels at customer service to a senior supervisor, who told me that if it was up to him he "would bill me for the whole thing," because I'd taken up so much of his colleague's time. This is the second incident in less than a year that I have lost income due to Comcast. Two months ago my modem started failing and I had to take it to the branch for a replacement or pay for a service call for THAT. I've only had this service since April 11th -- less than a year!
__label__0 Ever since Comcast took over Insightbb here in northern Illinois, Internet and cable service has crap. I have a year's worth of random various test results other than typical speed tests demonstrating the issues I have been complaining to Comcast officials about their services. I am on a 16/2 plan and generally average 1/3 to 1/2 of "rated tier". Local HD channels are way over compressed and experience "robot underwater" sound. After initial contact with Frank ** and his right hand techie I have a post from Him and an email from tech William ** stating that we (Rockford) customers were being routed through a CMT server that we should not have been. That was about 7/31/2009 after going for 6 months posting PingPlotter results on my Dslreports.com review for Comcast. Well they finally fixed that issue; however, the DPI and protocol agnostic and Comcast's deceiving way of doing things Have still left service to be desired for the premium I have been faithfully paying. I can provide data and correspondence letter from latest Comcast official contact with my immediate response providing test results on Comcast's own server reputing what Joe ** Claimed. Filed report with Illinois State's attorney with sample test results. Contacted 2 elected State Officials about the same. Fixing to go to small claims.
__label__1 Had the worse experience that I had with any company or anyone!!! Can't talk to anyone on the phone and when you do it does no good because they DO NOT do anything they say they will. Almost doubled my rate that they (supposedly) signed me up for. You have to take the equipment back to THEM as they say they will not pick it up. They can pick it up out of my dumpster if they want it - I will treat them like they treated me.I'm canceling this lousy, lying, two-faced, sorry excuse for a business and going to Triton. Comcast also lies to you about how many megabytes you need to have to order so as to attempt to drive folks toward the higher priced Mbps and Triton offers 8 Mbps (more than most any company needs) that they guarantee will do me better than Comcast's 105 Mbps @ over a 100 bucks where Triton charges 29.95 per month with a 50.00 one time installation and this is a month to month agreement rather than having to sign up to Comcast for much longer periods of time. SO I SAY COME AND GET YOUR CRAP EQUIPMENT BECAUSE YOU ARE HISTORY TO ME AND I HOPE ANYONE WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE GETTING INVOLVED WITH THIS RIPOFF COMPANY!!!!!
__label__1 I've been with Comcast since 1992 - obviously, I'm a stellar, loyal customer. Always pay the bill on time and have never had my service disconnected. In spite of these facts, I'd say for the past three years at least, practically every month, I've had to call and argue with them about overcharges on the monthly bills (I've not been under contract for many years). After extensive phone conversations with Cust. Serv. reps, and long hold times, the monthly phone calls about the incorrect bills inevitably end up with their Customer Resolutions Dept. - the big dead end, last stop specialists for those of us who are so frustrated and disgusted that we're threatening to disconnect.At that point, totally depending on who you get on the phone (nice versus rude and arrogant), you can possibly be granted a promised deal for the next 12 months - which, for the umpteenth time, is what happened to me on 8/4/16. I was told all incorrect past due amounts were removed from my account, I owed them zero; I was told to pay $169 that day, and the bill will be $169 per month for the next 12 months - got her name and ID # (forget calling back and asking for the rep. you spoke to last time - you're never allowed to talk to them again). By the way, same story over the years - month after month of fraudulently hiked up bills, phone calls, promises, then promises broken, followed by more hiked up incorrect bills. So I paid as requested for August and Sept., $169 for each month. Lo and behold, my most recent bill which arrived a few days ago showed a balance of $465.I called and went through the same old phone routine and got a really nasty rep. in Cust. Solutions who wouldn't budge, insisting I owe them $269. Furious and livid, I told him he's a stupid and arrogant SOB to take a chance on losing a great customer who's paid religiously since 1992. He hung up on me for cursing at him. I vowed that's the last time I call Comcast. I'm 67 years old and if I'm lucky I might have another 20 years. I want to stay in good health and that means reducing aggravation factors in my life, including one named COMCAST.So as of this coming Monday, I'm with Verizon Fios - I'll go out and celebrate after I drop off Comcast's crappy equipment boxes, etc., which I'm obligated to physically return prior to termination of service - for which I've obscenely had to pay them rent for on top of their greedy, disgusting overcharges for horrible services rendered, and the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE on the planet Earth. One last thing - about a month ago, they drilled into the masonry of my house without permission, causing cracks in the stone. The pimply 20-something kid outside said he works for Comcast and I shouldn't worry - they're installing new boxes on all the houses in my block. When I informed he he didn't have my permission to drill into my property, he said "we knocked but you didn't answer".I'm now considering a Small Claims Court case for damages - will ask the masonry guy for an estimate. Goodbye and good riddance Comcast! I HOPE YOU GO BANKRUPT THEN ROT IN HELL! ROBBERS AND UNSCRUPULOUS THIEVES -- I HATE YOU -- CORPORATE PIGS!!
__label__1 I took out TV and internet service with Comcast in January 2013 at my Florida location. I explained it would be temporary and paid the full rate (no discounts for contract duration) for the service. On 3/27/13, I returned their equipment to their Leesburg, FL service office, expecting to get a refund for unused time and returning the equipment. To date, I have received a check for $21.07 from a total of $66.07. When I contacted them about the remaining $45.00, I discovered they were keeping that because I supposedly failed to return their equipment.When I returned the equipment to the Leesburg office on 3/27/13, I asked the lady on duty if I could get a receipt showing that I returned the equipment. She informed me that all of the equipment had serial numbers and they would identify when it was returned by the numbers. A couple of weeks after I returned to Ohio, I received a call from a Comcast rep asking when I would return the equipment. I explained that I had and what I was told in the Leesburg office. She assured me she would take care of the issue. Since then it has gone downhill. I used chat (more than once) to discuss the problem. Finally, I had a chat on 5/10/13 with one Melani, who assured me I would receive a check in 3 to 4 weeks. To date, I have not received the $45.00 they owe me. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I did what I was asked and I feel as though I am being treated as a liar or just flat being ignored. I returned their equipment on 3/27/2013. It is now 6/27/13. I think there has been more than sufficient time to return my refund. If I owed them money, would they wait three months to get it?I want someone to contact them about this issue and, if possible, their ratings to be negatively affected because of it. If you are not the agency to do so, please advise with whom I should file this complaint that will take some kind of action with Comcast.

__label__1 I pay over $300 a month for the bundle service - cable TV, telephone and internet. I have three televisions on HD cable and pay extra for each of the HD boxes. The biggest problem we have is with the internet service. The service will all of a sudden disconnect from the Internet. When you troubleshoot the problem, it will say check your modem/router connections, which I have done. We have several computers in the house and the disconnect does not happen all at once - it is random on each computer. It would seem to me if there was a router/modem connection problem that they would all go down at the same time. You can be responding to an email and go to send your response - no connection. I have tried to contact customer service and have not been connected. I tried to email them two days ago and my entire email system went down and I did not receive emails yesterday. I have not called because I know they will say it is my equipment and we will have to buy new/pay for a service visit. We have been customers of Comcast since they first entered the market here over 25 years ago. We are starting to look at other options. I am tired of being held hostage. If it were just me, I would disconnect everything but I have a sports fanatic and grandchildren who watch on-demand and cartoon network.
__label__1 In June, I signed up for the $29.99/month for the Internet Plus plan. When I received my first bill, I noticed being charged $39.99 for the service. I have contacted Comcast countless times since then, as I am still being overcharged. Despite calls, chat sessions, promises to receive callbacks, nothing has been resolved. I have even provided a screenshot of the Internet Plus promotion on Comcast.com for $29.99/month taken the day I signed up, but they refuse to honor it as it isn't a current promotion, even though it was when I signed up! The only attempts at correcting this issue were giving me faster internet and additional channels for a month each. Both of these resulted in even more additional charges to my account. Also, as part of my promotion, I was supposed to receive a $50 Visa prepaid card after 90 days of service. Six months have gone by, and I still have not received it. Whenever I inquire about this with Comcast, I am given the same response: "Please allow up to sixteen weeks from your installation for your Visa prepaid card to mail. The additional four weeks after the 90-day period is to account for processing." The two images are screenshots of the promotion for $29.99/month and my bill, reflecting the incorrect charge. To clarify my bill, it should state $69.95 - $39.96 $29.99/month promotion) + $8.00 = $37.99.
__label__1 I just recently moved to the place I am now and request Comcast service due to the reason this is the cheaper cable company around here. It was the worst decision ever. The cable is literally a basic local channel antenna with no good channels at all. All the cable channels are blocked, the only channels you can see are the same ones you can see with an antenna, and the WiFi is the worst - the signal doesn't even arrive to my bedroom, you need to literally be next to the modem to get a good signal... sometimes. I'm just going to cancel this crap and look for another company.
__label__1 They try to upsell at all costs. They talk in circles; never get a straight answer. Even their retention dept... After I was customer like 15 plus yrs only wanted to give me the fake 2 yrs "deal" that after the 2 yrs went to normal prices that I cannot afford. They lie. Told me I had a deal and it changed. "No. You never had a 15 yr old deal" lol. They actually made me cry. They would not let me cancel!! Look online. It is true. People have to say they died! Or just move and not give new address. They a passive aggressive. And aggressive period. Mean. It is a cult! My on demands would freeze late at night. That is when you need it most. When there are no good shows on! They always blamed me/My home/My box. I went in to get new boxes and all of the cords they gave me to plug into the wall were the wrong ones!! All. Amazing. They were not apologetic. And refused to let me talk to the manager. Was my highest bill. Ludicrous. Netflix is 10 times or more less. It is a monopoly basically. They scam you. They can do what they want. And they don't feel bad. They made me literally sick. Made me cry. Didn't even attempt to keep me; a 15 plus year customer. Refused to let me talk to a manager many times. Comcast truly felt like a cult. And went out of their way to give me bad service. Acting like... I personally bothered them.
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer for years and moved resident; I called to have account moved... so far so good. They made the appointment for a week later... all good. When the tech came, he did nothing and rescheduled for a week a day. I called unsatisfied. I have called several times each day since the appointment to ask for them to better assist. I feel that I should not be punished for bad service and lack of preparation. Bad service is bad service. They do not care about their customers.
__label__0 I have been a Comcast customer for probably 18 years. 13 through my condo which I had no dealings with, but 5 since I purchased my home. For the most part things were fine, despite the fact periodically, they raised the prices or required new equipment without letting me know. On several occasions, I considered switching but figured the energy in switching wasn't worth the increases.On 8/24/10, I contacted Comcast to see about having my bill reduced and possibly add DVR service. My friend contacted them and had her bill reduced by about 20% but of course they never do that without you asking for it. Increases are automatic, decreases you have to 'beg' for. In any event I thought it was worth a try, but also thought it was time to get on the DVR wagon. I entered into a Chat session with an associate and we discussed the options. Of course, they were very polite. Little did I know, I was entering a state of 'false sense of security.' I figured I had our transaction in writing, so if anything went wrong I had 'proof.' Additionally, it allowed me to do other things. Now, despite the fact this took an hour and a half (which is too long in my opinion for a consumer or for a company), I went away with a secure feeling that all was set. I triple verified the prices and asked all questions under the sun. Now the nightmare begins. For the last two and a half months I have nothing but headaches. Firstly, they never showed up for the appointment that I took 1/2 a day off work for. When I contacted them, they didn't have it in the system, despite the fact they had the upgrade but no appointment? We rescheduled, got a credit for the appointment. Then they didn't show up for the 2nd appointment. When I called to find out what was going on, the hold message stated, you have an appointment for the 11th (it was the 4th and it was supposed to be at 11 am) The woman who came on said, "Yes, I see notes for the 4th, but maybe since it has passed it kicked it to the next week."Long story short on that, when I got the dispatch manager, she told me that person lied. I wasn't in the system! What the, she was rude, and when I called her out on that and what I have had to deal with she changed her tone.A tech showed up at my door 30 minutes later. Finally! Then the next phase of problems started, my bill was all wrong, the prices quoted where not honored and the install credit wasn't there. When I emailed to inquire, they told me they said, "We don't see those prices, so sorry."After a solid week of e-mailing, I got a supervisor call. He was a bit snippy with me at first and when I didn't back down, he finally listened. He too told me that he doesn't know what I am talking about those prices aren't in the system and never were. I said, as I said at least 10 times, I have it in writing. He said 'oh, well' send it to me but it doesn't mean we can honor it. I said, "Really?" When I inquired about it they said, it was because I kept one of the once free digital boxes when I added the DVR. I explained I didn't know that, and I put it in a spare room just because.They should have told me. Why would I pay 9.99 for DVR and 7.50 for a spare box? They said, I needed to initiate a chat and have it removed. Oh yeah and the 24.99 for 12 months never existed, so they won't honor it. So again, I started a chat session and there they told me that A. they can't honor it. When I told them I have it in writing, get me a supervisor, they said basically, "Oh well, nothing we can do and no we can't transfer you to a supervisor." On the 7.50 charge, they changed their story. It is now a fee to get the DVR service. Well, I am already paying for the DVR service and I was told there wasn't an equipment fee. Yeah, oh well, if you take that off you won't get service, even though I am paying 80 dollars for service, if I don't pay the 7.50, I won't get any. **? So, I decided to write the same supervisor from before and explain the situation again, with all in writing. He has chosen to not respond to me this time. No phone calls no e-mails. I so want to send this to the newspapers. It is wrong. They quote, get me to agree then change everything and honor only 80% but after I have to fight for 2 and 1/2 months. It is bait and switch and dishonorable. 
__label__1 Service was out for more than 12 hours. Was suppose to receive a text when service was back up. Never got! Have been charged $11 a month for blast internet that I never signed up for. I hate calling Comcast. You get passed around and around before you get help. The automated system says "Did you know", well if my freaking internet is down how can I? I may not renew after my contract is up. A stupid windstorm or snow storm knocks out cable. How sad!! @@
__label__5 I am a Comcast business class subscriber. I used the business line for a home office in Chicago. Comcast constantly goes down. I would say that at least twice a month for the past 10 months, there is always a problem affecting the area. Since the line is leased, cancellation comes with a hearty price. When contacting Comcast it is the same story. The best one was that their DNS was down. I found this an odd reason, considering that I run a local DNS which doesn't even use the Comcast DNS. I suppose, point and click problem solver 2.0 doesn't take this into account because if their DNS doesn't work, nothing does?
__label__0 I have sent repeated emails over the past month to Comcast regarding my cable service. The problem is that the cable service is non-functioning, but yet I am still being billed. I told them that it appears that the problem exists with their feeder lines outside of my home, but no one checked. One day, a service rep came and all he did was to replace the splitter and then he left. About three weeks ago, I received the modem for high speed internet, which I cannot use, but wish to use due to fact I do not have cable service. I am also being billed for high speed internet, but it is not even connected to the computer. I have told them many times when I was available at home, but no one has ever shown up. How many more months must I wait for service? How many more months must I pay for service, which does not exist?
__label__0 Comcast is the biggest mistake you will ever make. Service is beyond the worst in the industry. Their SLA's actually state that your satisfaction is not guaranteed and they are not responsible for any, yes, any problems and that they are not required to fix them. I live in Atlanta and if you aren't facing the right direction, Comcast is the only option. Their programming is by far the worst available and prices are by far the highest at $95.75/month versus twice the HD and channel options from Dish or DTV at $59.99 to include Sunday NFL ticket, all movie channels and all sports programming. Comcast is rated 15th out of 16 TV service providers in the country and number 16 is Charter, the same company, just a different name, different region. The problem is, they are all that's avail if you don't have a view of the south sky. Comcast should lock the doors and turn in the keys and walk away. I understand they have millions of customers so many complaints will be had but in a survey Comcast has lower than 38% customer satisfaction. DTV has 92% and DISH 74%.
__label__1 Hi All, Comcast Xfinity... Big fat liars. Comcast charged me $10.00 every month for the equipment they have not provided. When I realized that they over charging me every month, I reached out to Comcast. They said they are sorry and said they will refund me money back in 4 to 6 weeks. After 6 weeks they call me and says I owe them 30 plus dollars. Now I am chatting with them and they say they charged me for the equipment. I was given only setup TV box. They were also charging me for Modem which they never provided me.
__label__1 They have been over charging me for the past six months. I called in March 2015 and talked to ** and I thought it was resolved. I received my May bill and it has not been resolved. And they can not help me because I need to talk to A BILLING SUPERVISOR and they would not let me do so. I need to talk to a supervisor.
__label__1 I feel like Comcast should come and hook my services up.  I have been a longtime Comcast costumer.  When I called to get my services transferred, they knew I needed new wiring and they didn't say that I had to pay 50 dollars for an installation fee they set up to appointments. I feel like they should hook up my cable without charging me the 50 dollars.  I am not happy.
__label__1 Called Comcast regarding new service on 01/15/2017. The reason for my call was regarding a package which was promoted on their website regarding X1 Triple Play for 159.99 with a 2 yr contract or 169.99 without contract. I was mostly interested in the package for the internet speed which was 150mbps. I was not able to get the package due to my HOA which includes certain packages within bulk accounts. The representative sold me a package for $119.99 which included the promotion regarding the Triple Play and DVR was suppose to be included, TV Latino, and all additional channels.Two days later I received an email that my package is now $149.99 which has additional items needed to be paid separately. Always ask if the DVR, additional outlets, modem, are included within the package. Please make sure like I did to record your conversations, dates, times and names with every representative you speak too. I recorded my conversation which clearly the sales representative is lying regarding the options included and how much I will pay per month. I just contacted Comcast and I am suppose to receive a call back regarding the call with a solution within 48 hrs. I will report them to BBB, and the Federal Trade Commission pertaining their practices and if nothing is resolved I will hire an attorney. Be very aware of Comcast. They are the worst with over 4,000 reports.
__label__1 I upgraded my Comcast cable service from the basic service I get through my condo association in February, that was when I was told by their sales department that we would be getting digital service "within weeks" that would give me all sorts of improved services. Not only did they lie to me about when we would get the digital service (my condo association says it won't be until 2012), but they have had a known software problem with their DVR boxes (I have had the box changed twice) where you record something and when you go to play it back, you find out that the show didn't completely record. Sometimes it records for just a few minutes and sometimes stops halfway through and sometimes 5 minutes before the end. Now that my complaint has been "escalated", they have told me not to bother calling them because they already know there is a problem and they have no idea whatsoever when or if it will be resolved. I have instructed them not to even think about sending me a bill until the problem is fixed. I had DirecTV before but my condo association doesn't allow dishes anymore. So, my last resort is AT&T. At least I can get most of the shows on my computer for free at piratebay.org in the meantime.
__label__1 I called Comcast last week. I spoke to a rep named Patricia. She pretended to be very nice. I paid a past due bill and ordered new Comcast cable TV. She told me I was going to pay $69.95 for cable and internet service. Well, she lied. I called her back and told her I couldnt pay that amount and I needed a lower package. Well, she told me I could get the $49.95 with 100 channels also and its the same as with the $69.95 plan she told me before. When I called Comcast back, I was told that she had given me only basic cable, so I cancelled the order. Oh, and she asked me to pay another $55.00 which I did. Well, she lied to me. So I just cancelled the order, but they did not refund me the $55.00. Then I called again yesterday and spoke to Gerard **. He told me that a tech was going to come today within 9 am and 9 pm today, 4/12/12, and I was lied to again. I called them back and they told me someone was out here yesterday at 4:30 pm and they didnt have access to the meter room.So, I asked to speak to the supervisor Gerard ** at ext. number **. Well, he told me that someone would be coming on Monday, which is five days from now. They already charged me and I still dont have a cable connection. He bounced me around like a ball and they dont resolve my issue. I dont know whats going on here, but I do know that I have seen Comcast guys having conversation with tenants and they give them service, too. I just want my service put in so I could watch TV, but they are up to a lot of tricks and lies which are hurting a few customers while others get more channels without paying for it. I just want my service put in ASAP and not be lied to every time I call.
__label__1 Worst company ever I have dealt with which don't care about customer satisfaction. I have had internet service with them since 2 years and have instructed them I won't like to have any other service with them but they still push the bundle in my account without my permission and then charge extra for me. When I try to return extra device at local office then they don't take it and give promise my rates will stay the same but guess what? Rates went up by $11. Then I complained and instead of trying to adjust they justified the new rates. Once their technician comes out to service 15 minutes late then arrival time and by that time I have resolved the problem and already left for work. So the technician tell my wife that we won't get charged for it since he didn't had to do anything ant they still charged for $20. When I call them to reverse the charge again phone lady tries to justify the charges. I am so fed up with their service that I want to give up on them but I don't have any alternative in my area. I wish this Internet never have been discovered if such are the service provider I had to deal with. Totally rubbish ISP to have as Comcast.
__label__1 My Triple Play service was down when I came home from work on 12/23/15, because a tractor trailer came down my street and tore down the low hanging cable wire from the street to my house, that Comcast has promised to fix for 9 months but never did. Technician came out 12/24 to fix. Ran a new wire from pole to my house and connected. Came home from work and nothing working. Tech support said there was no signal coming from my cable box & modem. Called Comcast at 2 pm and they said nobody can come out till 12/27 to repair. Had no cable, internet, or phone on Christmas eve or Christmas day when I was home, because of their laziness. When they come out to fix it I'm going to refuse the service and cancel all of it. Then I will call DirecTV and just add more gb to my Verizon plan for internet service. This was the 3rd time this year a truck tore down my wire and they refused to fix it properly. Every time tech came out it was a "temporary fix". I'm so done with Comcast.
__label__1 My bill kept going up and I finally took the time to review all the services. I realized I was paying for a service that I never had, asked for or needed. I spent almost 2 hours trying to talk to someone, only to be transferred to non-Americans that I couldn't understand and that would eventually hang up in the middle of a statement. I can't get any answers and these are the worse people I've ever dealt with. I am looking for new service now. I would never recommend Comcast. They are a rip-off and increase your bill continuously. Thank you Comcast for destroying my nerves today.
__label__0 I have had comcast for about 7 years now while i have lived in California. I have just taken a position in Massachusetts and i had my wife to phone to cancel the service because we do not have an address to go to just yet, but also asked what happens to our account. My wife was put onto the service dept and told that it would be available for up to 30 days after cancellation before it was actually turned off. That was fine as it gave us 30 days to either go back to comcast once we have found a place to live or find someone else in the area if comcast was not available. i was asked to bring back the modem of which i did yesterdy in San Jose, only to be told it terminated as soon as i brought back my modem. I find this inconvienient and not of you integity, as i had been told by 3 persons the opposite of what you actually did to me. i have been with you for 7 years and am a man that tries my best to live by the truth, not lies and to be  told on what you call recorded for custoner training or whaever you call it and actually be lied to is far from fair when most of my interaction with customers and clients and also my family are through this email address is not what you live by and that is INTEGRITY.
__label__5 I posted a review on 1/22/13 about how Comcast was switching the pricing around on my bill from additional outlets to digital adapter service. 1/28/13 update: After several more phone calls to Comcast and long hold times, I finally talked to Paul from customer service who understood what I was talking about the first time I explained it to him. In just 5 (five) minutes, the problem was solved - charges removed from my bill and a note placed on my account.
__label__0 My wife Marie ** called Comcast a week and a half ago to get cable and internet access for our house. The internet seems to be not working and the person that came here that day from Comcast was not very helpful and did not offer to connect the internet or cable for me. I would greatly appreciate it if someone from Comcast could come by our house to see what the problem is as I need the internet for my work. I would very thankful if someone could contact me about this matter. Thank you.
__label__1 So many things have gone wrong with Comcast that I will not explain them all but what made my family and I stop their service was this. We were only paying for internet because we had Hulu, Netflix, and Xbox for entertainment purposes. We were paying $70 a month for their fastest service provided. Since I live in an apartment building, I figured that the slow speeds were from the many people on the service. It was getting bad, Hulu would freeze and Netflix would freeze. Finally, I called them after 3 months of this going on. I was told that there was a bad signal in my apt. and that a tech would come out. So the tech came out and there is a box in our apt called Honeywell where he looks in and says there are some damages inside and he was surprised it did not send a signal to Comcast telling them that it was not working right. So he got on our laptop and fixed it and said, "restart everything and all should be good." Well after he left, he came back because he forgot his tool bag and to top that off after he was already gone, I found that my laptop was no longer receiving a wireless signal so I called Comcast and asked them what he did. They said in order to fix it, I would need to pay to speak to a tech that could assist me. I was **, this guy came to my home and he uninstalled my wireless card on my laptop and Comcast wanted me to pay for them to fix my mistake and they said for it to be free, we would have to wait 3 days for a tech to come take a look. Thank God 3 hours later, I found out how to reinstall it. I also was mad they did not want to fix it. So when I got my bill that next month, I thought that the tech might have put a note stating that I had not been getting the service I was paying for for 3 months but no, everything was still the same. After seeing my bill, I contacted customer support live on their website and after 15min. of me telling the person what was going on and I did save to my computer the whole chat log, he stated, "We will refund you money from the point of when your service was interrupted." So I'm thinking, "great, I get 3 months pro rated" but then the next bill came and they gave me a $20 discount. Their equipment was faulty and even the tech said he couldn't believe that the computers couldn't pick up this error sooner.
__label__1 I received a letter that one of my boxes was old and I needed to replace. Went to channel and ordered new box, it arrived and when I hooked it up, it did not work. I called and they sent out service guy who said they send these out all the time and forget to activate! He had a smart phone and did the activation from that, very nice gentleman, he took my old box so I did not have to ship back. Then my bill came and they charged me $39, I called and complained and they said they could not remove even though their fault. She would give me half the charge in a credit, I said that was not acceptable since I was not at fault here. I asked to speak to her supervisor, she explained in that case, I can may not even get the 1/2 credit.. (unbelievable!) I said I still want to speak to her supervisor, then she put me on never ending hold.. after 27 minutes, I hung up and called back, explained my situation to another customer service rep who told me I would get a call from a supervisor as soon as one is available. Apparently, they are very busy because it has been 11 days and no call!!! I have never had such a horrible customer experience with any company like this in my life. Insane. So now, I am out the $39 on top of an insane monthly bill... I have already called DIRECTV and another internet service provider. I called to talk to them and they don't seem to care nor have they given me any credit for this or the 4 outages I had last month. One for 6 hours, both TV and Internet. Obviously, this company has grown too large to care about their customers and they have certainly proved that in my last 3 communications with them. I am still stunned by their rude interaction and complete incompetence or willingness to resolve this issue.
__label__1 Over the past three years we have continued to have a periodic loss of Channel 8 (GA PBS), either audio, video, or both. Four weeks ago, I reported the loss of audio to Comcast. Ten days later a technician came out and verified the loss. He was late to my appointment, because he left another residence nearby with the same fault... it was difficult to analyze using company equipment. In short, the trouble ticket was cancelled because it is beyond the repair capability of Comcast technical branch.After two weeks, I called to ask if the Engineering department was going to repair equipment at the head, where the signal is being transmitted throughout our region. My first call did not result in the expected supervisor call as promised. Forty five minutes later I made a second call, and the same result was obtained. No supervisor would speak to me.After thirty minutes of being placed on hold, the representative attempted to explain, without admitting Comcast will do nothing, it is beyond the technical group's ability; thus, I was offered a set of options I rejected. I repeated my original request, to speak to anyone, after making it clear I could either cancel Comcast service or submit to Comcast's unreasonable demands. Surprise, no call could be completed to their Loyalty Rewards Department, the representative told me; for me to cancel my service or discuss repairs.Comcast has not upgraded my area to digital, thus, DTA's will not work. We have direct cable feed. Purportedly, the huge cable box Comcast offers will resolve the problem. I assert the problem remains in the equipment interface between Comcast and GA PBS station itself. They refuse to fix that problem. No trouble ticket can be or will be created, as it will never reach the Engineering Department.Updated on 08/26/2015: We had significant thunderstorms beginning shortly after midnight. I reported problems around 5 A.M. Although I was told it was not an area-wide outage, and an appointment was scheduled, service was restored by 6 P.M. today -- about 13 hours. Further, I was called at about 4 P.M. to verify my appointment for tomorrow, indicating the automated message had not been cancelled with repairs near completion. I still believe it was an area-wide outage, but happy to have service restored.
__label__1 I have had the worst experience with Comcast and they are not even my service provider and NEVER will be. My father passed away in June and unfortunately had cable through Comcast. When I called to cancel his account, a very rude woman would not let me because I am not an "authorized user" on his account. Really?! He's dead! Why would you not let me cancel the account? She was extremely rude and said that it would be illegal to let me cancel because of federal law. If that was true, then why did Verizon Wireless and Farmer's Insurance let me cancel? Pretty sure if there was a federal law against it, then they wouldn't have let me either. She told me my only option was to fax or email the death certificate and gave me the information. Problem is, when I tried to email it, the email address came back invalid. Then, I tried to fax it multiple times and there was a busy/not responding message that came back every time. A month or so later, I was finally able to go to a Comcast location and cancel. Then, I get a bill from collections for my deceased father saying that he owes for services provided after he had already passed, because THEY WOULD NOT LET ME CANCEL IT!!! How crazy that now they want to be paid because of their terrible policies that would not let me cancel the account for almost 2 months after he passed? Absolutely ridiculous. I will NEVER use Comcast because of this situation. The customer service was horrible and they apparently enjoy ripping off and taking advantage of people who have lost their loved ones. Shame on you, Comcast!!!!
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer for over six years. I've called repeatedly asking questions about billing. I have been hung up on and disconnected. At this point, I cannot even have a customer service rep call me back. Not only will I report the local service to the Better Business Bureau, the company itself is part of the 1 percent - raping the poor, not answering phones call, charging extra, deliberately over charging ...
__label__1 Let me start off by saying, I have been with many cable companies in the past. Although I have had a few terrible experiences, NONE of them compared to the money-hungry monstrosity that is Comcast. Their customer service is beyond terrible and the employees are just plain rude and condescending. From "discounts" being promised, only to be billed for it later, to obscene amounts of money being thrown away every month, boycotts are in order. This company WILL NOT get another dime from me.
__label__1 We started with Comcast. 3 weeks later an installer had the chance to come out. He left with only 2 bedroom boxes on basic cable working. We called them repeatedly for the issue. Never had internet or the channels in our package. A week later they send a tech that got our master bedroom working on cable and internet. After peaking in the attic where they were working I noticed one of my roof trusses laying there. Guess he didn't have time to reinstall it. They offered nothing to us. I had to repair the remaining two cable outlets myself that weren't working because the tech sent out disconnected them to make only two rooms operate on basic. Xfinity is awful. We still have not received our original offer. If you have any other provider, choose wisely. We are in central Florida. Good luck.
__label__1 I was told by a customer representative, over the phone, that I would be paying for 25Mbps as part of their special promotion. They also told me that the promotion would end in 12 months with a 30 day money back guarantee. With good faith in the company, I continued to pay for 6 months under the impression I was getting just that. For awhile I thought slow speeds were a result of too many people in my apartment being on at once. However, after doing a few checks, I began to get suspicious and it turns out my internet had been changed to 3Mbps for months now. It seems that if it's not in writing, they can say anything to get you to fork your money over. I will be canceling their service after this billing period. What an awful sales tactic.
__label__1 This is only the third review I have written (the first two were positive), but I have to share my negative experiences with Comcast. I should have noted the red flag and fled to a more reliable company after my first call to Comcast... It was an inquiry about the different packages available and the price. I was on the line for over an hour - on and off of hold - and I didn't get any information. The agent told me she would call back with the information, and she did not.The next day (Sunday) I called again and was quickly able to get a price and schedule installation (I don't know what the woman was doing the previous day while I was on hold!). When I scheduled installation for the earliest date (five days later on the Friday), I explained that my contractor would meet the Comcast technician. The Comcast agent told me the technician would call thirty minutes before arriving. At this point, I emphasized that this was essential because the contractor might need to collect materials. The technician did not call until he was waiting at the front door. When my contractor told him he would be ten minutes, he said he could not wait. I called the technician back a few hours later and he was very rude and unhelpful. When I asked for his name he hesitated and then said, "Bob." Clearly an intelligent chap...such a convincing lie! I called him out on the lie and he said he wasn't allowed to give me a name. So...back to the delightful task of trying to get through the minefield that is the automated call system to complain to an agent! I eventually reached an agent, and was placed back on hold. The call lasted for one hour and a technician was not scheduled. She told me she would call me back that evening as soon as she had managed to schedule a technician to come out. Of course, there was no callback. 90 minutes later I called Comcast AGAIN, and spoke with another rude and unhelpful representative. She could not reschedule a technician for another five days. I asked to speak with a supervisor, she told me they would not be able to help. I said I would like to cancel my account, and that I would be reviewing my negative experience, and she said okay. There was absolutely no effort to compensate for the poor service and no apology; this resulted in a terminated account. Recommendations for new providers are welcome... :) In short, DO NOT even attempt to join Comcast; their customer service is non-existent!
__label__0  I would have never had taken 1/2 day off of work for this phone install nor would I have signed up for the triple play.  When I asked them to change me back to what I had they told me they could not.  Now I have a phone I don't want and also they falsely told me I was going to get a free Wii. I took 1/2 day off of work which really was turned out to be more then 1/2 day with all the additional phone calls. I now have a phone I do not want and cannot get my old modem back I had with Patriot Media.
__label__1 After being a customer with Comcast for 10+ years I called to see if I can change my service plan as I was no longer working. The agent on the line said as of July I was under another 2 year agreement and could not change or cancel my plan. I asked when I signed a contract and she said they Sent me an email with the discount they have given me and that is now my contract to lock me in for another 2 years. She would not put me on the phone with a supervisor instead she said someone will call me within 24 hours. I have been in customer service for 27 plus years and never seen such service. All the negative reviews say a lot!!!
__label__0 Seriously? I've been a customer for 15+ years. I've been through so many DVRs (refurbished, my butt). Called, emailed, went to local office, they always have some problem, specifically not working. Yet they still charge me month after month. Discounts for crappy service? Nope. Going to DirectTV.
__label__1 I called because my internet was running slow. They said I could take it to the store and swap it out. I don't really have time to do that but they insisted they would be charging me if they had to send one out. It got a little better for a while and started acting up again. When I called the first time they advised me there was a known issue in my neighborhood, but there was only two customers and that wasn't enough for them so send someone out. So I call back 6 months later. Same issue and my bill almost doubled after the first year - $55.00 to $95.00. I understand an annual increase but 5-10 dollars should be enough. They told me if I didn't agree to free phone or TV I would have to stay at $95.00 a month. I do not want the free services. I want what I have for a fair charge. That guy was terrible.I was then sent to a woman who said she was going to charge me to send out a box. I finally got her to agree to do it for no charge since there is a known issue. 2 weeks later all that has showed up is new cables. I called to ask when the box would show up and was advised the request was never put in. "Ok, so put it in please." "Sure but that is going to cost you." "No, no it's not." She sent me to someone else who was magical. She APOLOGIZED. She put in for someone to come out next day and put a small credit on the account for maybe $20.00. She even let me choose my service window for Saturday, 08:00-10:00. 10:01 rolls around and I am on the phone with Comcast. "Is he still coming?" "Yeah he was running a little late and changed it to 10:00-12:00." Thanks for the call and the heads up geez.He gets out there which wasn't too much later, I understand but you could call. He tells me there is nothing wrong with my box, I just have really slow internet. So I call and say, "I need to upgrade my internet." He says, "Why? You are already getting 75 down..." "No, your tech just said I have 35 down..." So we are back to the area issue. I am paying for 75 down but getting 35 down, sweet. They said you pay for up to 75 down but since I don't ever get that, why aren't I charged for up to 40? This has been a nightmare. I called in when I got my invoice because I had requested to speak to a supervisor 3 times with a promise of a callback within 24-48 hours. It has been weeks.I got this invoice and due to the problem still not being fixed and not having a supervisor call me back I asked for the bill to be credited as a 1x we are sorry and want to keep your business peace offering. They advised me unless I turn in the box or pay for another tech to come out they can not and will not. It has to be fixed before they will credit a future invoice. It is a never ending circle. I get it you bill in advance, but what about all the past issues. It has been a stage 5 event and I hate Comcast. 2 out of the 10 people act like they have a soul and it is a shame. Jesus take the wheel when it comes to this company. They are terrible and have very minimal customer service. I never thought I would say this but, you get nicer people and better people at Verizon... And they are the devil. Worst company out there.
__label__1 After several months of increased fees and cost and failed attempts to reduce the Comcast cost, I was forced to cancel their service. During this conversation I was given a date it would be cancelled and told that my e-mail would still be good for 60 days. 6 days later, my e-mail access was denied. After numerous hours, phone calls, text conversations and visiting a store 60 miles away, the only thing Comcast can say is that they made a mistake, that the communication of their representatives was uninformed and that they can do nothing to restore my 5 years of lost e-mails stored. One representative told me he could offer a reduced price to sign back up with them while another told me he could do nothing unless I provided proof of who I was and a death certificate proving that my mother died as her name was on the account. Unimaginable statements that you simply can't make up. 2 customer service representatives stated that they are in agreement that their company's approach is unethical and lacks any compassion for the customer. I was given the name and number of the manager for customer service in the regions... Sheri ** in Philadelphia. Her number is **. I called several times, left messages and she never returned my calls. Not once.They have cost me countless hours of my time, lost tickets that I cannot retrieve for a scheduled chaperoned trip with my daughter and her schoolmates to DC as well as lost business/personal information that I simply can not replace. The stress, frustration, and disbelief of how I've been treated and how my situation was handled is through the roof. They lie, have no idea how to solve difficult problems and seem indifferent to real issues. I am hoping the Mr. Roberts, the CEO reads this as well as his recently appointed customer service VP, Charlie Herrin. If they do, they would have the decency to look into this debacle.
__label__1 X1 box locks up, no response to remote control, internet gateway restarts intermittently. TV picture pixelated so badly it can't be watched. Comcast's fix is "reboot" that fixes nothing.
__label__5 I have two HD TVs, each with cable boxes. One has "RNG150" above the power button; the other "RNG150N" on the lower right hand front corner. Changing channels using the "RNG150N" box takes 3-5 seconds, resulting in a series of black screens and sometimes a grey screen. The "RNG150" box has no problem changing channels. I have swapped the boxes between the two TVs and the result using the "RNG150N" box is the delay in channel change. I have complained to Comcast for almost a year now, requesting that they replace the "RNG150N" box with a "RNG150". They claim they can't because they don't know if they have one in the service center or with a tech.
__label__1 Since we have gotten the adapters that we must use with our cable service, our picture has been distorted. These boxes negate the service that we should be getting from Xfinity/Comcast as well as the capabilities of our sets. We are told that we will now need an additional digital box at $9.99 per month in order to get the quality of service that we previously had. I think this should be illegal and, at the very least, unethical. This, combined with the overall service of Xfinity, needs to be addressed.
__label__1 My mom has Comcast Cable. I help my mother pay the bill. We never missed a monthly payment. Bill was paid on time every month but for some reason bill never got lower only high... I moved to a new location in February. I had to wait for them to get a date to transfer my services here where it get interesting. They wanted like 4 month to transfer a balance from my old address to my bill and because they wanted so long to do this my bill is skys the limit. I feel it should be a law against company prorating people bill because they don't how much cable someone going to watch for the month. Something need to be done about how much they charge people to watch cable. Company need to realize not everyone work and some people are on a fix income so to charge all the money for cable make no sense. I feel like they should be put on some time of investigation because when you pay a bill it suppose to go down not get higher when you put money on it.
__label__1 This is the worst company I have EVER dealt with! Their internet and TV are unworkable. Technical support is all in India. They do not understand anything. The phone system hangs up on you after telling you that your zip code has no service even though you are receiving service at that zip code. The most incompetent company on the face of the earth. From products to service, they are an abomination. Stay as far away from this company as you can!
__label__0 I called to have an HD box installed in the bedroom, when the technician arrived looking like a gangster he had no idea why he was there. The tech had no idea how to hook it up. He called customer service and they could not help him. In the mean time all my T.V's went off and no one knew why they went out or how to get them working again. I had to schedule another appointment which was was 4 days later. I have a bulk where I live so I have no choice for my cable provider. Comcast started charging for service calls for bulk customers with the understanding that if it was a problem with the equiptment the customer would not be charged, that is a joke because they will always say the equiptment was fineit was the customers TV. 
__label__1 You can spend hours on the phone with Comcast and get no problems resolved. They ask you for all your information then transfer you to someone that can not help you after getting all your information. Then that person puts you on hold and then disconnects you. So you call back again and start that process all over again. Don't get RJ (**); Demetrius (**); Denise (**) Adriane ** (**) or Laura (F squiggly line at top of your computer 4) because they are going to waste two hours of your time. Even after you go into their office no one can get your correct address in their system. Finally someone can disconnect your security service but they will charge you $1100 disconnection fee that no one ever bothered to mention.
__label__1 Update to my previous post... a year and half later we had to move due to a house fire.. I moved in with a friend. I cancel my service with them as I obviously no longer need it in a burnt house. I return the DVR box (not sure it would work after the fire but they wanted it).I call for final bill. I sent in the balance over 2 or 3 payments due to financial issues after the fire. The last final payment was made a year ago! - Last month I get a collection letter! I call Comcast telling them My balance was paid in full a year ago!!!???? Yes, it looks like I have a zero balance on my account. They tell me to call collections and they have an $83 change on my account for paying my bill late!!They knew of the fire and they knew I had to send payments... then they bill me a year later in a collections account letter!!! It is in dispute and probably on my credit report now..
__label__1 We returned a cable modem as we decided to use our own modem and drop the monthly $7.00 fee Comcast charges. We took the equipment to the local service center and did receive a receipt which we currently have. We are still being billed even though we returned the cable modem and have jumped through hoops calling and faxing the receipt to different department. We are still being billed! We are trying to figure out how to resolve this with Comcast and to stop charging us monthly for returned equipment.
__label__0 I am a new customer and took cable TV services from Comcast in mid Jan 2008. Meanwhile I took Internet services through Comcast offers ($19.95/month) in the month of Feb 2008.   Problems: 1. I am still being charged for $42.95/month for internet. I was asked to submit the mail-in-rebate forms for the $19.95/m offer to start. In-spite of sending the mail-in-rebate to Comcast, I am being charged $42.95.   2. During the month of March, Comcast was upgrading the cables in my area and I was without internet service for 3 weeks in a row after the upgrade was completed. In-spite of regular follow-ups, no one was able to fix the problem. Only after escalating the issue, the issue was addressed. During these 3 weeks I have lost lot of time, peace of mind and money.  3. I was told that I'll not be charged for the duration I did not have the services, but I have the bill in my hand now and I do not see any discounts.  4. Whenever I call 1-800-comcast either the call is disconnected or they try to misguide me. had to disturb my friends during night because I had to send some emails. I use Vonage and I was without phone for 3 weeks. It was a huge risk as I did not have anyway to reach my pregnant wife at home. I had to travel every day to my office (in New York) even though I wanted to work from home when my wife was not feeling well. Every day follow-up with Comcast was painful and mental torture.
__label__1 2 - 3 weeks ago I started having problems with my internet. Sometimes it would work perfect and I would get 70MB+ download speed, other times it would drop to ~2MB I work from home and I am constantly using Skype to stay in touch with co-workers and clients, you can do this with 2MB d/l. I immediately followed the normal, try to unplug the wireless modem and plug it back in, no change. I called in and used their automated system to reset the modem, no change. I had a modem that was not being rented from Comcast so they were reluctant to send a service tech out to help and pretty much just blamed the problem on the modem. I called the modem provider followed their troubleshooting, no change.. they assured me the problem was with ComcastHere comes the fun part. I decide to get a modem from Comcast so I can get a tech out to resolve the problem. I have three options: 1. Get it shipped for $10, 2. Have it delivered and installed by a tech for $50, 3. Pick it up myself for free. Being the kind of person that likes to save money, I go with option 3. The woman at Comcast I spoke to told me I could go to their Leominster MA location (I live in NH). When I get to the Comcast service center I am told that their modems are for MA residents only. Great. First Big issues.Finally, I get a Comcast modem back to my house, get it all set up and turn on my wi-fi devices. Not only do I experience the same problem, but now it is much, much worse. I reconnect my personal modem and call to have a tech come out to resolve the problem, this was on a Friday. They explained a tech would be out Monday to fix the problem, but the fun part is they could not give me ANY time frame, just sometime Monday and they will call before they show up.Monday comes around it's noon and still no word. I get on Comcast chat support and they assure me someone will be here as scheduled 4 oclock comes around, I get on Comcast chat, they assure me someone will be here as scheduled. No one ever showed. Now Im mad. First thing Tuesday morning I give Comcast a call. They never rescheduled an appointment after the one missed Monday, and they refuse to set me up a same day appointment. The only time he could offer me was Wednesday between 9am-12am (at least its not a 24 hour window). He scheduled it and I told him I needed to talk to his manager, he understood and told me I would receive a call from his manager with 1-2 hours. The manager never called.On Wednesday morning I receive a voicemail from Comcast confirming my appointment for between 6pm  7pm What the actual **. 5:25pm comes around and the tech pulls up in front of my house, sits in his van for 35 minutes until 6pm (my two big dogs were not pleased). He comes in my house for about 10-15 minutes plugs his stuff into my modem, checked to make sure the wire wasnt loose and says it seems normal, and that they will be back the next day (Thursday) to replace the line from the telephone pole to my house. The guy literally did nothing else.All day Thursday no one came surprise, surprise. Here we are today on Friday I get in touch with a person from Comcast, nothing was scheduled for anyone to come out to my location and resolve my issue. They tell me that I should expect a call from a tech to schedule another appointment. I won't hold my breath. Comcast has left a permanent bad taste in my mouth. This is literally the worst customer service I have EVER received. It is amazing your company is still in business.
__label__1 We received a telemarketing call from a company representing the new Xfinity package from Comcast. They promised 2 years of all premium channels, hi-speed internet and a landline for less than we were paying for just cable (with HBO and Starz) and Hi-speed internet. They promised that we could hook all of the components up ourselves and that they would be shipped out that day. After about 10 days, we did get a box with 2 cable boxes (one DVR and one basic), and a modem. My husband installed everything according to the instructions and nothing happened. We called customer service and they scheduled a technician for 4 days later. The technician got the main TV working and we thought the bedroom TV worked, but it didn't. It just says it is connecting and no matter how many times you unplug or reset it, nothing changed. So, we called again and got another technician who got it working. 3 days later, the bedroom TV is still not connecting. I called on Wednesday and the earliest a tech is available is Saturday. There was a time when you could call Comcast and a person (local) would answer the phone. Their customer service was awesome. This is no longer the case. If you are lucky enough to get a person in the US, they never have any record of previous calls and never have solutions other than to schedule another tech. It hasn't been 30 days yet but I'm ready to chuck all their equipment through their front door.
__label__1 I lost my job in August and called to disconnect my services. I told them I was aware there was going to be a balance on the account from the current month and I would not be able to pay it right away due to losing work. The rep said she understood and told me she unauthorized any payments to come out of that account and we made arrangements for my equipment to be returned. However, I have had TWO payments try to come out EVERY MONTH since then (it's now October) creating hundreds of dollars in returned item fees. Have called several times. Four times today actually. Every rep tells you a different answer on how the process works. The first one told me they didn't see any payments coming out at all (I can clearly see two returned items from Comcast on 10/09/15 and 10/16/15). The second rep told me she would submit a ticket and send me a confirmation email to take into my bank asking them to reverse the charges. The third was a very rude male who stated that's not the way things work and I would have dispute with bank because as long as there is a balance on the account and they have a bank account number they are authorized to take any payment they want, and when I asked to speak with a supervisor he hung up on me. The fourth has kept me on hold for the last twenty minutes BUT she's a lot nicer. Just kidding, she hung up on me too! On to the fifth rep... every time I get someone I think will be able to help me they put me on hold and then hang up. I'm beyond disappointed. I was a loyal customer, had this service for around two years, made payments on time, and then something bad happens to me and they do this... I will never use Comcast services again. EVER. This has been the worst experience. TERRIBLE SERVICE. TERRIBLE TRAINED REPS. THE INTERNET IS SLOW. Now they are telling me it was a payment made by check/phone and they are considering it fraud. Who in the H*** commits fraud paying someone's bills??? It's called an unauthorized charge taken by the merchant! OMG. Just leave my flipping account alone!!!
__label__1 I moved in to a new apartment in January of this year. Part of the move-in package was a flyer for comcast service, advertising special pricing on their plans for the whole complex. I called in and spoke to a guy who was pretty rude to begin with, and he explained that there was a $30, $40, and $50 options (typical good better best). I chose the $40 plan and he told me the soonest they could come out was a week and half away... Okay... I scheduled the install for as early as they go, 8 am. I had to leave for work by 11. The installer brought a "trainee" and had him setup the system instead. Not a big deal, except the guy clearly didn't know what he was doing and they kept running into "problems with the wiring" of my apartment. Whatever. It took them 3 hours and 3 separate modems to find one that was compatible with my apartment. Funny, I thought they worked with the whole complex? My first bill was $130. This apparently was including a $15 per hour rate for each installer. NOT OKAY. Second bill, $50. What?? I went along paying it, happy to just have the internet, until July when my bills went up to $75. I could NOT afford that. At that point, my roommate had bailed on our lease and I was paying everything by myself anyways. I opened a chat with a rep and they told me I was on a "promotional period" that was only for 6 months. I read over all my paperwork from my install and my bills and nowhere, freaking nowhere, did it ever say promotional or mention what my bills would be afterwards. I still had two months on my lease so I couldn't cancel, but I was pissed. I called in finally this week to cancel (they advertise 24/7 service but not for their cancellation dept) and spoke to a rep. Nicest person I talked to in the whole experience, and also an idiot. He repeated questions, took twenty minutes for the whole process, and kept asking me about my personal life and why I was moving. He also told me that I was going to be billed for the month I moved out anyways?? Comcast is billing me $75 for the month of September after I called and said my last day will be August 31st. He said they will send me a check with the amount left after what service I used. I'M NOT USING IT THE WHOLE MONTH??? What the hell!! Greedy jerks is all I can say.
__label__1 My Comcast cable box last night went into de-programmed mode by itself and would only receive Spanish language, could not change it back to English, tried many times, reverted on its own with no help from Comcast. I had to take the box into the Comcast center today and get a new box and remote. Both had to be reprogrammed with about two hours to make the basics work. Then an hour or more on the phone with tech support. The channels with the X-1 new box do not match the old cable box channels.I need a channel guide with the actual channels and what is located on them (for local reception) sent to me in the mail so I can decrypt how things line up in HD. With just getting the box today (X-1), the remote does not operate as did the last one. So we are pressing the remote channel # that are not related to what we were previously watching seeing with the old remote. There is no set of instructions included on how to use the remote other than the basics and not instructions on how to troubleshoot problems. No user guide for the cable box. Just the box and the remote with electric cables.The person in tech support tried to help and provide but was not always clear on what was going on at my end (confused, possible language issue), and did not have a concept of the previous non-functioning box and this new one and the dissociation between the two, also the difference with the new remote which is not user friendly.My problem is that we pay near $240.00 a month for service that is poor with a phone system with delays, breaks in service, God help us if the power goes off, we are dead in the water, and an internet that is not as fast as published. The ping test says something else, that what we are seeing on our end with speed and consistency is not what they show in the test. The TV works but there are delays getting to channels and again it is not user friendly without any instructions, and a lack of a good channel guide that can be easily downloaded with the actual channels that are in our area. We think the service is too expensive for what we get and I cannot understand why the government with all the complaints that have been filed has not done something to get us rebates from Comcast since the cost is way more than I think it should be for what services we receive.
__label__0 I have been calling Comcast almost on a daily basis, as I am receiving a terrible signal to my television. Numerous techs have been to the house and have confirmed that the problem is not with my system but outside my home. Additionally, one tech confirmed that my entire neighborhood has been having the same trouble. I am paying for a service that I am not receiving. I take time out of my daily schedule to meet with the techs. I am completely frustrated and feel I have no power over my own products and that someone else is controlling my life.
__label__1 I am receiving billing for charges I have already paid. When I go to log in for further information they say that my log in and password are not valid even though I had just established one. This is confusing and raises doubts as to their record keeping. I would choose another server, but I still have time on my contract. So I'm stuck and unable to get answers from XFINITY.
__label__1 I tried to sign up for Comcast service when I moved into my new apartment. Really, I tried three times. I signed up online for a package and was told that the equipment would be shipped to me. It never arrived, so I called a week later to be told that it had now been shipped and would arrive in days. I called again a week later to be told that NOW it would be shipped. I finally called a fourth time, still after receiving no equipment but after receiving a bill for $72, and was told it had never shipped. I asked them to cancel my account.I then received a bill for over $312 and numerous phone calls demanding I return the equipment, which of course I did not have. I finally wrote an email to the collection agency (yes, they turned in over in less than 30 days) demanding that they cease and desist--I never heard from them again. I also notified Comcast by phone and was assured once again that the bill was zeroed and that I would be receiving a zero bill soon. In the meantime, my husband went on the Comcast forum and discussed the situation with a rep there, who also assured us that he had personally seen to it that the bill was zeroed.This morning, I went to the local Comcast office because I have not received a zero bill in the mail so I have nothing in writing. I was told that the person or people who handle billing were not available today. I asked for a balance on my bill and was told it was $41. I then tried to call the 800 number for a record-breaking 7th time. I received a young woman who barely spoke English. I asked to be transferred to the United States. She transferred me to the Philippines. I asked again to be transferred to the United States and was told no. I asked if she was refusing to transfer me to the US and she said, "Yes." I terminated the call. At this point, I am not sure what to do. The only reason I am giving a one-star review is because you cannot give no-star reviews.
__label__0 I'm tired of comcast Reps trying to get me to pay a month in advance it does not make sense and if any other companies are doing this it should be stopped!  It is a form of harrassment the economy is bad right now. If you are late getting the bill they disconnect your service with out warning.when comcast disconnect your service it mess up the coloration of the picture and a off set of the picture tube which damages your TV.
__label__0 The flipping digital box doesn't work. It won't program, and I am sick of the 22 other channels that they let me get. I tried 6 times to call and program the box and all it gives me is channel 1234 of one moment please.
__label__0 Comcast has moved four channels from my service to digital only requiring me to purchase or rent a converter in order to receive them.  Comcast should either reduce its fee for my service OR add four replacement channels - such as Fox Business Network for  those of us who do not have to deal with multiple boxes next to TV sets and multiple remotes to access channels.  I am a long standing customer of Comcast but I am seriously considering switching to satellite, and I know others that feel strongly about this who may not send a complaint before leaving Comcast.
__label__1 I decided to overcome my difficulty with AT&T and poor service and switch to Comcast's XFinity Complete Triple Play package a couple of weeks ago. Sales took order with no problem and scheduled installation for a week later on a Sunday. I never received an order confirmation. Technician was supposed to call 30 minutes before arriving within their 2-hour window. He never called, just came a knockin'. First question, what equipment was I suppose to get?! They had no idea what equipment or service I had ordered despite showing me an order invoice from Comcast. They spent 45 minutes outside my house at the curb sorting out their boxes and picking ones to bring into my house. I was supposed to receive with the package two DVR and two HD boxes. The DVR boxes were supposed to 'share' their signal with the other equipment in none DVR rooms. However, I have come to find out that this is not the case in my area despite the advertising of such a product. I also found out that the iPad/iPhone app would not work with the equipment either. In Houston, the 4th largest population in the USA! False advertising! Next, the first tech of the two that arrived at my home for the installation left. He left me with a gentleman who obviously used English as his second language. This would not be such a problem except I really wanted to be able to communicate well and understand the equipment once installed. As it was, he came into my house with equipment that was scratched, marked, and dented. Apparently it had not even been reconditioned from previous use. I spoke to his supervisor who could have cared less and was only concerned about whether I wanted to cancel or reschedule. I cancelled the installation. Next, I spent the afternoon and Monday afternoon on the phone trying to get what I had ordered only to be told that they didn't offer the DVR shared in each room as advertised and that they always utilized equipment usually returned from former customers. They made no offer to encourage me to continue with my order. I finally made the decision to quit the order and have my phone number ported back to AT&T to continue with their lousy service. I felt like I was stepping from one hot skillet into an even hotter one. It would appear that Comcast has not improved its customer service. Time spent on the phone was worthless and accomplished nothing. Even contacting the VP of Customer Operations did nothing. Their attitude is horrible as they continue to purport they are the top customer service and communication company in the country. Well, they need to take a deep breath and step back and realize they aren't and they have big problems. A new customer willing to spend $220/month and they can't treat that customer with respect. They also can't be honest in their advertising. Shame on them! They have lost my business forever! I cancelled my order and prevented installation of any equipment. Comcast made no effort to reconcile or satisfy my request.
__label__1 I was looking to add HD service to my account. Comcast's website shows the products in my area (they ask for your zip to give you quotes). The site says it's $6.50 a month plus a $15 setup fee. When you try to order the service online, you're forced to chat with one of their so-called 'customer service agents' who tells you the service costs $8 a month and the setup fee is $20. If you point out that they advertise otherwise, they tell you 'prices are subject to change'. What the **? This is fraudulent, plain and clear bait and switch advertising.
__label__1 I was just informed that there will be a substantial "disconnection fee" and 60 days notice to terminate my service. I have called Comcast twice today only to be put on Hold for 45 minutes each time. I finally reached a representative only to give me that bad news that I wasn't even aware of. She said she would send me the agreement, which is signed electronically.... They NEVER advised me that there was a disconnect fee!!!!!! Small print I guess... The rep said she would send over the paperwork to cancel and she did not!!! I have been all over the website and there is NOT ONE link to do so!!! NOW WHAT?
__label__1 Comcast uses refurbished internet equipment for most of their services. Comcast told me that my gateway will only last 2 months, then I will have to replace it. I already replaced it 3 times.
__label__1 Comcast, a company only out to get money. I say this because I feel that this company, from since we started with them in 2013 has always over charged us, made us waste time waiting on them to come to our home to get service and even when we were going through hardships and couldn't pay the full bill, has no courtesy for us and didn't want to work with us. I spoke to a supervisor named **, he was so arrogant and came up with some solution to only give me service for one day and then had the guts to tell us that he is going to charge us 2 reconnection fees. I Was very frustrated with him and just decided to cut the service off completely. I dealt with this bs service for too long. I would never recommend this company to anyone, I will tell everyone to go with At&t and just avoid ever going to comcast. I Hate them with a passion.
__label__1 Had a tech. Supervisor come with reg tech for a long time issue after they left all but one of my five TVs were not working and the Customer service jerk would rather ague with me than send tech. Said that there are NO tech available after telling me that he could if my issue was more serious. If you have a choice DO NOT USE THIS GARBAGE COMPANY! Once again we regular people are victims of MONOPOLY COMPANIES. Just like Airlines. There is your Big Government at work. These Corp. no doubt have to have our leaders in their pocket. Just try and get Good Service and Good Customer Service.
__label__1 After having the installation it became clear the salesman had NO working knowledge of technology side of the business. The salesman also gave a quote that was far off. For example, the installation was supposed to be $19.95 (Special promotion, he said), but ended up being $35. Then I was told I could use my own modem (I specifically asked if it would be compatible). He resoundingly said it would work just fine -- WRONG! That's another $10, plus tax, a month for the Xfinity/Comcast modem (Or you can purchase one from Best Buy for $200). In addition, there is almost $25 of extra fees/taxes, not including the sales tax! Just ridiculous!I was reassured emphatically that the amount at the bottom of the page was the final charge plus the normal sales tax - the great promotion they had going, he said. THEN to top it all off, when I called and spoke to a sales representative (assuming it was all just a billing mistake), not only did they do NOTHING to fix the bill (in fact the charges were defended), but the woman PURPOSELY gave me the wrong date of 30 new install termination so I would have to pay the $230 early termination fee. Also, shockingly, an hour later my conversation with the sales representative all of our on-demand disappeared -- the system said we were not subscribed -- of which was supposed to be part of the promotion I signed up for... Coincidental? My gut knows better. Comcast is the worst company I have ever dealt with, completely unethical and shady. I am going back to Dish.
__label__5 I have been a customer of Comcast Business Class for about 10 years. Currently I pay $125/month for service with static IP addresses. I have been extremely happy with the service up until about October 2013. The service became very slow from 20Mb/s down to 1Mb/s (upload was 5Mb/s to 0.2Mb/s). I am constantly resetting their cable modem to get a temporary fix. Comcast replaced the modem but the condition still persists. A call today to Comcast resulted in a sales pitch. They suggested that for another $15/month I could get 50Mb/s download and 10Mb/s upload. I just want what I used to get. It appears that they have oversold bandwidth and are rationing services, or they are purposely causing the problem in order to sell customers into higher priced plans.
__label__0 I have been waiting on a refund since I moved out of Tower 2000, Apartment ** on August 2009 because of a military reassignment. I have called a number of times for the refund of over $200. A customer ticket number was assigned, which is **. The problem I have is if I owed money, I would have been turned over to a collection agency. In this case CASCOM is earning interest on my money which is a problem. I request an inquiry of why it takes CASCOM so long to refund customers.
__label__1 I attempted to initiate service with Xfinity last week. It has taken me over 5 hours of phone calls to try to get service. I still do not have any. Initially, the customer service agent failed to take my e-mail, explain to me the new landline number, and took my last name incorrectly. I was supposed to receive a self install shipment of supplies. The shipment never came. Luckily, I called to check on the status. After being on hold for 25 minutes I was told that the order never took place. I waited another 25 minutes for a supervisor. The equipment was received the following day. I waited on hold 20 minutes to speak to an activation representative. Then waited another 25 minutes to be called back by the same rep. The activation was unsuccessful and I waited another 30 minutes to speak to a supervisor. This has been followed by approximately another 75 minutes in phone calls to supervisors who attempt to give you their word that your issue will be resolved, but in reality, you are one of over 20 million customers whom they provide service to. Your business means nothing to this company. They have a sales and representative force that is poorly skilled and overwhelmed. It is truly sad to think that this is the state of customer service in 2015. I have been met with a litany of inexcusable, incompetent service thus far. What began as a simple phone call to start service has turned into the worst and most time consuming lack of customer service experience I have ever experienced. If there was another option in my area, I would rapidly flee to it. Any other provider, DirecTV, Dish, Time Warner, etc. would be a welcome choice. I DO NOT recommend Comcast Xfinity based on my statements above. Simple fact is that they have too many customers, a poorly skilled customer service force, and are unable to accommodate the volume or service area this billion dollar company has taken on.
__label__1 I have had Comcast Xfinity for about a year and technicians have been to my house over TEN times. They change the cable boxes almost every time they come. They were here a week ago and now they are coming back to change the box AGAIN. I'm so fed up with them, I'm going to cancel my plan and if they ask me to pay a penalty, I will sue them. This is the most horrible cable company I've ever had.
__label__1 Hello out there. I thought my irritation and anger would subside if I tried to calm down but that did not work and my anger is even worse now. Comcast customer service representatives and the young man, Mario, I spoke with at the corporate office really need to take a class in communication and every one at Comcast, from the corporate level down to the customer service level, need to take a class in customer appreciation so that they could try to understand that if Comcast did not have any customers their business would go belly up and shut down! Being told "stop trying to give Comcast the shaft and pay your bill, Ms. **" is not professional in any way!!!! REALLY, this is the way Comcast customer service talks to one of their customers, me, who is a Comcast "insider". How do they talk to their regular customers?When you charge $200 plus a month for your triple play and, yes my bill is late a lot but I do pay it, and I pay it with the income I receive from social security disability in the amount of approximately $600 per month. I do everything in my power to pay my bill because I enjoy watching television that is more than just 6 or 7 channels that does not even include CBS which is a regular free network channel that I am watching through a digital box and an antenna. Don't get me wrong I am grateful for the digital box because I can see something.Now I talked to Mario at the corporate after being insulted, a number of times, by customer service representatives only to be insulted by Mario. I have explained my situation to this young man and a number of representatives with them showing me no compassion and being told there is nothing that CORPORATE can do to help me out so I thought, maybe, contacting the Better Business Bureau and anyone else I can then maybe someone at the corporate office could do something to help me out. You maybe wondering what is my situation as well as why should Comcast help me out as well as so many other customers who are having issues due to financial hardships in this economy. My situation is in late June I was in a horrific car accident and to help my body heal and stay alive I was put into a medically induced coma. After two and a half months of being in the hospital I was released on September 13, 2014 and came home to my Comcast service disconnected due to non-payment as well as payments that were made using my checking account that had no money in it. The returned checks and their fees jacked my bill up to approximately $1500 that's including $150 deposit to get my service back on. Now I was in a coma so there is no way that I made those payments so how much assistance have I received from Comcast? NONE, that's how much. Not only that but I paid $700 on Monday, September 22, 2014 and it is conveniently not in their system. REALLY COMCAST!!!!!!!!! I keep going back to Comcast because DirecTV and AT&T are just as bad and if I don't have to talk to anyone at Comcast then everything is fine. Oh did I mention that I came back to Comcast when I moved in October of 2011 and my phone and internet have not worked properly since I came back and my modem has been switched out at least 7 times? Why do I keep coming back? Because I'm an idiot!! Comcast, is there anything you can do for me now? Or do I still have to pay $1500 to a corporation who is a monopoly and worth over $100 billion? I'm sure $1500 is not going to bankrupt you!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 When I was with Comcast they coerced me to set up two accounts so I went from just Residential to Residential and Business. My bill skyrocketed and I was double charged for things like the phone, which was on both plans but bundled, so I paid for it twice. I had so many problems with them and because of the cost I switched to another vendor. I just received a bill this morning for $3,027.78 and I was floored, to say the least. I called them as soon as I could and discussed this with them and they did not budge. When I ended service with them I was not told about any loophole that would cost me this kind of money or I couldn't and wouldn't disconnect with them. The amount itself is incredibly high, even if in the fine print, which most people trust and don't read, if they are like me. The charge was over $2,500 and I suppose late fees incurred as I don't remember getting a bill or didn't open their campaigns to get me back until this morning.Compared to the average household income they are taking about 8% of annual income or one month's income for most people. This is flat morally/ethically wrong to have any company rape you like this. It is usury and not at all within reasonable limits. Signed, Disgusted with Comcast and their BUNDLING??? service???
__label__1 I started out with only home security and wifi with Comcast. An independent contractor with comcast sold me on adding cable services to my existing account for only $30 extra per month - that was 30 days ago. My services have only worked for maybe 10 days out of the 30. They have sent 3 technicians out who have all screwed up even more! The agents I speak to on the phone don't care, they won't even credit me the days I had no service. And the kicker is they allow me to cancel because they changed my contract when they signed me up for services so I'm obligated with Xfinity home for 2 years or I have to pay a $900 cancellation fee! I was not notified that they changed my contract. Had I known that I would have never added services! My bill is over $200 when it was only supposed to be $130 per month! I am extremely upset.
__label__1 Ever since my husband and I purchased our house, Comcast has been bothering us to find out why we disconnected our service. We keep telling them the old lady who used to own the house died and her kids canceled the account before they put the house up for sale. We have never had Comcast. Now, we get a salesman at our front door every few weeks (same guy) and he's so pushy and argumentative. Today, he tells me that I don't know what I'm talking about with my current service (DirecTV) and that I'm thinking of something else. I told him last time we asked to never be visited again by a salesperson and he said the message never got to him. But he was the one my husband told about! I want to ream that company out, but they make it impossible to contact them except to sign up. My husband and I are very technical and we know exactly what we're paying for. He's never going to swindle us into something by telling us our internet will be fast or that we want TV channels we don't watch. We did our research before we chose a service provider. Each time they come to our door, they are pretty much ensuring a little bit more than last time that I will never ever buy their products.
__label__1 I called to set up new service to the above address. We are moving in from out of state. I give the lady I talked to all the info she needed. She runs my credit check and tells me I have a $50 deposit. After I pay it, she takes the $50 out of my account. She says, Oh, we don't offer service at that address. They did not give me a refund and told me to call my bank and dispute the charge. This is not right, they stole my money.
__label__1 There is no customer support. I tried for several days to get an error on my bill resolved. I was transferred several times, and nobody solved my problem. I finally complained on a social site, and some Comcast executive contacted me and eventually fixed my billing error. I spent 20 years developing World Class customer service, and this company completely fails in all aspects. The more you spend, the worse the service. More in infomercials, commercials, buying programs. Seriously? I finally quit the TV, and use broadcast TV. Yes I still get all of the commercials etc, but at least I am not paying for them. The internet is supposedly the fastest, but still cuts out, especially during streaming movies from Netflix, and the audio is sometimes horrendous. The installer had to replace the equipment twice, because it was faulty. Nobody should have to pay hundreds of dollars for internet and/or TV.
__label__1 I have been a customer of Comcast for many years now. My home service is very erratic and despite several complaints, the issue has not been resolved. The trouble began on or before 12/16/2014 and has not been resolved yet. A Comcast technician visited on 12/22/2014 and saw the Orange cable that connects the Comcast Box near my home with another join from another Comcast Box 2 homes away - the Orange connector wire has been on the Road, in the rain and cold, and is stepped upon by people who walk that way, and is driven over by vehicles. I have been making complaints on the phone again and again, but to no avail. Since 12/16/2014, every time I have called, the automated system informs me that an outage has been reported in my area and that technicians are working hard to fix it, and that it will be fixed by N:NN AM/PM - the time indicated the fix will be complete comes and goes, and when I call back again, the fix time is now shifted upwards, to a deadline a couple of hours from the earlier deadline that passed by. My service has been very very erratic and I am extremely frustrated and mad, as I am stuck with Comcast for lack of a comparable alternative. I upgraded my service to 50Mbps and then to 105Mbps, but every time I am on a conference call and the caller on the other side does a screen share, my Skype connection is dropped immediately due to poor internet connectivity. I am very dissatisfied with Comcast's (non) handling of the issue and am unable to work. Please help me!!!!! I had complained about this last week as well, and an appointment was scheduled for Saturday (01/10/2015) and when the Comcast technician failed to show up, I called, and was told that the appointment was cancelled because there is an ongoing outage in my area. I had put aside all my chores for Saturday waiting for the technician to show up, and not only does the technician not show up, Comcast does not even bother to call me to inform me that the appointment is cancelled. I am at my wits end now, and cannot understand the apathy of a business towards its customer. I have been told that there is an underground cable breakage to the box that supplied internet to my home (to overcome the issue "temporarily", the orange cable has been connected between the two boxes), and that a work order should be in progress to fix the issue - THERE HAS BEEN NOBODY WHO CAME TO FIX THE ISSUE OF THE BROKEN UNDERGROUND CABLE TILL DATE (01/11/2015). Please ensure that this message reaches up the chain and is resolved ASAP.
__label__0 We were convinced by a sales rep from Comcast to upgrade our Comcast TV service to their DVR services. The unit is most probably defective because: We have to keep calling in to reset our service since we get blank screens It does not record a scheduled program from the beginning though we are setting the recording up properly. The online program directory has disappeared from our service, so we are not able to see a program schedule, though this is supposed to be included in our service.We scheduled a repair and the technician was to show up between 2pm and 5pm to repair or replace our unit. We confirmed by phone when they called using an automated system that indeed we still needed service. We were here all day waiting for the technician to call and by 2:45pm, since they had not called to tell us they were coming over, we called Comcast.They said our service call had been cancelled, and could give us no explanation why! Our only alternative was to reschedule at their earliest convenience, which is 3 days from now. Of course, we scheduled a service call from 2pm to 5pm again, but have no real faith that they will show up or even call without cancelling us for any reason again.
__label__0 Comcast Internet high-speed is not high-speed at all.  It is slow and getting slower. I am paying for high-speed Internet, and not getting this service.
__label__1 I have had a Comcast account for a year. I have standard cable, as well as internet service. In a year, my bill has gone from $100 a month to $129.14 a month to $164.47 a month. I have not added any channels or any services. Why does this cable company continue to operate which such impunity, while consumers are not given any options?
__label__1 I signed up for internet and was told I would be able to use wifi until my modem arrived. My wifi wasn't working and then when I called back they told me that I was signed up for the wrong plan and that my original plan was no longer available, did I want to continue service for another $20 a month... So I canceled.
__label__5 Comcast installed my service on DIRECTV's wiring, resulting in poor service. A tech came out and decided we definitely needed the correct wiring and I would not be charged since Comcast failed to wire my home from the start. I received a bill for $500 for wiring. For 4 months I spoke to 13 people, including a visit to the local Comcast office. All customer service reps and billing dept reps assured me on every call that the bill would be fixed while my service was constantly be suspended. Yes, they never fixed the bill or refrained from suspending my service every few days so now I'm done with them. I'm a new, happy customer of AT&T, with great service and customer service. Comcast has the worst customer service I've ever experienced.
__label__0 But on March 23, 2007 I received a call from a technician saying that instead of coming March 27th, he was free that day and asked if it would be alright if he came then instead. I agreed and the Comcast technician came to install the box. Now, I am a very inquisitive person and asked him why I had to have a box. I told him that I understood that as long as there was cable, one did not need the converter box. He told me it was not a converter box but a different kind of box that would give me many channels. I then asked him how long I would have to have the box and when would they come to remove it and he was evasive. He said, "They'll call you." When he finished installing the box, he told me to sign that I had received the box and I, in my naivet, signed the form. He did not leave me a copy and he left in a hurry.  I was delighted to have so many channels and asked my neighbors if they had also gotten a box, but none had.  A month went by and then one day I went online to see my credit card statement and print it as I do each month. When I noticed there was a charge for $63.14 from Comcast, instead of the normal fee of $12.56 that I have always paid. (I only purchase the Basic Service.) I called Comcast to question the charge and I was told that I had purchased a new service from a door-to-door Comcast salesperson. I denied this and explained above what I have told you and I was told that I had signed for the service and that they would not remove the charge. (Of course!! That was the form I signed for the technician, thinking I was only signing that the box had been delivered and installed!) I told them I did not order the service and asked they come and remove the box and put my service back the way it was before: to the basic service for $12.56.  After that, I attempted several times to speak to different Comcast customer service reps and none of them wanted to hear what I was saying.  Finally, one day last week I called again and spoke to customer service rep, Reyna, who was very nice, heard me out and said she was sorry for what I was put through. She asked me if I wanted her to tell her Supervisor that I wanted this to be investigated and I said yes.  So I assume it is being investigated. It should be by checking what date the box was installed in my home and the name of the individual who did it. Your records will show who it was.I have figured out what happened. Probably someone in your Company who will either get a commission for selling door-to-door (or must meet a quota) dreamed up the scam of having his girlfriend call the Comcast customers and give them the story I was given and the appointment set up in order not to have to come selling door-to-door. Once the appointment is made, it's a piece of cake, he comes in, installs the box to the unsuspecting customer, makes them sign that they received the box (when they are actually signing a new service order) and makes his commission (or adds to his quota) with no hassles. Comcast is unaware of these unscrupulous people they have hired. The name of the technician who came to my house, when I asked him his name, said his name was Shane or Sean. He is a tall, black fellow. This scam perpetrated against me has caused me anger, indignation and sleepless nights because I feel violated and will write to the City of Plantation and NBC about this.

__label__1 Comcast sent out a letter to notify me of a new modem upgrade. We ordered it to be mailed out at the end of Nov. We never received it and then received an automated message the end of Dec saying "call to order your new modem." Never once did they say we would lose our service, yet since mid-January we very rarely have any service at all. Now the company tells me they will send someone out to install the new modem and update my boxes for $100. Otherwise the company will mail it out for me. I was next transferred to the person who would set me up to receive the modem by mail when she tells me I have to pay $15 for them to mail me out a new modem which they mandate I get. The letter, call and the person I spoke to just before Marcela said it was free to mail it to me and I install it. So, Comcast would like to charge me for doing their job of installing and exchanging their outdated equipment and I should pay for the 6 to 10 days that I do not have service. Yep, that is the way Comcast does business.
__label__1 Comcast provides me with its "Triple Play" package (phone, internet and cable service). Phone calls occasionally go dead, computer service is interrupted and cable reception lately "freezes" with a need to load the Comcast transmission of the NetFlix "House of Cards." Several technical service people have been sent--each has been professional, helpful and made fixes that have temporarily lasted. However, each service person disagrees with and/or changed what his predecessors did. Consequences: Service problems continued and unreasonable amounts of my time are needed to reach Comcast. The latest example is that Comcast replaced its Xfinity router with a newer model, suggesting the previous model may have been the cause.
__label__1 They jacked up rates without informing us. Then reaching a live agent was nearly impossible, as the prompts kept guiding us to upgrade our service or add new services.
__label__1 Comcast charges for the cable that connects the box to the TV if a replacement is needed. Comcast charges for an HD box. TWC does not. HD is the standard.
__label__5 Ok. I contacted Comcast back in February 2014 of this year about why my bill went up. They told me because the promotion had ended. I asked if there were any new promotions. They said yes, it was scheduled and my new equipment and package was still suppose to be the same price which was $159.99, per month. (Keep in mind it was suppose to be for 24 months) That was in effort starting March 2014 only. On my next 2 bills my monthly went up to $199.99 per month. I have spent almost a whole day in total trying to get answers from Comcast. I spoke to at least 4 people, nothing. I even went to the local office yesterday, in Pleasantville, NJ, and waited. The rep said she was waiting for a supervisor, she saw as well the promo when it ended. She came out about 10 minutes later and said the supervisor said to call the 1-800#. I said I did several times and nothing and no one can answer my questions. I have attached 3 monthly invoices.
__label__1 Comcast complaint. This is the WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER! I contacted Comcast because I was moving on 7/31 and I was able to schedule an appointment to regain service on my closing date 8/14. Unfortunately I closed late in the evening so I had to reschedule my appointment. My appointment was rescheduled on 8/21 from 1-3 pm. I usually receive a call the day before to confirm. I did not receive one. On 8/21 I took a half day off work to be home by 1 pm. At 1:30, I called to confirm that your driver was still coming and the representative assured me they were. At 3 pm I called back to find out my appointment was canceled. I was very upset, that I rushed home to receive a service that never was provided and I called your contact center to speak to a supervisor and your outsourced representative refused to get one. Instead, she transferred me to the sales desk, after holding for a half an hour, who had no idea what was going on.After I explained how disappointed I was, he was able to get me another appointment for 8/25 between 9-11. Therefore, I took a half day off work in order to be present for the delivery. At approximately 9:15 am Comcast truck pulls up in front of my open door and proceeds to sit in the car. All of a sudden he turns the car back on and proceeds to drive away, that's when I come outside to yell for the car that never stopped. After waiting for the automated system to get me to a natural person, I was informed that the driver was already at the next job and that he called two numbers, one of which was a canceled Comcast serviced number and the other NEVER received a call, meanwhile the door was wide open and they preceded to tell me that he could not come back until 12-4. This means I would have to take the second half of the day off work.I asked to speak to a supervisor, because you can imagine my frustration with being requested to miss work while the people that are at their jobs keep asking me to miss more work because they can't fulfill their responsibilities. I asked if they can get a driver out during the time that was allotted, and if not, would I be compensated for the additional hours of work I would be missing and if not, I would like to cancel the service as well as two other policies that I am an authorized user on. She told me to call back after 11, if they did not come, in order to cancel because they were only willing to give me $20. I called back at 12 and each time I requested a supervisor and no one would put one on the phone.What type of company is this? You have no supervisors? No managers or accountability for your lack of competence? I was told eventually after an hour that they would come out from 12-4 and a supervisor would call me back. I received a call from a supervisor who confirmed I would be compensated for the ridiculous customer service I received up to this point but understood that my main concern at the moment was to receive service which I took off of work to receive. She was supposed to call me back. So imagine my surprise when I get a call back around approximately 1 pm to find that no one will be coming at all today. After visiting the nurse twice due to my blood pressure going up by the disappointment and lack of respect for my time, I told her to cancel the service.I later get a call back from Kevin, the guy that made the Tuesday appointment and he's expecting someone to come out. Which is the funniest thing that no one at your company has no idea of what's going on and I expect you all to communicate with me and your not even communicating with each other. All of this lead me to having 1% battery left speaking with your company and getting absolutely nowhere. So Kevin says he will call back if he can get someone out today. I never receive a call back. Yet, I'm still here trying to receive service from your company, solely due to the fact that I used all of my remaining PTO dealing with you and coming up with a package that's best for my family.I am supposed to receive cable, phone, Internet and security and your employees don't give a ** instead of shopping around and delaying the process further. This is my final attempt to receive Comcast services. However, I do expect to be compensated for the strain that you all have put on me physically, mentally and financially. In the meantime, I have no choice but to see what company actually wants to work and provide service that I'm paying for. In addition, I can't get my security until service is installed so In the meantime, my property and my family is at risk. #**comcast. Very Disappointed and Disgusted Customer.
__label__0 On February 9, 2010 about 2:30 pm, technician for Comcast came to my home to install new internet service but he changed some of my software and added new software I did not need or want without my knowledge, plus the software he added, my computer is not performing as it was.
__label__1 Called and ordered the new DVR box and they were very nice, said they would send it in 3 to 5 days. Never arrived. So I called again and they said they would send it priority mail, but I had to be there to sign for it. Guess what, I waited all day on a vacation day and it never came. Called them again and they said they did not send it. They then suggested that I go to the Comcast store and get it myself. This store is at least 45 min away. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told that they were all in a meeting and that I should believe that. They have to be the worst service company in the US.
__label__1 My bill gets higher by the second I get my bill that should be around 70$ but comes out to be over 100$. My first bill was crazy. The second one has all these new changes that I didn't ask so my bill is higher than the first one. I need my internet services but don't want to be stuck paying for something that I did not ask for.
__label__0 I ordered the new digital TV boxes. They came and I tried to connect the 5 TV. Nothing happened. I called and made an appointment for Sunday October 3rd 8-12. No one came or called. When I called, Salt Lake-- Mason and Robert said the service call was disconnected. No one called me. When I call Comcast the electronic answering says you have an appointment. I called again and now have an appointment for Monday, October 4th at 4-6 PM. I wasted 4 hours today waiting for the repair man.
__label__1 I upgraded my service from the starter to preferred. Quick and easy process! I received all channels on the main box but not the secondary/DTA box. The 1st representative scheduled the technician to come out. I requested a service discount during the call. He said he would leave a note on my account and told me to call back after the technician visits for the discount. A helpful technician comes out. I call Comcast back. I was told by the 2nd representative that I needed to upgrade the box to receive all channels. Extra charge... of course. I was upset that I was not told this necessary information during the upgrading process. I asked the rep to read the note on my account. There was no note about the service discount. I asked for the Customer Solutions dept. She said she was not going to transfer me if there was not an issue. I trusted the 1st Comcast rep however, he lied to me. The 2nd rep showed no empathy. Neither Comcast representatives treated me, the customer, as a priority. Very dissatisfied!
__label__1 Okay so my husband and I moved to our new residence on 10/1/16. Our appointment to set up cable and internet was FIRST scheduled for 10/6/16 from 3-5 P.M. That one was canceled due to hurricane Matthew who was expected to hit on 10/7/16. Fine, I understand that, no big deal. So they re-scheduled for 10/13/16 from 8-10 A.M. I thought that was a little too long but still was okay with it. The day before my appointment, on the 12th, I received BOTH an e-mail and voicemail confirmation confirming that my appointment was still set for the 13th at 8-10. Please someone tell me why it's 9:55 A.M. on 10/13/16 and no one is at my house, no one has called me, nothing. I called Comcast and before I even get to a human being the automated message says "I see you have an appointment scheduled for 10/19/16." Excuse me?? That's not what the e-mail or the voicemail I just received the day prior stated. So I get an agent on the phone, he tells me that someone should be able to still come out today, and I would receive a call within 30 minutes to set up a time. Fine, great. Well guess what, no one calls me within 30 minutes. I even give them an hour, and no call. So I call them a second time. This time I get someone I can barely understand and he says "Oh well I'm so sorry but it looks like the earliest possible appointment would be Wednesday, the 19th." Well that's unacceptable. My home should have been made a priority after my ORIGINAL appointment (10/6/16) was canceled. But of course it wasn't. I hang up on him because we are getting nowhere and I was losing patience due to the language barrier, so I call back a third time. Thankfully I get an American this time and I tell her all that has happened up until this point. She puts me on hold a few different times, attributing it to her computer being really slow. Whatever. So she tells me that she put my home in the system as a "priority" (why wasn't this done in the first place??) and that the earliest time available was 10/17/16 from 10-12 A.M. That still isn't good enough for me, but at this point I am physically and mentally drained that I just accept the time and hang up. To say that I have been horrendously inconvenienced is an understatement. I took time off of work and was sitting around my house for no reason, as I was unaware they changed my appointment time for no reason. And then, the kicker, I call the billing department and tell them that I expect my account to be credited the $20.00 that Comcast promises if a technician is late to an appointment. Well, the guy, Justine, tells me that since the appointment was re-scheduled, that normally wouldn't apply for the credit but that he would do it for me anyway. Gee, thanks for doing me such a huge favor. Give me a break. I am extremely dissatisfied and I don't even have my service yet!! I've tried uploading the e-mail sent on the 12th confirming my appointment for the 13th, but it won't let me.
__label__1 Off to Target to buy a router/modem for my XFINITY service. Just in case anyone else was a gullible as I have been I want to let you know. When I signed up for XFINITY I asked if I could buy my own modem rather than "rent" theirs. I was told by their representative no I could not. That only theirs would work, no other kind was compatible. I am not the most techno knowledgeable person out there so I believed him. I have bought and paid for that damn thing multiple times over the years and I am pissed. When a friend was telling me about how they got a new modem at Target I was baffled. "You can do that?" So I am going to go get one, bring it home and make sure I can make it work. And then I am off to Comcast Cable to give them their damn modem and a piece of my mind (a small one, I don't have much to spare right now.) I feel bad for whoever gets me. I know it's not their personal fault but unfortunately they are going to have to hear about it. What a dirt bag lying piece of ** I dealt with. No idea who it was, I bet they don't work there anymore. So if you were lied to too, get your own modem, save money and tell them what they can do with it. Have a nice day.
__label__1 For months, Comcast kept sending me "notices" that my modem was obsolete and needed to be replaced. So, I would ask for a technician, who NEVER showed up on three separate occasions. When the land line went totally dead, I called Comcast and someone stated that it wasn't the modem, and that I needed to purchase a new phone. So, I purchase a new phone, and the line is still dead.After 50,000 emails and angry phone calls, they finally resolve to send a technician. HE DID NOT SHOW UP. Finally, an employee who didn't have mental issues or a brain destroyed by weed contacted me and sent over a very competent and professional technician. This issue could have been resolved in less than 20 minutes and it took 48 hours worth of shouting and escalated blood pressure. Shortly thereafter, they disconnected the new modem again out of spite. I resolved not to pay anything until that land line was restored, so I guess someone must have put the pacifier down and turned the modem back on.My neighborhood and my apartment complex has no other option for service. This mega corporation, filled with employees who articulate in a drug induced manner, should be shut down, or taken over by genuine people instead of genuine cockroaches. They are a thorn in the side of consumers. If you have any other options, please DO NOT use Comcast. They are evil, satanic, despicable and most of all, stupid and incompetent.
__label__0 A sales rep. came to my door, gave me information and then asked if he could come in, and I said no. I took the information and said I would look into it and if interested I would call. He then came back to my home a few days later at 8:00 pm, then again on Saturday around 1:00 pm. I did not answer the door on either occasion.Again this Saturday, 9-25-2010, around 1:00 in the afternoon, I was in my garage and my neighbors came over and this Comcast rep pulls in my drive way and when he saw me and my neighbors, he pulled out of my drive way. I told my neighbors who he was and they stated that he has been at my home several times when I wasn't home. I went in the house and called Comcast to file a complaint. I had to call 3 times and was put on hold from 25 to 40 minutes each time and then finally the said they would have a supervisor call me before 5:00 pm. They took all the information regarding the complaint and my address. I heard them typing this call took about 20 minutes. No one called me.I called again on Monday, 9-27-2010. I couldn't get a supervisor, called again today, 9-28-2010, and told them if a supervisor did not get on the line now, I would contact the newspaper, TV and my attorney regarding this serious matter. I finally spoke with a Salvadore and he said that he would take all the info and pass it along to his boss and they will start an investigation, he gave me a case ticket number. I don't believe this because he said there was nothing in the system regarding me ever calling on Saturday. This company to me is really something and doesn't care about the people out there, especially when they are single women like myself who is being stalked by one of their employees.
__label__1 I had been a satisfied customer with Adelphia and later Comcast for well over 32 years. After their decision to outsource technical services and establish a complaint deterrent automated system, the level of incompetence and total disregard for customers has been a nightmare for over five years. I am a retired divorcee who survives on a restricted income and I faithfully pay Comcast $143.20 each month before the due date. In December 2010, I purchased a bundled service package with Comcast that included cable, internet, and telephone services. The contractual installer who installed the Internet and telephone equipment admitted that he was a novice which was quite evident by the length of time it took him to affix an inferior and primitive cable wiring display throughout hallway walls and floor. In retrospect, I also have ADT security services and whenever the telephone is disabled, my security services are also disabled. Since June 17, 2011, I intermittently had no telephone and Internet services for extended periods which ranged from 2 to 24 hours. Initially, I felt these problems were related to some strange power surge and was reluctant to complain. However, after experiencing 2 to 24 hour disruptions between July 11, 2011 and July 18, 2011, I requested a service call. After being placed on hold for 20 minutes, they finally dispatched a technician who arrived at 2:10PM and adjusted the wire outside and replaced the Comcast modem. He was unable to ascertain the source of the problem and left at 5:45PM. At 6:10PM, the internet and phone were off again. I have placed nine service calls, spoken with numerous supervisors, written to the CEO and the issues have not been resolved as of July 19, 2011. Thus, I am seeking restitution of fees paid for services that were not rendered. After reviewing the numerous complaints from almost every state, it is obvious that this company needs closer scrutiny and oversight. 97% of the 132 complaints received between October 16, 2010 and July 14, 2011 were related to billing practices and disruptions which are not regarding unpaid accounts.

__label__1 From set up to take away they have been nothing but a headache. They lied about the pricing. My bill went from a promotional price of 50 and some change to 184.00 and some change. Now they're harassing me daily for equipment that was already returned. Beside the point the equipment was delivered after the service was removed. And they won't stop sending me bills even though I was protected under the 30 day guarantee that if you're not satisfied you don't pay. I confirmed on 3 different day with 3 different adviser that my account was cancelled and they're still sending bills that are higher and higher. I'm so scared they will tarnish my excellent credit. I just got off the phone with a service adviser about the most current bill for 321.34. He advised me after I've already gotten 3 confirmations that I'm protected underneath the 30 days guarantee, that they will send me to a customer service adviser to have me credited. Wow really Comcast. They're stating I never cancelled. I beg to differ. Now I'm on hold waiting for them to clear up their mistake for the 4th time. 24 minutes and 36 seconds later I got another confirmation number from Chris stating my balance is now 0 dollars. I hope this confirmation number and this adviser Chris is being truthful for I've had enough. I will never do business with comcast again. I feel comcast needs to be revamped. I smell a class action suit real soon.
__label__0 The Customer Service Representative at Comcast intentionally told me misleading information two days in a row.  They also allowed me and my family to live in a house with no phone services for two days and my house could have burned down or my children could get sick and die by the time I'll get somewhere to call for help.  I lost a total of two days that I was waiting on a technician that was not on the way and when the technician came and hooked up my internet, he took my 36 dollar card that I purchased on my own.When I called to add the internet that the CSR told me that all I needed to do was get the card and I will have the internet and that was untrue and a waste of money because after it was opened, it couldn't be returned.
__label__1 My experience with Comcast has been horrible. They are deceitful and predatory. They lie and just want to find ways to trap their customers and take their money. My latest episode started when I went to take my ex wife's name off the account. I was told I had to open an entirely new account and start a new two year contract or pay a $1,100 early termination fee. I was already on the old account, I just wanted to take my ex wife's name off. I was also told I had to schedule an installation, which would cost me $100. What are they installing? I am keeping everything the same, just changing the name on the account. I scheduled the installation twice and they missed both appointments. Then they shut off my service, including my home phone without telling me. I have kids who get home from school before I get home from work. We depend on them being able to use the phone. I complained and scheduled a new appointment and they agreed to waive the fee. But of course in the end they charged me, but bumped it up to $130. I can't wait for my contract to be up so that I never have to do business with them again.
__label__1 We were told we would have to have boxes in order for our TV to work even though they are new flat screens. When you hook them up to regular cable, it is snow, so then they tried the adapters and they would not work. It is funny, the only thing that seemed to work are the boxes that are $9.99 a month. I called to see what I can do about getting them cheaper and they said not a thing. So now I am waiting on a supervisor to call and on top of that, they gave us a new account number since the main account holder passed away and we did not have phone service for over a week. It took them forever to fix it since the phone number was in space, they said. They also asked if we could bring the guy who passed away down and we said OK, we will bring the ashes. What idiot person would ask that? Comcast is a bunch of crap.
__label__1 Bad, bad, bad. I don't know what else to say. It's bad enough we (Comcast customers) have to fight every year to make sure our provider is offering us a fair deal but to deal with bait and switch every time you renew is not only dishonest, it should be illegal. I'll make a long story (we all know how long it takes to get a Comcast CS rep to respond to a customer) as short as possible. This is now the 2nd year in a row where a Comcast CS rep took the time to quote me a package that fit my budget. They spent at least 5 min (I know this from the chat window time stamp) to quote me a package. When I said yes, they came back and told me it wasn't available and quoted me a higher price. They refused to honor their quote, very frustrating. In most cases, I would have let this go, but they took the time to quote me, answer questions specific to the package and confirmed the package before they went to activate. So they knew what they had available. And we all know, they are sitting in front of a terminal that tells them what to offer. That said, they (rep and supervisor) refused to honor their quote. The difference was only $10/month over 24 mths. You might ask, why fight it then? It was the principle of it. They should honor what the quote, especially for loyal, long-term customers. Instead, they simple said there was nothing they could do. I ended up signing up for the deal. I am stuck in a 24-month contract with a $230 penalty if I end it early (read the fine print everyone) and I am very disappointed. This is a classic bait and switch. I plan to report them to BBB and the FCC. Good luck to all, as consumers, our choices are becoming very limited and Comcast knows it.
__label__1 Let me start with I had Comcast years ago. Even then customer service and service in general was a horrible experience. I was on the phone with them at least once per month. Let's just say, my time with them was short. I currently have internet with Comcast as DirecTV doesn't supply internet. My cable service is getting rather expensive so I thought I would give Comcast another try. Wow was I wrong. I placed three different orders online at different times and each time was an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. The first time, the tech never showed up. No phone call or anything. I cancelled my request. The second time, I placed an order online and selected a desired date. I received an email stating my order is not finalized and to call customer service. I did and rep tells me that date isn't available. I cancel again since no other dates were available. The last time, once again I placed an order online, received an email and called customer service. Apparently, the prices listed online isn't available in all areas. Yet when I log onto my account, a screen pops up asking to upgrade. Now correct me if I'm wrong but if I have a profile, it automatically reads my location. So why can I not get the package I ordered. So the idiot rep tells me only two packages are available and I can't get anything else. After arguing for about 20 minutes, I told her to forget the whole thing and I'll wait for FiOS to be installed in my area. Please stay away from Comcast. They sucked then, they suck now and nothing will change.
__label__1 Called Comcast a month ago to complain about price. Was given free HBO. Called on 08/15/15 because billed 10.00. While in the call dvr and TV was shut off. While waiting for a solution, agent mentioned a second dvr, told her I did not have another TV. Agent added dvr box without my permission. Called at 8:00 am on Sat 08/16/2015, asked for supervisor to contact me, never did. Called from 8 until noon, agents said they would not take off 2nd dvr until I returned dvr that I did not have. Went down to the physical store, spoke to the supervisor Carlos in Naples who said problem was fixed... no apologies. Got home... my DVR is not working!!! Worst company ever!
__label__1 My Comcast "nightmare" began January 16, 2015, when I signed up for new service. **, salesman with Comcast at 5720 Asheville Hwy, Knoxville, TN 37924, explained a two-year plan but later I discovered he signed me up on a six-month plan? He quoted me a price of $125.64 a month. I have called him six times and left message on his CELL PHONE (his office does not take INCOMING phone calls?). It took three scheduled service calls to finally get an installer out. I spoke with ** in Stone Mountain, Georgia three times when they tried to change the third date to a FOURTH date. I demanded they keep the third date. The first installer who arrived was in a big hurry. (He was very inexperience. He was more concerned with a "pigeon" he had in a box in his truck). He moved two of three phones to the opposite side of the room, one on a very short cord, which I spent almost an hour re-wiring the next day. The third phone was in my kitchen, he said he COULD NOT connect it, although it had worked OK for years. He also installed the WRONG cord on one of my TV's, which created a "snowy" picture for the next three days until the second installer came out. Three days later the second installer arrived. He spent less than one hour correcting 9 of 10 problem left by the first installer. He re-wired the two phones and wired the third phone in minutes and said the first installer just didn't want to take the time? He also replaced the wrong cable on the TV which corrected the "snow" problem. During that day, THREE Comcast trucks showed up, each about 2 hours apart. THEN THE BILLING PROBLEM BEGAN. I received an email stating the monthly bill was estimated to be $148.00 a month, then an email showing a previous balance of $235.38? Then an email showing a new balance of $351.34, including the old previous balance. I phoned and after spending several minutes on their AUTOMATED phone system, I spoke to ** (in INDIANA). She was the first person who seemed to know what she was doing. She explained the salesman had written up the wrong plan, which should not have charged an installation charge. She corrected the plan to a 24-month plan and removed the installation charge. She said my monthly bill would be $128.97 TOTAL including all taxes and charges. NOW I get a new email which shows the installation charges removed, BUT a new balance of $291.39 (not the 128.97 as promised). On 2/27/15 I began trying to call ** (YOU CANNOT TALK TO THE SAME PERSON TWICE). I phoned from noon to 6 PM, TWENTY ONE times with NO CONTACT. Each time, I went through their automated system (and had to listen to their COMMERCIALS); was told to stay on the line for a representative. Monday, March 2, I began calling at 10 AM. After talking to several people and leaving my phone #, I get a call from ** from the corporate office, who REFUSED to help, but would only QUOTE policy of a DOUBLE BILLING THE FIRST MONTH. I was never told of this, going back to Jan. 16. ** was a VERY ARROGANT person. She promised someone else would call me back---but, of course, no one has called!This service has been totally MISREPRESENTED. I spent yesterday filing a complaint with the FCC and the Better Business Bureau (I had seen on the internet, the only way to get results from Comcast is to file a report with the FCC). My balance should be $128.97 TOTAL for the first month and each month for 24 months, NOT two months the first month. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ALMOST 7 WEEKS.
__label__1 In general most companies who offer a service to the public struggles with providing world class customer service. My company is no different. There are many contributing factors that plays into companies not being able to obtain such lofty goals. Factors like the employee pool companies have to hire from. There is also poor management decisions making that don't always lead to providing the best customer service. However, after my recent experience with Comcast I find it hard to believe that there is another company out there who provides worst customer service as they do. Back in February I was forced to get Comcast service because my apartment complex switched their cable service to them. I signed up for their deal which meant I had to keep the service for a year. In March I move out of the complex. I called up Comcast and let them know I would be discontinuing their service because I was moving to a new location. I let them know that a different TV provider was already available at my new location therefore I would no longer be need them. I let them know there would be an early termination fee. I was given the termination fee amount plus what I owed on my final bill for the service I had. I paid the bill on March 27th and I turned my equipment in on March 28th. When I turned my equipment in, to my surprise, I was told I would receive a $71.00 refund. On April 8th I received a new billing statement from them. My bill was $32.62. I called them and ask for an explanation for the bill. At first, I tried the chat route, which was pointless because they don't have access to any notes that are placed on an account. I then called their billing department. I was told that I should have to pay the $32.62 because I moved to a location that already had TV service available. I was then transferred to their win back department to get my issue resolved. That agent was even more clueless than the first two agent I spoke with. She was very unrelenting in her position that I was not going to get a refund and I had to pay the $32.62 bill. Problem is at that point I didn't even want the refund anymore. I was more concerned about how I had been provided with misinformation by at least four different agents. I also wondered why there were never any notes on my account from the previous times I had called in. Again, the agent was not very apologetic at all. Her only comeback was that I was responsible for the $32.62. I have since paid the bill but because of the agent's lack of empathy and Comcast sense of disorganization (one department not know what the other department is doing) I will never use their service again even if I have to pay double for another service provider.
__label__1 Tried five time to activate 2 new units. Only 1 has worked since 5-15-2015. Had to go to Brentwood, CA office. Told **, fat black female with attitude about lack of 3rd unit working. Was asked irrelevant question about HDMI as 4 TV's don't have HDMI & other equipment converts 480/720 signals to 1080. 6 TV's receive HDMI over the air. ** said info needed to solve problem. Quest is irrelevant unless extra services to be sold to get commission. Was told problem of 3rd unit solved. At home and 3rd unit problem is NOT SOLVED as of 12:03, 3rd unit still blinking. Complaint to be filed with CA consumer Affairs and FCC.
__label__1 If anyone thinks that Comcast is not aware of what they are doing, they are deluding themselves. Utter genius to create a monopoly selling a product that does not work, in fact, gets progressively worse, then sell "upgrades" to improve service (which do not work either). This is exactly why net neutrality is so vital. These corporate criminals will not react to any of our consumer pleas so long as they can extort profits from us for peddling garbage, unchecked and unregulated.
__label__1 I had asked for a new installation and activation of their triple play (tv/internet/phone). This person had no clue, he started in attic because he said that the wires were coming down the walls. He obviously doesn't know that houses today come pre-wired. After about 3 hours he got the tv and internet going, but has now lost the phones. He said that he would go outside to see about the phones, instead he got in his van and took off. Comcast said that the best they could do was 2 weeks to come back out. It was then I ripped out the entire installation, and then found out that not only did he not complete the install, but had lied and said it was done and had scheduled a time for the lines to be buried. He also had broken the outside phone box lock and just left it wide open, so any rain, snow, etc could now get into it and cause more problems.
__label__1 On numerous occasions my wifi has been disabled causing me to contact the company, etc. It would not be a huge deal except that I pay numerous amounts in fees and charges for the service that never actually works. I know other people have issues with WIFI and I'm surprised Comcast has not had to make amends to their overcharges and unfair practices.
__label__1 I received a promotion from Xfinity for 69 $ a month then it went up to 99$. I assumed it was because I had 3 TVs. Then I get told is going to be 113 $ with alarm system so I thought we need it so we got it. At that point I thought it is less than AT&T then they tell me is 130 $. Now I am getting upset because my husband and I are on disability so I start downsizing and I removed the alarm system, get Vonage for my phone service. As I am doing that I am talking to several customers and they tell me is going to be more expensive without my phone line to keep it because is already in the package. I am going nuts here because I already have turn it to Vonage. To make the story short I get my third bill and is 237 $ for fees that they just added that make no sense. My bill is going to be 155$ a month and I even call corporate to solve this problem and I get the same treatment I received from two customer service and two supervisors. They were rude and wouldn't let me talk and worst they told me if I wanted to cancel to go ahead. They scam you. Once they have you, the bill starts cropping up on you and they don't care.
__label__0 I then received flyers from them for free connection in servicable areas. Sorry but that doesen't apply to you is the answer I got to those. I even offered to have the cable ran by a subcontracter they were still going to charge me $2800.00 just to turn on the service if I did that.I even called the corporate office who said I am a servicable area and I had the flyer for free conection but that still does not apply to me. I have been fighting with this company for almost a year now. The flyers that I received came in my name to my address. 
__label__1 Comcast offered a two-year contract at a one year rate of $89.99. After one year, price jumped to $109.99. I called customer no service and I was told the lower price was only good for a year. I have tried verbally disputing on the phone with agents whom I can barely understand. They sounded like robots repeating same info over and over. The salesman who made the deal with us in our family room is long gone. Horrible business ethics/service. Basically, they won't honor the original verbally agreed pricing. 
__label__5 Comcast TV, internet, home phone - I switched service from Century Link on 8/4/2011 to Comcast. I am continuing to be billed by Century Link. When I switched, Comcast stated they would take care of paperwork but neither will help with problem after being contacted several times. Both parties are wanting payment. I am paying Comcast for their service. I need help in resolving this problem.
__label__0       Over a month ago, I requested a bundling of my services (cable, home phone, & internet).  At the time of the request, I was told that my original telephone number could be "ported" from ATT.  The installation took place on 4/29/09.  I was told at the time of the installation that the porting would take place in 5 - 7 days.  After 7 days, I contacted Comcast to see the status.  I was told then that the request for "porting" the number had not been made.  I was directed to a 3rd party to verify that I wanted the number ported. I asked Comcast Customer Service, if I needed to contact AT & T to request the number to be ported.  I was told no.  Another 7 days passed & my phone number had not been ported.  I called Comcast again & was told that the request had not been made.  A second time, I was directed to a 3rd party to verify the porting.  Again, I asked if I needed to contact AT & T to request the number to be ported & was told no.  Another 7 days passed without the number being ported.  A third time I called to see why the number was not ported.  A customer service representative said that I had not requested the number to be ported.  A third time I requested the number to be ported & was directed to a 3rd party to verify.  This time, a representative told me that I did need to call AT & T to tell them to "let the number go".  I called AT & T and the representative said that the number was in the process of being ported & it was not necessary for me to request the port through them; that it should be done through a 3rd party.  
In the past month, I have made a dozen phone calls & 2 "live chats" with Comcast.  I have spent over 10 hours trying to resolve this issue.  Each representative that I spoke with were unable to rectify this situation.  On Monday, May 25, I was "promised" yet again that I would have my number ported in 24 hours.  In addition, I would have a credit of approximately $175 on my account due to the problems that I had encountered.  On 5/28, I checked my account on line & saw that the "credits" were actually additions to my bill & I still do not have the service that I was paying for. I have spent over 10 hours of my time dealing with what comcast has admitted as their mistake. I have also been billed $430.81 for service that I have not received. All without resolve to this issue.  Supervisors, whom the representatives insist are the only ones able to rectify this situation are unwilling to speak to me.  It appears that there is a pervasive attitude at Comcast of unwillingness to assist or to take responsiblity for the mistakes of their employees.  There is also a sense that the supervisors are "above" talking to customers.  For approxmiately 30 minutes I was on hold for a supervisor & was disconnected.   A third time I called to see why the number was not ported.  A customer service representative said that I had not requested the number to be ported.  A third time I requested the number to be ported & was directed to a 3rd party to verify.  This time, a representative told me that I did need to call AT & T to tell them to "let the number go".  I called AT & T and the representative said that the number was in the process of being ported & it was not necessary for me to request the port through them; that it should be done through a 3rd party.   On 5/28, I checked my account on line & saw that the "credits" were actually additions to my bill & I still do not have the service that I was paying for.

__label__0 I had cable internet reinstalled. I had my own new modem, a Motorola. Serial numbers: 06H7GVXDF355, 128103425705795102010000. HFC MAC ID: 0011AEC8D38A. Model number: SB5100. They installed their own modem without my knowledge and took my modem. I made at least a dozen phone calls regarding this matter and never got return phone calls except once which in turn they left a return phone number that was unreachable for incoming calls. They sent me via US Mail a modem that is a Motorola but not my original one. The one they sent was used and an older model. The modem that is missing is valued at $100 and I would like a check for $100 or a $100 credit to my bill.
__label__1 I had the Comcast installation crew in my home today for an initial service set up. When the installation techs left, the service was working fine. In 2 hours, the entire system went down. After more than an hour on the phone with customer service, no solution was provided, no option for support, no option for service other than wait another 3 days for a tech to be dispatched. Their service is completely detestable. Their response time is completely inadequate and the agents I spoke with had no concern to resolve the matter. I will be removing the entire system and contacting a dish provider. I have never had such a terrible experience with a cable or dish provider as my experience in 1 day with Comcast. The organization should be ashamed and admonished for creating such a smoke and mirror or presenting themselves as "exceptional customer service". The only exceptional service was the completely inadequate service followed by the option of returning their equipment. Consumers beware - - any service other than Comcast!
__label__0 I was using my wife computer and notice it seemed very slow I had the fellow that take cars of her computer come over and look it over he did a speed test on it and said the computer was ok but the comcast cable was twice as slow as dsl, he suggested to my wife to contact you guys which i know that she has not done so I am, he also said the trunk line is coming out of WA.
__label__0 I have called 6 times and been on hold for up to 30 minutes and they say you must leave a message then they hang up.  I need to speak with them when I have some technical support as I know nothing in addition business is really rough and I cannot shut down during our brief season or tie myself up or my phone lines.  I am so frustrated and of course this is the cable company and I have no recourse. Patriot Media has been our provider for years and we never had a problem and the service was excellent. How do I get them to cooperate, this is my business I need help. They have already shut down my VPN for half a day for them to update, during business hours, this little switch will cost $ 350.00 plus downtime for my business, there is no telling how much business I will lose due to their changeover.
__label__0 When calling Comcast local they tried to blame it on my browser.
__label__1 First off trying to use their automated phone system to try to talk to someone is just messed up. It hung up on me over 8 times before I could finally talk to someone. Then when you talk to someone they are real idiots as other reviews say. Then after talking to them I had to call someone else because they would not transfer me and that automated system is just as bad. Then I get another idiot that can't help me that I have to give them my information so someone can call me back in 12 to 24 hours. This whole process took over an hour just to find out someone will call me back in 12 to 24 hours. Really I am trying to get something tooken care of today not 24 HOURS FROM NOW. DO NOT GET SERVICE WITH THIS COMPANY.
__label__1 I am writing this review in hopes that I can help someone make a decision that could possible save them from an immense amount of unnecessary stress and inconvenience. I generally consider myself to be a patient and empathetic person. No one is perfect, and people are bound to make mistakes. With that being said, I'd like to share my experience with Comcast/XFINITY.I moved to Atlanta in October 2014. Upon getting settled into my cozy, downtown apartment, I contacted Comcast to set up cable and internet. I decided to move forward with a promotional package that included basic cable and internet for approximately $90. Initially, my first impression was that of satisfaction as the cable installer arrived on time, setup everything to standard, and was very charismatic and friendly. It is what happened afterwards that has left me very disappointed and beyond disgruntled.There was fine print in the promotional package I signed up for that the sales associate failed to inform me of. Apparently, this package was a two year contract in disguise. This is partially my fault for not asking all the right questions. However, the fulfillment of a contract that comes with a promotional package is something I should have been briefed on prior to my signature and payment information being supplied to billing. I learned of my undisclosed two year contract when I noticed XFINITY had charged my bank account $140. I, of course, called the customer support service to figure out why my monthly bill went from $90 to $140, and I was told that "the second year of the contract states that the monthly payment increases to $140."In August 2015 I moved to a different address. I called to have my service switched to my new residence, but this seemed to be an impossible task to accomplish. It took me almost four hours to get this done, and I called customer support six times before I reached someone who could properly assist me. Shortly thereafter, I received a letter in the mail stating that I had been receiving the wrong package my mistake, and that my HD channels would be removed. At this point, I was paying $140 per month for BASIC cable (fuzzy, horrible picture) and internet. I attempted to cancel my service, but I would have owed over $230 in cancellation fees. So, that was obviously not an option.Fast forward to September 2016. I am in the process of moving to a different state. It literally took me FOUR phone calls to cancel my service. Four. Let that sink in. That cannot be the standard. There is an obvious lack of training with the customer support employees. None of them are on the same page, and this was quite apparent after I was told something different about my cancellation request during all four phone calls. During my last phone call, I actually had the privilege of speaking to a young woman who possessed intelligence. She successfully processed my request to cancel my service, and after she spoke to someone in the billing department she and I both learned that I had no cancellation fee as I had fulfilled the requirements of my contract. My advice to anyone considering cable with Comcast/XFINITY: just Netflix and chill.
__label__1 Gotta wonder why they broke up AT&T in 1983. Comcast is a monopoly! Their customer service sucks. Just got off the phone for the 3rd time, found out they outsourced it to the Philippines. Their network engineer told me I had a line problem causing a slow and interrupted connection. I made an appt for 9/3/14, found out today the appt was never made. After 2 phone calls, I now have a new appt in 4 days on Sunday. At least now I don't have to take another day off, but 4 more days for lousy service. I have the Arris wifi modem. They came out to my home w/i the last year, so why am I having line issues?? Many times in a day, a search goes unanswered, email says request cancelled, it reminds me of dial up. I wish for competition and lower prices. I'm done with triple play, will lose the phone & tv at the end of contract. Can't wait. Can use pc for tv and antenna for local channels. Can you imagine free tv once again? Can get Netflix, Roku. Die Comcast die!!!!!!! You suck!!!!! Use USA for customer support center!!!! Get a clue. Die Comcast die!!!!!
__label__1 I have been trying to get my service converted to seasonal service since November 10, 2014 using the various Comcast customer service avenues that Comcast offers. All of the avenues have failed with promises to contact me after the conversion was completed broken. I have emailed, called, or chatted a total of a dozen times on this matter. I have never been so disrespected from any other customer service.Here is a short time-line of what I have done and the time I have spent on this issue:11/10/14 After a couple of dropped phone calls I talked to a customer service person who took my request and cheerfully said that it would show up in a couple of days but would be effective 11/10/14 so the current bill of 11/21 to 12/20 for $127.51 would be adjusted down to $10. A new bill would be issued. 11/20/14 After checking online and seeing that the bill had not been changed I sent in a $20 payment to hopefully make sure I was not charged as non payment for the seasonal costs.11/20/14 Called customer service, the rep told me that Comcast was having problems with getting people on seasonal and there was nothing she could do. 11/20/14 Called Customer Service again and talked to Lynn. She told me that she needed to put in a request to customer service to put my on seasonal made. She opened a ticket number **. She assured me that my account would be adjusted to 11/10 seasonal and rebilled accordingly. She would call me back to confirm that it was taken care of. (No call was ever received.)11/21 Contacted online chat. They said that nothing would work unless I called 1-888-633-4266. I called the number and just got the normal Comcast line. 11/24 Called customer service and talked to Dani Rep said they would handle it and back date it to 11/10 but it was going to be $12 per month instead of $10. Rep said they would call me to confirm. (No phone call back was ever received.)12/15 Called customer service and talked to Tobias. He told me that there was some error on my account and now that it showed that I was overdue on payment that I could not be placed on Seasonal until the bill was corrected. He said that they were have Tons of Problems like this and that he would make sure that he would shepherd this thru the system. He said he would call me that evening to let me know it was taken care of. Tobias did call me that evening and said that he was having problems with the Billing Dept. in correcting the billing but he would stay on top of it. He said he would call me when done. (No phone call.)Now I have a second bill that show I am past due on last month's bill less the twenty dollars received plus the full cost for 12/21 to 1/20/15. I just sent in another $20 for the current bill so in reality I should have a credit of around $16 versus and cost of $244.52.This nightmare continues.
__label__1 It's so frustrating to down $250/month to have trouble with service almost 90% of the time. I get anxiety just trying to change channels. Everything freezes and most of the time I get a "we are having trouble connecting to the server" message. Cant wait to switch to another company. Called customer service more than 3 times, get someone on the other end that is clearly reading from a script and has no idea what they're saying.
__label__1 I have had issues with Comcast in the past but unfortunately we had to have Comcast in our apartment complex. I decided to do the self-installation due to the hidden charges I have experienced in the past with installation. Self-install went fine except with two TVs. The third TV box wasn't working. I called and the tech told me that the box wasn't working so he would send me a new one. A week later when the box arrives, it doesn't work either. After spending 30 minutes on the phone, I am told that the outlets aren't activated. A technician would have to come out but it would be $39 to this service. Are you kidding me? To get the runaround and now to charge me again is ridiculous to me. I ask to speak to a supervisor only to be told "Sorry there is nothing that could be done." There was no manager that I could speak to as well. So congratulations to the supervisor as she must be the CEO of Comcast. Good for her! She didn't care how inconvenienced I was but if I wanted my son to have TV, I would have to pay the fee. To add salt to the wound, I have to wait a week for this technician. There was no apology - nothing. Thank goodness I didn't sign a contract with these people. My advice for their new customers is that Comcast will eventually get the original $79 out of you for a new installation. Don't waste your time and just pay the fee. I have never dealt with such an unethical company.
__label__1 I have called 6 times today to disconnect my internet services. Every time I called, they just transferred to a voicemail. They started calling me at 6 am on a Sunday morning for a past due balance after I set up an autopay to take care of it. They never charged me and continued to call me 5 times on Sunday morning starting at 6 am. The customer service rep told me they can call me whenever they want.
__label__1 I will start off saying that the customer service reps and even some of the corporate service reps need more training/coaching, this has been the WORST experience I've ever had with a cable company and I never want to deal with Comcast again. They misapplied $104 of my money and put it towards another account in my name that was already closed two years ago! In the beginning of this foolishness, reps told me they didn't know where the money was at and it was never applied to my account, which irritated me to no end on how you don't know where my money went. Then when I asked an agent in the store who was awesome where the money was, he quickly found it in an account that was closed. I called them back and was told I'd have to wait 10 days before someone would talk to me about this issue!Now I became irate and called Corporate and spoke to someone very kind and helpful who escalated the situation so I could get my refund. Here is the bs... A woman called me and said she was a supervisor from corporate office in Philly and she was going to help me (yeah right). So she was very snide and rude, she proceeded to tell me that she has to "investigate" and pull the conversation up where I told agents I wanted to cut my service. I told her to do what she has to do to return my money, now I have yet to hear back from this woman and I called back today!I was told today I had to POSSIBLY wait until November 2nd to hear back about my refund and it was a possibility that it would be given by check in the mail!!! Now I told them that I didn't pay that out by check and to refund my funds the way it was paid out. Why should I have to wait almost 10 days when it took less than 2 mins to take it out my account. I will NEVER recommend Comcast to anyone and I will never use them ever again!
__label__0 Comcast raised their prices again! I am disabled, and my husband is a senior citizen. We cannot afford these prices with our income! We could always give up some food! I hear their profits are up 53% the first quarter this year! They are vampires sucking the family life line out of today's financially stressed families. I asked the customer service person on the phone to send me a breakdown of the service charges and tier level charges but was told I had to "go pick it up" at an office. That is a great service for the elderly and crippled! Comcast is a self-feeding glutton!
__label__0 I have called Comcast for a week to take the cable out of my yard. I am not a customer and the cable is not connected to my home. It is attached to the neighbor's house. I have explained to them that we are trying to obtain a license for this property to move our family daycare. Each day I call, I hold on while they go somewhere. I wait and they come back to tell me they are coming out that day. Sometimes when I have held so long, I am disconnected. My granddaughter comes over and she cannot go and play in her backyard because of that cable.
__label__0 I recently moved and thought that Comcast had great specials and would proove to be a good cable company.  Boy was I wrong.  My service never worked!  I had a DVR that was replaced 4 times over a 4 month period and never worked.  I had to spend numerous hours on the phone with customer service to get no resolution or help.  When I had finally had enough I asked to speak to a supervisor I went strait to voicemail and left many many messages and to this day have never received a call in return.  I had them come and get their faulty equipment and refuse to do any buisness with them ever agian.  I work in Customer Service and I have never seen a company so Poorly managed.  I warn anyone looking into Comcast to stay far away.  They will take your money and give you nothing in return!  They use faulty equipment and have no concern for their customers. I will never make the mistake of using them ever agin.
__label__0 Comcast has completely bungled the conversion to digital service. The failed to adequately communicate to customers that ALL cable customers need to get digital conversion boxes and that they would provide two for free. Instead they led customers to believe that unless they had no cable service and were receiving signals over the air that they needed to do nothing. We became aware of the need to order their cable boxes when they started dropping channels from analog transmittal. We promptly ordered boxes which were delivered quickly but required customer installation and activation by phone. I have called their service center four times over the course of the last 5 days to try to get cable boxes activated. I spoke to a supervisor the last time to no avail. They all asked me exactly the same questions and put me through the same paces bouncing from one set to the next (at opposite ends of our home). I have now done exactly the same thing four times with the same result. No activation. After being put on hold for the third time, and for a total of 40 minutes I hung up and tried live chat. I quickly saw that that was going to get me nowhere so I ended the chat session. The tech. (Mario) stayed on to check on the health of the account and he informed me that we had a balance due. However, Comcast has been withdrawing money from our primary checking account on a monthly basis for years and we just paid the latest bill last week. I am absolutely flabbergasted that this company can have such poor service that it requires its customers to install its own equipment, then spend hour after hour on the phone trying to get the equipment to work. And then...their technicians insinuate that the problem is mine because I haven't paid my bill. Unmitigated gall and arrogance. Absolutely unbelievable. I sincerely hope that this company fails due to lack of customer service. 
__label__0    for over 3 weeks my internet service has been down for the majority of the day , in the middle of the night it usually comes up, first i try to schedule an appt and they refuse because there are problems in the area and tell me to keep calling back because they will not schedule a service appt if there are problems in the area after several calls I insist on speaking to a manager to schedule an appt. they do then cancel it automatically because there were problems in the area that were resolved they did leave me an automatied phone message stating to call back if my problems still exists. I call back demanding the still send out the service person between the hours of 4-7 pm as promised twice they tell me they are contacting the dispatch office and someone will call me back in 5-10 minutes and they will issue me a credit they did not call nor was I issued a credit, the third phone call the man tells me they do not work after 5 and I would have to reschedule, I do for Tuesday 4-7pm, Monday I call to check to make sure there is no problems and the recording tells me I am scheduled for that day between 1-4 while I am sitting in my office some how my appt for the following day was cancelled on Saturday and rescheduled for Monday they tried to say I did it, We were not home over the week end. Reschedule for yesterday, keep calling to verify the appt has not been cancelled and the recording states a repair man will be out to my home between 4-7pm   6:30 no call no service man I call customer service to be told they tried to call my house at 2pm and 3:10 since no one answered they cancelled my service. call again. I told them I was home sitting by the phone from 3:25 on.  I request to speak to a supervisor who changes the story to include a phone call at 4:09. promises me an email to verify the following a 25.00 credit 19.96 per month for internet service for 6 months and a repair person to day 4-7pm. so far no email and I have been calling their 800 number every hour to make sure they haven't cancelled. they have the worse customer service I have ever dealt with thanks to their monopoly on cable what choice do we have  I request to speak to a supervisor who changes the story to include a phone call at 4:09. promises me an email to verify the following a 25.00 credit 19.96 per month for internet service for 6 months and a repair person to day 4-7pm. so far no email and I have been calling their 800 number every hour to make sure they haven't cancelled. they have the worse customer service I have ever dealt with thanks to their monopoly on cable what choice do we have 
__label__0 Comcast is dishonest! Within a couple of weeks after my triple-play "promotional rate" of $141 ended, I called them to see if there were any other promotions I could get on. I was told there were by a rep from their "Customer Retention" division. He told me he would put me on a $122 (and change) rate, and it would be effective as of the end of my promotional rate.I also got a letter from Comcast, 2 days after that call saying that "as a valued customer", I would be getting at $10 triple-play credit for as long as I maintained my current level of service, and a $25 "valued customer" credit on every bill for the next 12 months. Turns out the total $35 credit reduced the "regular" charges to, guess what--$122! I thought I was getting a "deal", but it was no deal because I was just getting the reduced bill for being a "valued customer".But when the bill came, it was for $157. Called Comcast and was told that I was not on any new promotional rate. IOW, the rep lied or was incompetent and did not put me on the new rate. I mentioned the letter I had gotten from Comcast, and guess what the rep said? "That letter was sent to you in error!" At that point, I exploded, which I rarely do on the phone. After that, she said (again) that I was switched to the new promotional rate. But when I accessed my bill online, it was still just short of $157.Talked to another rep and was told that my new bill was $113.28. I asked if that's true, why does it still show $156 and change when I access it? She said the credit would show on the next bill. Bull feathers! As as result of this exchange, I terminated my auto-pay, which I've had for many years, to prevent Comcast from taking more out of my bank account than they're due. I instead sent them a check for the $113.28, which they cashed a couple of days ago and my account now shows a balance of $127 and change. In addition to the credits I was supposed to get, I had called a Comcast technician to investigate a problem with our TV reception. He arrived late, and told me there would be a $20 credit on my next bill. No such credit ever showed up.
__label__0 I signed up to Comcast for the High Speed Internet service. I have been a customer for about a year. I download large files at home and I also up-load files at home also. Apparently Comcast offers a connection to it's customers for 100 Mbps. I have used my task monitor to monitor my speeds and I have never seen any speed downloading any faster than a total of 800 kb per second, meaning 1 tenth of the bandwidth but at a higher price. On the uploading side, they offer 8 Mbps, but the highest speed you get to upload is around 47 kb per second. Far lower than the advertised speeds. I also noticed that Comcast claim to be on-line 24/7 is not real. If I have a peer to peer program running in the backround, I find that my connection has been lost and my computer has been reset or restarted resulting in loss of work performed.  I am also a serious gamer, who plays video games on servers with 50 other peers online at a time. I find that my ping ratio is far greater than the other players. An average ping rate should be between 80 and 150. My ping is variable between 300 and 800, close to 5 times the average. So where is the benefit of Comcast? My service is supposed to be a clear cut line to Comcast, but I find that my line is piggy-backed along with other lines, cutting the benefit of high end users to satisfy the masses, while still charging top dollar across the board. I also realized early on, when you sign up for the Comcast High Speed Internet, they try to sell you the upgraded service for more money. But Buyer beware, because for the more expensive package there are no better results, in fact the results are exactly the same, same bandwidth in the up and down slope as mentioned earlier, therefore when signing up, go for the minimum cost. I spent more money per year on Comcast services than if I had gone with another company offering the same deal on internet services for less, but received the same bandwidth in the up and down slope as Comcast had offered.
__label__1 Have had issues off and on for the past year. Most notable being kicked off the internet while working, and having to reconnect, sometimes as often as several times an hour. Have spent countless hours on the phone with tech support and have had at least 4 technicians come to my home, crawling through the attic, climbing poles outside, and even replacing the modem. And yet the problem persists. At one point last Sept I signed up for "Signature Support" thinking that because I was paying extra for the service, I would get improved service... NOT! Not only did I spend hours on the phone with them trying to resolve problems, but they said the problem was not with the router but the computer. They would gladly fix it for an additional fee (by the way it was NOT the computer). At that point in October I realized this was a scam and called to cancel the service. I documented the phone call because I truly couldn't make this up - it was so absurd. I was on the phone for over 2.5 hours and this is what transpired; the first person I spoke with was in Texas. After explaining the entire situation to her, I was told she was not authorized to remove this service, or charges from my bill. I was then transferred to a gentleman in Manila. Once again explaining the situation, he tried to assure me the service was worth keeping; however I told him I wanted it removed and I wanted an updated bill to document that it actually had been removed. He was not authorized to do so and transferred me to a lady in Manila. Once again I fully explained the situation. After lengthy discussion she said she also could not help me and transferred me to CHICAGO. Once again explaining the situation and asking for an updated bill I was told simply to deduct the fee from my bill. I certainly did not trust this instruction and when I asked again was transferred back to Manila! I gave up!! I did deduct the fee from my bill and could write another paragraph about the results but at this point won't waste more time, other than it took 2 more months and at least 3 more phone calls to get the issue resolved. This company used to be the best around. They expanded TOO fast; with WAY too much decentralization of services to be remotely consumer friendly. In their need to compete with other companies (primarily Uverse in our area) they turned into the antithesis of what they once were. Once again a tech came to my house yesterday. I was told that a month after the service (bundled package) was installed in my home last yr the modem code reverted from the "promotion" code, which gave me complete services, to a previous code (partial service) which was why I continued to have problems throughout the past year. (4 previous tech visits never figured this out) To add insult to injury I received my bill which had increased by $20 this month. I called Comcast to ask why and was told the first year pricing was a promotion and July marked the beginning of the second yr. When I asked to have the bill adjusted for the service I did not receive I was transferred -- guess where??-- tech support in MANILA. Not only did they not know who the technician was whom had come to my house, but they had no idea what he did other than the report which stated "wifi in proper working order". Tech support in Manila has no idea what tech support in Jax is doing. When I told the lady in Manila the problem occurred once again this AM... guess where they sent me?? ---- Signature Support in Manila--- where I was assured that for a fee my problem would be resolved once and for all. Needless to say, and after my previous experience with Signature Support, I completely lost my temper. Won't bore you with the followup. Needless to say... if you are in a community that offers an alternative to Comcast, don't hesitate.
__label__1 I recently called Comcast just to activate internet only because I was going to go with DirecTV. The rep told me that I would pay less if I bundled internet and cable. I asked him to explain the packages to me which he did. He told me that I could get 75 Mbps plus 2 DVR's and one cable box all for $126.90 TOTAL including ALL fees. Guess what? Boxes came yesterday and internet is only 25 Mbps and my bill is $154. When I called CS, they told me that they are not responsible for what their rep discusses over the phone??? How is that possible? I was told that if I wanted 75 Mbps, there would be an extra fee of $10. I asked if they record the conversations and they said they did not know who I spoke with. This just doesn't seem right. If we aren't satisfied for any reason within 30 days, we can cancel.
__label__0    Initital contact to lower cable bill; was quoted (by Danny) $144.95 + tax with installation of telephone line; all else remains same; then connected me with service department; talked with Niecey; she told me bill would increase to $176 plus tax; then recanted and told me $176 plus many other current services still needed to be added to bill;
__label__1 I have been calling Comcast out to my house for almost a year now. They have been out over 6 times. I was told to upgrade for the 50 Mbps and lucky at some points getting about 10. Now since last time a month ago they replaced the modem again and now only getting to 2 Mbps. Now they said I have been paying for 50 Mbps but not having the codes setup for it. Working with them to get fix again and trying to get some sort of credit. Each time I ask for a credit it's amazing how in the peak of the day when I call their sales system is down. But, when call them back to ask to add a package to my account that is working...
__label__1 Comcast sells different tiers of Internet speed that never as fast as advertised. I pay $85/mo for 75 mbps internet; usually I have 20 mbps, and often only 5 mbps(!). Comcast offers to send a service person out, for a charge, and tells me that "Internet speeds are not guaranteed." HOW CAN YOU SELL DIFFERENT SPEEDS THEN? The only way to get their attention is to make a complaint to the FCC (which the FCC recommends).
__label__1 Hate to put my business out there, but after many phone calls and many promises from Comcast, I have nowhere else to turn. My sewage backed up in to my home last Tuesday, so I called the town of Mount Pleasant water company to see if it was on their end. They were quick to come over and use a camera to identify the problem. It turns out there is a cable going right through the pipe line. It created a huge hole in my pipe line and we did not know whose cable it was. So I called the electric company and they were at my home at 9:30pm that night to investigate. It was not theirs, but said it was probably communication/cable. I called Comcast and they did not come until Saturday! They said it was probably theirs and someone would call me that night to get it resolved. It is Monday evening and I'm still waiting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have a hole in my pipe in my backyard! We are a family of four who have to shower, wash dishes, wash clothes and most of all use the facilities!!!!!!!!! Why is this not important to Comcast who we have a freaking bundle pkg with anyway?! This is serious and needs resolution ASAP! My living room floor and dining room hardwood floors have been destroyed by water and my husband and I had to stay home from work to clean the huge mess. I have asked to speak to a supervisor or manager, but they are helping other customers and can't be bothered to call the Albans who need them, not to add or change a premium channel, but fix the mess they made in my backyard and my first floor of my house. Tomorrow will be a week since this started, so let us see if we get a response after this post. After 45 minutes on hold on Tuesday, 10/22/13, we are told by the supervisor that the info will be forwarded to his supervisor. Oh my goodness! We just don't know what to do.
__label__0 I am complaining about the new SmartZone as well as general internet service. Believe me, there is nothing smart about SmartZone--every action can take minutes to perform, so reading and replying to email is at a snail's pace. Sometimes it just won't respond at all, like to reply all. This has been going on for over 3 weeks. At about the same time, our internet in general slowed down also. Pages take forever to open, so surfing the web is not an option. When I contacted them via email they acknowledged problems with SmartZone. When I finally couldn't take it anymore and called them today, I would get disconnected after routing thru their system--this happened 4 times before I finally hit the right digit that didn't just say thank you, goodbye. The person I finally got to also tried to tell me email was a free service, so they would not give any refunds for that. As far as I'm concerned email and internet go hand in hand. I'm running my email thru comcast.net, which is the internet.  We've also had TV signal problems, not able to get a bunch of channels and others freezing up all the time--one guy came out and couldn't figure anything out--finally said we needed a booster--which we have to pay for of course. I declined, and lo and behold, a couple weeks later the channels miraculously started coming in again. Everest is putting cable in in our area right now, and I will be switching as soon as I can. Frustration, not being able to get the shopping, contacts etc that I needed, high blood pressure! Thank goodness this is not a work situation.
__label__1 Cable went out yesterday and spent about 2 hours troubleshooting issue only to be told that they have to send a technician out. Okay so when will tech be here? The only available day is Monday the 19th and yesterday was the 14th. So it takes 5 days to get a tech out to fix an issue. Internet is working but cable is not. I told rep that "Xfinity has to enter my backyard for my neighbors connection and you mean to tell me that I don't get priority" and they couldn't answer that. So I told them that for now on if I have to wait 5 days my neighbors will have to wait also. I knew it was a reason Ieft them for another TV service but I went back because Dish kept raising fees. I'm really pissed because Dish sucks in my area, always having freeze up and DirecTV is terrible. It's football season, no TV and these ** are telling me 5 days before a tech gets out here.
__label__1 Few people realize that Comcast initially lobbied congress to get cable initiated with the promise that the fees paid by customers would make advertising obsolete. Not only did Comcast get that lobbied and modified, but managed to lobby congress to allow advertising volumes to be substantially increased! Now you literally can't hear the show just before an ad and the ad blows your ears off! Shame on congress for screwing us like that! Shame on Comcast for making us pay to watch hours of ads and very little TV shows, and have to pay outrageous dollars for the privilege! 
__label__0 I started working as a remote agent for a company, but in order to do my job proficiently, the software required a cable or dsl consistent internet speed of 4.0 or higher. However, I am only receiving a speed within the 1-3 speed even though I am paying for 6.0. When I called the rep..went through and had me delete this and that and disable stuff like the firewall and virus software etc. Okay, I know how to do this stuff and had already been doing most of this every time prior to connecting to the work program. I however do not feel that I should have to disable my antivirus and firewall (something that protects my personal information and my computer from hackers, and virus) in order to receive a higher speed I am already paying for, which didn't even fix the problem. Are they going to buy me a new computer when I have to disable my protection services in order to get online in the first place..I think not! Are they going to pay the bills or repair any damage that may be caused because someone was able to hack into my computer and steal my personal information..I think not!When they finally scheduled a tech to come out..he could of course find nothing wrong..I was told that due to the powerboost they no longer guarantee a speed of 6.0 or 8.0 etc. That with the powerboost, if someone in the area downloads a file, such as music, an application, game, or is even playing a high speed internet game of any large amount in size, it kicks in the powerboost for them and takes any available bandwidth there is, which therefore lowers your connection speed.Okay, I don't care about the powerboost, quite frankly it does not benefit me the least. I hardly download or upload music, pictures, games etc. So I was happy with the consistent guaranteed speed in which I was paying for in the first place. So, how is this powerboost fair for most general consumers? I'm sure I am not the only one out here who feels the same. Powerboost is geared mostly for those who play games etc. not the everyday person who uses the internet for work and everyday basic home functions. They need to somehow separate the two, and give those that want the guaranteed speed in which they are paying for, and are happy to be without the powerboost, their speed back, and those that want the powerboost, then let them fight with each other over the bandwidth and speeds all in their own little group.Anyway the tech, was really nice and changed out all the cables etc. with new ones..and ran all kinds of tests and said that my speeds are right where they should be, and with the powerboost, it is within excellent range.So, that tells me that they have capped my speed at 3.0, and then when someone else kicks in their powerboost or there is a lot of high traffic, it then kicks me down more to an even lower speed.
__label__1 This was the second time I had to call as they don't change the programming like they say they are going to. I would not even have Comcast but the apartment complex I live in won't let us have DirecTV. 4 more months of living here till our lease is up. Then we will have DirecTV again. Comcast sucks.
__label__0 The company raised my services by over $27/month since December. I understand rate increases but this is excessive and gouging. In current economic climate this only aggravates my level of stress!
__label__0 Comcast has advertised free webcasting of NHL games, and they haven't been able to yet produce a single game. You talk with tech support and all they can offer is a nhl game package at the price of $169.00 dollar. No explanation for the false advertising of the benifit of having digital TV with the package of phone and internet for one price. 
__label__0    We have been Comcast customers since we moved into our new home last summer. Unbelievably, we have had ongoing problems with our phone, Internet, and cable services for an entire year! I am planning on canceling all of our series with Comcast in the very near future. At this moment (11:27 a.m.) I am waiting to speak to yet another supervisor who has no idea why my appointment today from 8:00 to 12:00 is not in the computer. The lady I have been speaking with is trying to convince me that I scheduled an appointment when I will be out of the country next week. I have scheduled service calls at least three times, written them down on my calendar, and waited at home for nothing. Each time I call to see what happened, I am told either there is no appointment scheduled or I have the wrong day. We have had our house rewired several times, our yard has been dug up, and my husband and I have taken off work to wait for technicians who never show up. When technicians do show up, there is no guarantee that they know what to do to fix our problems.  We have had so many problems that we have been refunded money and given a free sports package, but it still cannot make up for countless hours on the phone, countless hours waiting for technicians, and countless hours without reliable service. I have never experienced anything like Comcast's ineptness and disregard for quality service! Every time our phone goes out, our security system goes off-line and our Tivo system cannot provide program information.

__label__1 They simply tick up the cost of their services gradually over time and customers are completely helpless and unable to do anything about it.
__label__1 I want to first say that this is the first time I ever took the time to write a bad review about a company. Being a business owner myself I know what it takes to satisfy my customers but will say Comcast has shown me that they are the worst customer service with no satisfaction company that I have ever had in my 37 years. I am being very honest here about this and it's not personal.
__label__1 I been with Comcast since January, 2011. From paying I believe back then $80-$90, now I'm paying $179.76...for basically the same thing! We have added a new box, that's it! I don't believe it's fair for us loyal customers for our bill to go higher because the "promotional time" has ended. Instead of trying to keep us, you treat us disposable once our contract has ended. To make it worst your costumer services suck!!! When you try to see if there's something else they can offer to lower our bill, we got an answer of "you saved enough money with us through out the yrs" so basically now you are charging me what I saved? Isn't that the reason why we took Comcast in the first place, to save? The person didn't even try to offer me anything. I been 4 yrs with this company, I even moved and continue with your services. I told the person I was going to discontinue the services, the person simple said "ok, let me transfer you to that department"...where obviously he just transfer me to the generated answering service. This is the second time this has happen, last yr same thing my bill then went up to $146, I called, said I will look for another company, Same thing, no one care in Comcast if I stay or go. Last night I went to dinner with a friend, she was in the phone with DISH. She was basically saying if she could get anything for being a loyal customer and she got 3 months of free movies. She then explain how one time they offer to lower her bill with them just offering just the channels she wanted. Isn't that great!! Why pay for channels I don't even watch?? Which I just see them trying to keep her as a customer...plus me, being a new customer, I will get additional discount for 6 months. My friend also told me she used to have Comcast and had to change because the same, too expensive! It's sad to say, but I'm going to have to change. I hate changes! That's why last yr I stayed with you guys but $179, it's ridiculous! I don't even use the house phone. Oh by the way, when I told your customer services if he could take the phone charge away, he just said it will be even higher your bill. I'm moving again soon so most likely I will be moving from you guys as well.
__label__0 I originally signed up with Comcast for their internet service, after talking to the representative I decided to get the all three of the services. The tech had a appointment set between 2pm-4pm. After numerous calls the technician came at 9pm. He did not complete the job until after midnight. Days later I notice that the television is recieving poor reception and the internet is going in and out. I perceeded to call comcast again and another technician came out and we were told that the original technician had not connected the services properly, meaning he never connected the service from the pole. Now service is good until we move August 1, 2008. Technician came out setup cable, internet and phone. One week later we are expericing the same original problems with the internet and the television. I call and speak to a customer service representive that state that they are going to write up a ticket and some will be giving me a call within 24hours. Never happen. Call back one week later. Same scenario. No call. So I decided to just set up an appointment so they can come out. Appointment was set for Sunday September 7, 2008 from 8-10am. No call No show. So of course I call Comcast only to be told that they rescheduled my appointment. So we rescheduled for today September 15, 2008. Appointment time was for 8-10am. Guess what? No call No show! So again I call and speak to a supervisior who states that the appointment had been rescheduled. She apologizes and gave a 20.00 credit and a free premium channel. Not 10 minutes after I get off the phone with her and my newly rescheduled appointment a tehnician shows up at the door. Who states Oh, they just rescheduled your appointment and I not doing an appointment that they just rescheduled. So I ask for the supervisor name and he would not give me the information. I asked his name in which I got a Mario. I asked again for the supervisor name and was told to call Comcast. So here we go again. I call and was told that he should have done the job and that they would get someone out there and I recieved another credit, for how much don't know and don't care. This is the worse service known to man!The damage is that I pay my bill on time and don't get full service.
__label__0 I have been a customer of Comcast for years.  I live in four apartment complex.  I have had trouble with my cable service constantly.  They have come here at least 8 times within the last 7 months.  They fix the problem each time and then something else happens to it.  My neighbors have no problem with their cable.  I try to tell these repair people that it has been a major problem with the service in my apartment.  Their remedy is to credit my account for the inconvenience.  I want the service that I pay for.I came home from work yesterday and its not working.  They sent a refresh to the boxes and told me to wait twenty minutes.  After thirty minutes, I still had no service.  In my computer room I have a TV that doesn't have a box and the cable wire goes directly to the TV.  Guess what, it works.  I told Comcast about this.  They can't get anybody out here until Sunday between 11 am and 2 pm.  I pay my bill on time.  I should get the service.  In the last 30 days, this is the third time I had to call them and be without service.  I am going to write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper about this matter.  Maybe after Comcast sees this letter, they will realize I and other customers are tired of the inconvenience we have been put through.
__label__1 Comcast is a piece of **. They false advertisement. Be advised they will ** rob your money and their customer service sucks. They hang up the phone every time I call. I'm sick of this and the only reason I even rated it one star is because that's the only way I could rate. Y'all gonna go out of business 'cause I'm suing. Have a nice day!!!
__label__1 My cable/internet has been on the blink for over a month now and Comcast has sent 7 technicians over the past few weeks with each visit being the same - "I can't fix it but I will send the guy who can." I call customer service and they tell me they will get a technician out and I keep repeating the same thing that they have sent technicians and in my opinion they don't know what's wrong because it's not resolve. I have to go out to watch the playoffs because the sports channels say "tuning error". I truly have been patient but I'm growing tired of this. You can't talk to a supervisor, manager etc. Just in my opinion folks who are trained to say "I am sorry for the inconvenience " or "I will send someone out " - Waiting on the eighth visit and if no resolve I will cancel because I'm not gonna pay for what I don't use.
__label__1 I've been having trouble with my Comcast internet service for several months, and I've called them repeatedly. My supposed high-speed internet service is slower than dial-up. Websites are constantly freezing and crashing my computer, and I couldn't stream a video without it freezing up for 10-15 minutes several times during a 40-minute show. Comcast said it was my fault, and they told me just reset my modem. When it got to the point where I was resetting my modem 20-30 times a day and I was still getting only intermittent, very slow connections, I called yet again. I was told to take my old modem in and get a new one. When I plugged in the brand new modem, it not only took out my internet connection, it killed my phone service. I had to take several trips back and forth to a pay phone begging them to do something. I had to wait until the next week before they'd send someone out. I waited all day and they never bothered to show up. I found out later, after another trip out to a pay phone, that they had called me and when I didn't answer my non-working phone, they decided to blow me off. So, they refused to come out and fix my non-functional phone service because my phone service doesn't work. It's unbelievable that anyone can be that stupid! I finally got someone to come out and replace the modem, and now I'm back to where I started. I have phone service back, but my connection is extremely slow to non-existent. Websites constantly freeze and crash, and I don't have enough connection speed to stream a video. They have been screwing me around for months, and they haven't done a freaking thing to fix the problem. All they've done is made it worse. And the customer reps act like it's a big hassle to actually take my call and do their job. They're smug, mouthy, insulting, and they act by turns bored and put upon. I've had it. There's yet another person supposed to come out tomorrow. If he doesn't show or doesn't fix it once and for all, I'm transferring my service to a different company. I've had Comcast for years, but they have really hit the skids. Lousy equipment, lousy service, and lousy attitude. I'm sick of Comcast. They suck.
__label__0 After one month and endless hours of frustration with comcast, our service was finally connected and and working. Due to the long delay in getting our service up, comcast forgave the first months bill for over $170. Within the week however, comcast cut our service for not paying the bill. During this time I have asked to speak with a supervisor no less than 8 times. Always, I am told that one is available but that one would call me back within 24 hours. To date, not one supervisor has called me back to discuss our issues. The day we were disconnected, the line was dropped three times and twice by the same technician. I am finally going to give up and switch to the dish. We were the last holdouts on our street to do so, and now I know why. Hours and Hours of time, phone bills, waiting for technicians that don't show, disconnected service, disconnected access to our business e-mail... etc...
__label__1 Comcast/Xfinity is by far the worst Cable & Internet provider ever. I completely agree with the reviews, because they are indeed accurate and this I know because I'm a customer who regrets signing up for service. I work from home and I'm constantly calling Comcast to report Internet problems such as: slow connections although I'm paying for the fastest and highest one that have. My modem freezes constantly and takes forever to reboot. My horrible internet is always disconnecting and saying that I have no Internet Service available and it's a complete waste to call Customer Service, because all that do is lie and give you the runaround. This is the second largest bill in my home which is ridiculous. I'm paying close to $300 a month for ** service that barely works...The info on "My Account" is inaccurate. I was told that I had 12 days to pay my bill before service would be interrupted, so I was surprised when I tried to access the Internet to start my work shift only to find out that I needed to contact Comcast, because my service was temporarily disconnected. This has happened twice and on today, I turned on my TV to see a message from Comcast that I needed to pay $29.30 to restore my service. Are you kidding me, when I just paid $280.00 on Friday, April 15th...? Is Comcast that hard up for money? I would say "Absolutely" which is absurd. Make sure you always check the 'Bill Details' because it's there when you'll find extra hidden fees.Why is there 9 different "Taxes, Surcharges & Fees" and there are 5 different "Other Charges & Credits" on top of a list of other things...? Comcast will double charge you and once you bring it to their attention, their answer is always "You'll see a Credit on YOUR NEXT BILL." I'm thinking, why the next bill, when the mistake/error was on this one? If they do give you a 'CREDIT' trust and believe, they have recompensated for this by overcharging you in another area. Don't believe me? Check your bill!!!I think we all need to come together and start a 'Class Action Lawsuit' against Comcast/Xfinity. I'm definitely about to talk to a Lawyer, because I'm so fed up with them. You could be calling about a problem you're having and the first and only thing they're thinking about is: "Would you like to make a payment?" If there was another Service Provider in my area, I could guarantee that Comcast would have no business and this is why they feel like they can and is taking advantage of their customers. There are thousands of people who I talk to who call in to vent about their unhappiness with Comcast. What a hike and disgrace!!!
__label__1 I am in my third year of dealing with Comcast's deceit and barely legal business practices. In 2014 I wanted to leave Comcast for its poor performance both technically and customer support. I called them and asked if there would be any contract charges to cancel my account at which time they answered no. I asked them to confirm their answer and once again was told there would be no contract charges to cancel my account. I asked for the customer service rep's name and was told Kit and only Kit although I asked for further identification.When I actually cancelled my account they informed me that there was a $90 contract charge to cancel and thus began the three year headache. I attempted to resolve this via email with no response. I attempted to resolve this via customer service only to be told my option was to resume as a Comcast customer. I asked to speak to a supervisor only to be dumped into a voice mailbox with no return call. I asked for assistance by a Comcast salesperson with the company I work for with no follow thru.I paid all charges but the $90 and let that go to collections. I wrote letters to the collection company disputing the charge only to have it keep turning up like a bad penny. I finally settled today for less than the full $90 but have little hope that they will not turn up again seeking to collect the remainder. I was informed by this collection agency that Comcast is attempting to refresh its customer service image due to all the negative press. Personally I think they have failed miserably as a company with abysmal customer service. I would go completely off grid if my only choice for service was Comcast. If you have an option choose anything other than Comcast. They are crooks, then and now.
