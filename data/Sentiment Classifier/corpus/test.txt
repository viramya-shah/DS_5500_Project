__label__0 As always I tried to contact Comcast for interrupted cable TV service and excessive monthly charges, instead they offered to fix the issue and upgrade my program.After the call, I could not access ANY of the offered premium channels. A technician was scheduled but not before having three troubleshooting calls with different Support Reps.Long story short, the technician arrived as scheduled and left me just the local channels (no premium or digital access at all). No surprise I'm getting only 24 channels and paying $45 a month for unlimited premium access.When asked to speak with supervisors I get the same line: All our supervisors are currently servicing other customer but will be calling you in one hour. It's been 72 hours and still no call.After 10 calls and 5 hours on the line, I was transferred to a Supervisor under the name of Marie (they never provide an employee # or last names) who just gave me the 1800 number for complaints (1-800-762-3189).I'm currently fighting to avoid this to happen to anyone in the future by going in to every blog and website I find in the Internet about Comcast.
__label__0 I signed a two year agreement and was to receive a $300 gift check within 6-8 weeks.  I've mad numerous phone calls to unhelpful and rude service reps who told me to stop calling because I was not going to receive my check.  The original service rep who placed my order did it incorrectly and although my record shows I'm eligible, I have not received my promotional offer. I wonder how many other comsumers were scammed. I would never have signed the agreement and to terminate would cost additional money in loss.  I was counting on the gift card for gas and possibly to pay my comcast bill.
__label__1 Comcast has locked out other competitors in my locality and are total monopoly. They hike prices, send incomprehensible bills and sneak in hazy charges. Internet and TV reception has been progressively getting very bad, lots of freezing, hang ups, it has become unreliable. Their customer service, horrible - half of the reps don't have any idea what they are talking about. I detest the fact that I have no choice and am stuck in a cast literally with - that's right, Comcast! Triple Play with a bill now over $200 per month cause hear this: I can't choose what I want, it has to be "Bundles". This is totally unjust. Something should be done to have more competitors come in. I would switch to another in a flash, if it was not an ugly dish!
__label__1 If you have the choice to choose someone else besides Xfinity or Comcast, please do so! Take this review and learn from my mistake of choosing them! Their customer service is the worst I have ever dealt with in a company. And this is on multiple accounts! The employees do not care about whether you are satisfied or happy with your service. And the employees have no idea what they are talking about! I have been hung up on many times through transfers with departments with no call back, and I have been given the wrong equipment 3 times. By far the worst company I have ever dealt with. I would never recommended them!
__label__1 I called Comcast to ask one simple question. What is my Server Name IP Address? I spent one hour and 37 minutes on the phone, spoke to 9 representatives, none of which where technicians and was disconnected 3 times. I was sent to a third party contracting company, sent to Comcast, who transferred me to Xfinity who told me that they couldn't help me and transferred me back to Comcast, who finally sent me to a number that said their offices were closed. At the end of the evening, I had no assistance and had very ill informed representatives. Comcast gave me a major runaround. I am still left with a modem that I am renting from them that will not connect to my desktop and yet no one seemed to care. I am dropping my service with them and I would recommend staying far, far away from Comcast and Xfinity which are really the same company. What a sad way to conduct business. Perhaps a more competent leadership is in order.
__label__1 If you can help it - do not use Comcast. I moved and transferred service - had their new X1 platform box installed (what a disaster). First the young man drilled a hole in my hardwood floor in the bedroom. Drilled in the wrong place. No plugs near the hole. His response, "I guess I should have asked." He left not showing us how to operate anything. He had not been gone 15 minutes when the cable went out. I called Comcast right away to have him come back and they said they could not do that since he was on his way to another job. They said they could have someone come out on Wednesday - this happened on Saturday. Young man came out on Wednesday - could not fix the problem - called and told them I wanted to have someone come out. They said it would be Saturday. Got up on Thursday - No Cable - No Phone - No Internet. Called - I am sorry is all they could say. Could not get a Tech. until Saturday. Canceled service and I am going with Wow. So if you can do not go with Comcast. Does the ole saying "Liar, Liar, pants on fire," ring a bell.
__label__1 Unfortunately where I live I have Comcast cable  not only is it ridiculously overpriced but the service is terrible. A few weeks ago I started losing all of my HD channels. I contacted Comcast to report the problem and of course the customer service representative could not figure out the problem and said a technician needed to come to my house. I specifically asked if I was going to be charged for this since it was an issue with the cable and was told that as long as the problem was due to the cable and not the wiring in my house there would be no charge  even though they were attempting to have me add some ridiculous protection plan. Technician comes out and has to change the boxes again (second time in less than 2 years) and lo and behold I get my bill which has a charge for the technician. Of course I contact Comcast again only to speak to another customer service representative and a supervisor who cannot help me even though they can see that I didn't sign anything stating I would be charged and that they understand I was told I wouldn't be charged but there is nothing they can do about it. The customer service is terrible and apparently no one who works at Comcast is able to provide answers or assistance.
__label__1 The Wifi is going back to dial up - call customer service - not only do they have no idea on the service but barely speak English - definitely call center is NOT in the United States. Frontier was 150 percent better. They sell you a faster wifi service but the signal is NOT there. I want to cancel but now I'm locked in by contract!
__label__1 I received a DVR on Jan 28 2011, the tech came installed everything and by the time I came home from work, it was not working properly. All of the features on the remote did not work and the box would tell that I did not have certain access to channels and I should call xfinity. It was channel 2, it also happened with HD channels.So I called the 800 number and got a very nice customer service rep name Harold. It took him 45 minutes to zip my box so it would work, I was grateful. I came home from work the next day same problem. I called xfinity again and got Harold (to my surprise) again. Again, it took him 45 minutes to zip the box and I also informed him that the remote did not work. He tried codes for another 15 minutes (which is now 1 hour I am on the phone with him) just for him to tell me that I need a new remote. Next day same thing happened to my surprise. Guess who I get, yes Harold again (is he the only rep that works there after 6pm EST?). 45 minutes later, box working but this time said he is sending tech. He made an appointment. Technicians came on time and said they fixed the box. Two days later, same thing happened. I call xfinity again. This time, I tell them I want a new box and the CS tells me that I will be charged. I argue with him get my appointment and wait for my appointment. I get a bill before the rep comes and its outrageous. I take it to the Comcast center in Morgantown WV and they adjust it and also take off bill form service call because they see problem is not fixed. This is on February 15, 2012. She verifies my appointment for Saturday, February 18 for 2:30pm-4:30pm. Come Friday the 17th, the box pops and turns off. I call xfinity. Yet, again the rep gets it to work but no sound. 1 hour and 15 minutes later, we have picture and sound and he said hopefully it will work until my techs get there tomorrow February 18, 2012 between 2:30-4:30pm. Saturday comes no techs, no call, and no sound on TV. I call xfinity and get a rude CSR and rude manager. They first try to tell me my appointment is for the 25th when the manager at the Morgantown office and the CSR on Friday saw the appointment and on top of that, the automated system when I called verified my appointment for that day. This funky so called manager tried to insult my intelligence and tell me different and then tells me I can take time off my job and go to the office and get a new box, then tried to insult me with a $20.00 credit. I informed him that since I pay for the triple play and I dont have it I will be paying only for the internet because the box doesn't work. I don't know where they get these people from but I know one thing they say New Yorkers are rude and I from New York, and not one time have I ever had this problem with Time Warner Cable. I hope that they come to Morgantown, WV and know Comcast out the box, and there will be a lot of very grateful people. 
__label__1 Overcharged me and cut my service off - They cannot explain why they are charging me $256.00 and wants $170.00 before they will turn my cable back on. I have bank statements dated back November of 2011 showing all the payments that Ive made and that I am paid up until May 22nd, 2012.
__label__1 Comcast cable is BY FAR the worst company I have ever done business with in over 40 years, I will explain why. PROBLEM 1: I signed up for Comcast cable about 2 months ago. I asked a few specific questions, the first one being "IS ON DEMAND FREE" they answered "YES."  If you call sales and ask that question today they will answer "YES TODAY." When I went to access "The Blacklist" which is on a free network. I could NOT access anything other than the current season. This was WEEK ONE of the second season. so I wanted to catch up with season 1. I have TO PAY FOR THAT! NOW my thinking IT'S EITHER FREE OR ITS NOT!!! IF you call sales today and ask "is on demand free" They will say yes. IT IS NOT FREE IT IS A LIE!!! The SHOULD say ONLY CURRENT SEASONS ARE FREE.. so for example if its week one of season 2. YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK! This is PROBLEM 1 of MANY with Comcast Cable.PROBLEM 2: I asked if National GEO channel was included in my UPGRADED PACKAGE that I purchased. They said it was. After 30 days I couldn't access NAT GEO. I called and they said it was included BUT ONLY FOR 30 DAYS. I ASKED IF IT WAS INCLUDED! THEY SAID YES! They NEVER SAID for only 30 days! THAT IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE!PROBLEM 3: I paid $50 for installation. I agreed to pay $50 for installation. When I received my bill it said $50 for installation AND AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE FOR A technician VISIT. So they charge you for an technician and a ADDITIONAL FEE for a tech visit. UNLESS they have robots it should be ONE FEE. THIS IS A TOTAL RIPOFF! HOW can you charge an installation fee and the charge an ADDITIONAL FEE for a technician visit! IT IS INCLUDED! PROBLEM 4: The hold time are in excess of 45 minutes most times! AND after holding for 45 minutes you are usually ticked off. If you get upset on the phone, THEY JUST HANG UP ON YOU! I read this in the reviews on GOOGLE REVIEWS so I know I am NOT they only person this has happened to. PLUS it has happened MORE THAN ONCE to me.PROBLEM 5: There NEW X1 box is supposed to be the TOP OF THE LINE BOX. I had 3 that were defective, I have several pictures on my phone of the problems. this box NEEDS TO BE RESTARTED AT LEAST 2 times a day, PLEASE see google reviews. It freezes up ALL THE TIME. You can't change the channel without restarting WHICH TAKES ABOUT 10 minutes. THAT'S NOT FUN in the 4th Quarter when you are watching your favorite team. I have had many more problems with COMCAST cable but we can start with the top 5. LET'S see what they will do to resolve these. I URGE YOU TO CHECK the reviews on the Internet.  MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS! THIS COMPANY JUST DOESN'T CARE. They are in my opinion THE WORST COMPANY ON THIS PLANET!
__label__0 I just moved to the Frederick area. Since 2001, I have had access to NASA TV since I am a space buff through Dish Network, a local cable company back in Minnesota where I used to live, and DirecTV. I have contacted Comcast multiple times and have got mixed responses. I have been told there are plans in the works, no plans at all, it will be added this year, and just today no information.I am getting very, very upset that a national company won't carry a free channel and will carry foreign channels. I have looked at other cities that have Comcast and some of them have it. Why won't Comcast add it to the lineup of channels in the state of Maryland, which has a NASA center, is anyone's guess?Also, a lot of the time I get a tiling screen or the picture freezes along with audio or the audio won't be there. Also, Comcast doesn't have the HD channels as they claim to have. By my count, not including the local channels, there are 32 HD channels, not near the number they say they do. I have had better experience with Satellite in terms of cost, quality of customer service, variety of channels, basically everything! I laugh at Comcast!
__label__1 They charged me EFT return fee. They cannot explain the reason. All they say is, "Call your bank." My bank said there was not any charge from Comcast. I called 5-6 agents. They all said they can't see why there is a charge. I wasted 2-3 hours of my time.
__label__0 waiting aft 3rd call for low phone line aft storm yesterday
__label__0 We have had Comcast for several years and it has slowly gotten worse. We have the televison,internet and phone service through them. When ever it rains even a sprinkle, all three services go out. On the 13th of the this month they sent out a tech who told me my problem was not in the house but on the box outside. He said squirrels could have gotten into it. He told me someone else would need to come over for that. I ended up having to hire someone to work for me at my shop that day just to be told he was not the one who needed to be sent out.  I asked him if I  needed to be here for the tech outside and he said no. Yesterday and today my entire service was out again from the rain and they said they had repaired that problem on the 15th. I told them I was having the same problem and wanted new service equipment run or I would be cancelling their service. They were suppose to be here between 11-2 and it is 4:06 no show.Other people that I have spoken to that have Comcast do not have this problem. They say they have pixeling, but they have not lost servive as much as I do. There is no problem when the sun is shining. I have paid for service that I am not getting. I keep track of non-service only to be told that unless I report it I cannot have it deducted. I can't report it when I do not have phone service. I have had to pay some one to work for me at my business to be home.
__label__1 In March 2011, I joined a leads group from the Fort Wayne Chamber of Commerce. My sister and I were getting ready to open up a gift store in downtown Fort Wayne. A representative from Comcast was a member of that leads group. She talked to us about a great deal Comcast was offering at that time - $129 for 2 phone lines and internet service. Knowing we were going to need these services for our gift store, I told her I was interested and she gladly set everything up for me. She never once mentioned anything about a $300 installation fee or having to sign a three-year contract. She had me sign for the service.After the services were installed, I received a bill for over $400 and was shocked. I did pay the bill even though I was upset she never mentioned the installation fee. Today, June 27, 2012, I called to cancel the service since my sister and I are closing our gift store. That's when I was told I signed a three-year contract and I would have to pay a $2,000 fee to get out of the contract! I was beyond shocked! First of all, she never even mentioned that I was signing a three-year contract. I never would have signed a three-year contract because my lease was only for two-years!This Comcast representative never mentioned anything in regards to not being able to cancel this service at will. It's very deceptive and after reading the thousands of complaints, I'm not sure where to turn. A supervisor was supposed to call or email me but nothing. I want to nip this in the bud now before this turns into something that drags on for months. I don't trust them as far as I can throw them!
__label__0 We upgraded our program to the next highest level of channels. The sound when commercials are on is deliberately increased, and on multiple channels not just one offender. This happens every day, and especially late at night. They have disturbed our sleep on several occasions, woke us up on at least one dozen occasions. I believe this is an invasion of privacy, and they should be stopped. 
__label__1 We signed up for the Double Play Cable Service with Comcast and I have never been so disappointed with a Company that I have been with this one. They tell us one thing and does something else. Our first bill was due on August 31st and soon after that there was another bill due September 10th and we never told that we would have to pay a month in advance and to top it off the installer brought the wrong cable box for our Living room television and it wasn't showing properly. The 1st time went to the office Susan told us she would waive the installation fee and also told us we had the wrong box for the Living room and said she would also accommodate us with a premium channel which never happened. We went back again and the 2nd gentleman gave us another deal at $20.00 off for 6 months but we still had a bill $160.00. Long story short, the installation fee never got waived.... Our bill was suppose to be $106.00 and was still $160.00 from July to October... Never seen a company so unorganized. We are done!
__label__1 We have two problems with Comcast/Infinity.1. The company is not sending us notification regarding our bills. Consequence is the company turns off our cable. The reason we are told is that it takes 2 months or more to set up a credit card automatic payment. We have had credit card automatic payments for years. We have tried to update card information due to credit card security breaches in other companies. They bill us three months at a time when this problem occurs.2. Recently they have began demanding we upgrade our modem. They have told us that ours has outlived its usefulness. Results: no internet connection thru MSN, Juno or Infinity. Often the connection is disrupted when we are able to connect. We can still connect and have no problems with Google. When we called regarding the problem, we ended up with a high pressure salesperson who would not fix our internet service but continually repeated we had to buy or lease a new modem. After half an hour I told her we were NOT buying a new modem, fix our internet or I would write the FCC. Our Internet began working immediately. We still have problems when we use Infinity, Juno or MSN. And now we are getting phone calls, and letters from Comcast regarding our need to upgrade to a new modem so we can use their higher speed internet. We are happy with our current speed, our current modem is paid for and a privately owned one, why do we have to pay for a higher speed and buy a new modem?
__label__1 I began having issues with my internet from day 1, but recently was the best of the worst. I had issues for about 15 days straight, and had 'bullets' sent to my modem at least once a day. So about 10 days ago a tech came over. Now since I disconnected my modem overnight the stupid thing decided to work when the tech connected it. I asked for a replacement since it was at least 10 years old and he wouldn't so it wouldn't come up as a service call which made no sense at all. Today I called, wasted 35 minutes and tomorrow they will replace it, only because I didn't want to waste my time driving 20 miles round trip, or want to pay a fee to have it mailed. Why would I pay a fee when they told me its an outdated piece of equipment. I am paying good money plus insurance to have proper service. You want me to go pick it up? Have it closer to me. Comcast is the worst. I am seriously thinking about FiOS just to get some upgrades for a few years. By then maybe some good from NY might come down.
__label__0 We moved from one side of Lafayette to the other.  I was told by Comcast to  bring my equipment to the new location and a transfer of my services would be  completed.  The Comcast employee who came yesterday, was a contractor and  assured me that all services had been sucessfully transferred.  Before he left, I checked for a dial tone, my email and television stations.  I did not call my home number from my cell number, which I should have as my telephone number was changed without  any notification to me.  I noticed the change when I logged on this morning to retrieve my email messages.  At the bottom of log-on page it states how many new emails and voicemails I have received per email address or telephone number. Had I known that my telephone number of  21 years would change due to digital issues by Comcast, I would have switched  back to AT&T.  So far, customer service has pretty told me sorry, there's  nothing we can do.  Mark, a supervisor (ID #34185) ,stated it would be at least 48 hours before they would know if they could retrieve my  number from back from A T&T.  I have ordered checks with our new address and home business cards.    Please Help!A side note:  the Comcast voicemail system goes down often.  We lost a lease as the lease agent called left a message which I wasn't able to retrieve for three days.  We needed a quick answer and thought she was dragging her heals.  She is a high strung individual and so we didn't want ot bombard her with calls and waited until she called back - a message we received too late.*Checks need to be reprinted. *lost lease on a Moraga condo *Stationary needs to be reprinted. My time to contact friends, family, school and business contacts of telephone number change.
__label__1 June 25, after attempt to self connect the internet myself, not working. June 30 I call Comcast. A lady ask me to do phone trouble shooting, still not working, so she said the modem defective, she will send me another one in 3~5 business days. After 1 week did not receive. I call, they said sometimes it takes longer. Another week (so it is 2 week) I called back because still did not receive the modem. The CS said, that he cannot locate any order sent out, so he said there is no modem sent out yet, because he just found the work order. I request to talk to Supervisor. The Supervisor talk to me and give me solution that the next Monday (I called on Saturday), tech will come to my house at 7~8 am. Monday morning my sister in law wait on the sofa next to front door from 6:30 am to 9:30 am, nobody come. She even called me if I give them the right address, I said yes.So when I came home the next Sunday July 26 I called Comcast. She said she only have next appt on August 3. I said I need it earlier because it's more than a month to connect my service and my daughter need to finish her homework on early August. "And why the tech not come?" She cannot answer. I ask for Supervisor. The Supervisor need me to review everything of my story again, but he keep cutting the story, and when I ask if the Comcast tech really came to my house that Monday, he answer, "I cannot say yes or no." I don't even know what that means so I ask a higher manager to talk, But He (initial D) insist that he is the one who responsible to solve my problem, and refuse to let me talk to someone else. So I said I cannot understand him, and I ask "should I just close my account?" He said "you can do it, if that's what you want to do" and he said he's going hang up on me because I cannot talk the higher manager. Only they the one who can call me. So he hang up on me. Around 10 minutes later he (initial D) the same person call me back at a more calm voice (he was aggressive on the first call) and said that's the earliest appt he can give to me but he don't even have the early morning. So he even can only give me the next day August the 4th morning and warn me if 7~9 its mean the tech can come at 9 and I have to answer their phone call and that they can finish the job for hours and hours later so I have to be ready to stay home all the hours. Which is mean he warn me I cannot go to work. He keep insist he is in the right position after fail to connect my internet for more than a month.This is a ridiculous situation and not even one word of sorry they said and keep arguing with me after keep breaking all their promise. So watch out customers.
__label__1 I move and transfer service. Instead of moving your service Comcast train their staff to lock you in a new contract without you knowing even if you have service for the last 5 years with them. My bill was 2300 from when I move in December 18 until Feb 1. I receive a bill for 2300 that's overprice stealing from customer tricking them that the bill is 150. A month from when I start to 320 for cable I did not even have HBO are and premium channel. What am I been charge for this is a rip-off. Comcast is only want money from customer but lack service. Even the internet speed they turn down very slow, must be for retarded people. Watching your bill Comcast charge overcharge for channel that should be free. They also force you to sign a contract when transfer service without you knowing. They just prey on customers for money and all you get is reruns. If you have to pay for rerun just sign up for Netflix, you get what you pay for. Do not sign up for Comcast because out of 60 channels only 3 or 4 is any good. It's a waste and a shame Comcast steal from their customer. What you pay for you never get. Comcast rob me. 
__label__0 I've had been a customer of comcast once before and the service was horrible. They advertise their ON DEMAND program to get you to subscribe and half the time I tried to use it I had technical difficulties. I just recently moved and I had no choice but to sign up with them again because DirecTV is not available in my area. I've had comcast for 4 days now and I've had to call them 3 times regarding my service. I ordered a DVR cable box and 10 minutes after the technician left the box stopped working. The ON DEMAND feature is yet to work for both cable boxes and when I called for some assistance, the operator had no idea why my service wasn't working. If they can't explain and refuse to refund any money for faulty service then I don't believe a company like this should be in business. They act like they don't care because they have a monopoly on cable service in South Florida.
__label__1 Xfinity Program Installation - A technician came to the house on Feb. 16th, 2012 and tried to install an upgrade to Xfinity Program. He cut the exterior cable and left without any notification. We have been out of a house phone and TV for 6 days. After calling the 800 266 2278 number we've been put on hold, disconnected several times and passed around from agent to agent-finally went on line to try and make progress but the problem was not resolved. They wanted us to wait another 24-72 hours. So a "higher department" can contact us. When I asked for a corporate contact - They typed: We don't have that number!! Seriously? We're still without phone and TV!
__label__1 As has happened with others, I received a letter urging me to upgrade my modem. The letter stated, in the fourth paragraph: "To protect our environment, please properly recycle your older modem... Please note that there is no unreturned equipment fee for your older modem." Then, on my latest bill, I received a monthly charge for this modem. When I called, I was essentially told "Too bad, you have to return it or face monthly charges."
__label__1 They say that they have the fastest internet, it's lie. I pick the fastest package they have because I have multiple gadgets that are connected to the internet at the same time. Guess what, some of my items are never able to connect on the internet. One time I was on the phone with their customer service rep. more than 5 hours, but they were not able to solve the issue. I have a smart TV which was only able to be connected on the internet once... useless. I will never ever get them again, and I am going to tell everyone I know not to get them. False advertisement.
__label__1 I tried to stay loyal for years with Comcast because they used to be somewhat fair. Now they are just extremely greedy. I have used another Internet provider for years. Called clear communications, which werent the greatest but it was only $20.00 a month. Well every time I called into Comcast they would try to push their Internet on me. This one lady was so desperate for the sale she wouldn't take no for an answer and she tricked me by saying, "Will you at least try it under no obligation?" I was on vacation at the time and wanted to wait until I got home and advised her I would call back. She advised me that I needed to be put in that day to get the deal. She said the equipment wouldn't be sent until I returned home and called. I agreed and then I got home and called to tell them that I changed my mind and wasn't interested. They billed me every month for a year for the Internet and the equipment and I never had any equipment in my house or the Internet ever. I called every month for a year and spent hours and hours trying to get them to remove it. They would just talk over you or run you around in circles with some bogus excuse until you were exhausted. I continued to pay because I didn't want this to hit my credit. I then got so frustrated I stopped paying that portion of the bill until it was resolved. They just added late charges every month. I finally just stopped paying the bill and will dispute it later. I've had it with their bullying tactics and refusal of customer service. They are like Wal-Mart. Made all their money and now have most people brain washed that they have the cheapest product and then they slowly increase the price and throw in misc. charges. Comcast you have lost this customer forever. I will find another way!
__label__5 We pay good money to have cable, internet, phone, with Comcast Xfinity and the service is always going out. I would like to understand why there are always problems! Anytime we call, they tell us they are working on it but there is nothing they can do for us. Meanwhile 6 hours later, we may or may not have cable. I'm mostly upset because they don't care about the customer. I was with Bright House for 5 years, never this many problems. But I can't get Bright House here, it's a shame.
__label__1 I was your customer for many years until I sold my house on May 31st, 2014. I called mid-May 2014 to ask you to forward my service to my new home at **. I was told I had to wait 5 days to see if Comcast serviced that area. Comcast called me and said no they don't service the area. I asked if I would have to pay the termination fees and was told NO. I was also told that you would send me boxes for the equipment. I gave the address to send the boxes three times and they never came. Instead, I received threatening phone calls about the equipment mid-June. I took the equipment to one of your locations because the boxes never came. On June 17th I called in to pay the balance on my account. It said $59, so I paid it. I then received a bill in the mail from you for $305 so I called in again and was told the balance on my account was $0.00. I then started getting calls from a collection agency, Diversified, who said I owed Comcast $305 so, again today, I called in and spent over one hour with your company who disconnected me three times and sent me to several different departments, billing, collections, customer satisfaction dept (?). Each department told me something different. I was told my account was switched with another person named Ryxxxx who got my payment instead, and then I was disconnected by Comcast. I called back and was told they don't know what I am talking about and I was told that I never made a payment of $58 (PLEASE SEE PROOF OF THIS PAYMENT FROM MY BANK). I was then told I owe the money and that's final!!
__label__1 A bigger more complete group of non-caring, lazy, non-knowledgeable group of people couldn't be found on earth. So I tepidly took part of an offer to drop DirecTV. They installed. Within 3 or 4 days one of the boxes (box 1) failed to work as advertised. I called and spoke to a "tech". He essentially told me what I was seeing wasn't real. "The box doesn't work that way". Then sir, how come box 2 in the other room works the way it was advertised. He kept insisting it doesn't. Send a "tech". "Tech" arrives and replaces box 1, commenting he hadn't seen one of those boxes before. Several days later box 3 fails. Can't control the tv. Call the tech who again starts arguing with me and essentially tells me to reset the box over and over, which I had done previously a number of times. I hung up on her.Send "tech". Tech arrives and says a bunch of connectors are loose. Goes around and with wrench and supposedly tightens all the connectors. Everything fine. Four or 5 days later box 3 fails again. Same thing, can't control tv. Call "tech" again. I now believe there is something wrong with the box. "Tech" offers to send me a new box / remote. I say, "Why can't I just go down to the local junkyard err store and get new ones?" "You can't do that." They don't have H/W. I hang up and go down to the local junkyard the next morning and exchange. Ask about my bill which is also screwed up of course. "We don't do bills here."Go home install the new H/W and all is OK. All this time I'm sending the salesman e-mails, texts and calling. Ask for some help, an explanation of my bill by 6 pm the next work day or I'm going to cancel, thank god there is a 30 day cancellation policy. He replies finally saying he doesn't know what to do. Really? He gives me his supervisor's e-mail and phone # saying he'll be out of pocket. I write Francine and e-mail, including all the e-mails I've been complaining to Greg about. She replies, can you send me your phone #! Are you telling me this giant company doesn't know my phone #? OK. I send Francine my #. Of course I never hear from her again. The night before I ripped out the junk and returned to the junkyard box 2 fails. How fitting.
__label__1 We had a Comcast "tech" guy come to our house 12 days ago to update our modem as recommended by Comcast. It has been an absolute disaster. Ever since he came, our wi-fi signal was too weak to reach an upstairs office. Everyone who we have called (and I have spoken to 13 people today alone), has been completely unknowledgeable about the Comcast system and given me the complete run-around. I have asked numerous times to speak to a supervisor, only to be put on hold for 20-30 minutes, then explained my situation. Have them tell me how sorry they are. Tell my why it isn't a problem or not their fault, then tell me it is not actually their department, and transfer me to another area, with another 20-30 minute wait. The last person I spoke with told me they would fix the wi-fi problem, which they did by disconnecting every device from our modem so that now it is an even bigger problem! ! They are the WORST company I have ever had to deal with! I have tried to get them come back out to fix the problem they created and they will only do it if I pay the technician fee again. We never wanted the update and it has only created a huge problem.
__label__0 In May 2009, I entered into contract to upgrade my services with Comcast. I was told I would receive cable, phone service and the highest available speed internet service for the price of $114.99 all inclusive (taxes, modem, etc.). I confirmed the price and services with the Comcast representative at least six times to make sure there was no misunderstanding. I agreed to the offer as offered to me by the Comcast representative. I have since been overcharged twice, the first time was an "error" of approximately $30-35 (which was later resolved). My last bill was for $130.31, not the $114.99 I was repeatedly promised. Calls to Comcast (Ann/May?) to resolve the matter were absolutely useless (she claimed the extra charges were for modem rental and taxes, neither of which were stated as "extra charges" by the original representative when I accepted). I had been told each time I asked that the $114.99 cost included everything and a promise of a call from the supervisor from that representative never came. I went to the local Comcast office on Tuesday where not only was it not resolved, but I was informed I was not even getting the promised highest speed internet either. On 9/14, I called the Comcast escalation department and spoke to David. I was essentially told, 'I'm sorry, but these are our packages and prices and there's nothing we can do". He suggested that I "misunderstood". I find it difficult to accept that I "misunderstood" an offer I confirmed 6 times with their very own representative. I am not being provided the agreed-upon contracted services and I am being overcharged even for the services I am receiving. The "package", as described to me since by Comcast's subsequent representatives (Ann/May/David), is one I would never have agreed to or accepted had it been offered to me at the time. Comcast and its representatives are practicing price gouging and fraud. I can't see why I should have to pay a bill that is in excess to what I was told six times and is not providing the promised, offered and agreed to contracted services. All attempts to resolve this with Comcast have proven absolutely fruitless. Update: I received a call from Richard **, Executive Support/Research Specialist, West Palm Beach Region Office of the Vice President ** approximately 2 weeks ago. After explaining my complaint with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services against Comcast, he told me he would get back to me next week and they would try to work something out to my satisfaction. No offer was made and today, I received a letter from the DOA and CS claiming they had closed my case, following correspondence from Mr. ** which consisted of false and misleading information on his part. As of 9/2/2010, continued attempts to resolve this dispute with Comcast have met with absolute refusal on their part to honor their agreement.
__label__1 This is actually a long story but to keep it short. I called and spoke to multiple staff who expressed I was never in a contract. I called because I noticed that I was paying more than usual. I wanted to discontinue service because I wasn't impressed with their customer service and the rate of the bill changed. I had only had the service for nearly a year. With the confidence of trusting their staff, I closed my account because I wasn't in a contract. Or so they said. Now that I closed the account, they are charging me a $600 dollar termination fee. Absolutely blows my mind. Not only that, but they never sent me the bill for the $600. They just threw it into collections without communicating to me at all. What exactly did you do to receive an extra $600? Because I brought everything back to them. I didn't have them do anything. They are full of it. This is excessive.My proposal: if you have access to EPB, use them. EPB doesn't charge for installation, no contract, no termination fees. Strictly a monthly bill. Comcast is a corrupt cooperation ripping people off day by day. I promise that Comcast won't just lose my business. But the business of every friend and relative I can speak with. Everyone in my city is dropping it for EPB anyway. I will never use this service ever again.
__label__1 Comcast charges me $150 for one month internet access. Claim I had used over 600 gb of data. Prior to Jan. 1, average usage was <300 gb. No behavior change in our house and they would not produce daily usage logs to support billing. Brutal customer service of no help. I will be canceling and switching to U-verse.
__label__1 After sitting on hold for almost an hour, we finally got someone.  We explained what happened.  She was told over and over that the old computer was not wifi.  We were transferred several times.  We could not get it through anyone's head that the computer was not wifi.  this literally went on for about 4 hours with no resolution.  We were then transferred (since it was after hours) to someone in India who barely spoke English.  After another 2 hours, it still wasnt resolved.  About a week later, a serviceman showed up (3 hours late on a Sunday).  He finally got it up and running.  Mind you, I run an internet business out of my home.  I ended up having to refund my customers almost $1000.00 due to Comcast's inability to take care of their customers.  And to top it off, I was billed for a Sunday call!  We returned the old modem to the office.  We are still being billed $8.95 a month for a modem that was returned.
__label__5 I signed up with a local Comcast company in Ventnor. I wanted to bundle cable and Internet. They signed me up and quoted me a price of 79.99. Over the phone they told me I would get basic cable Internet, free HBO and dvr service for this price. With the taxes, my bill is supposed to be 107.00 monthly. Now I am 2 months into this and I get a letter stating that they are going to raise my bill because the dvr service is not included in my package. So I called them and was told that I can either switch the boxes out and or pay the new price. Since I am not familiar with wiring things I asked if they could send someone to do this and the answer to that is yes but I have to pay for that as well. So my issues are... Why was the dvr system set upon installation if it was not included in the price that was quoted to me... And if I have to make the switch, why do I have to pay for the technician to come out when none of this is my error?
__label__1 August 9, 2014. I was abroad for a month. I usually do not activate my cell phone overseas due to the cost, but for emergencies this summer, I paid the fee for access. I received EIGHTEEN CALLS. Not one of them was personal. Everyone was from Comcast. But what right does Comcast have to use my cell in which I pay the minutes and an overseas fee? And what times were those calls? Isn't it against federal regulations to call at 10:49 or 10:50 PM? Or worse yet, one call was at 12:47 AM and another at 2:26AM!Upon returning, the saga continued. I was tired and jet lagged. I turned on the TV to relax for a second before sleeping only to find the usual annoyance from Comcast. My television and cable had been shut off. This is the second time this has happened in a year. This time the issue is over a $123.01 check that instead of sending to the billing center, I sent to David Cohen to get his attention in May. Previously, I had mailed letters to the CEO which were ignored so I tried a different person in the hierarchy. But the negative corporate culture continued. The check has been misplaced, I guess, because I keep getting billed for it plus late fees. If Comcast wants to pay the $35 stop check fee, I will issue a new check. Since that payment, I have paid for the next two billing cycles minus the late fees - nothing is late. However, in order to restore my internet which I needed for work the next day after the trip, I had no choice, exhausted or not, I had to call Comcast and pay $33 plus to have my equipment restored. I was too tired to argue but I intend to deduct it from the next bill. I didn't owe Comcast 33 cents even.I explained this continued aggravation with Comcast with my family upon my return and they shared with me the massive amounts of customer service Youtubes I could view dealing with Comcast. Apparently, the lack of customer service has become the hottest corporate malfunction of the country. Comcast - the company that can't seem to do anything right. I wouldn't use the language some have in their complaints but I certainly understand the frustration, the embarrassment, the time wasted by clients, the unresponsiveness of Comcast, etc.Can't one month pass without having to complain? Now I await the new wireless. I am not allowed to set an appointment for install until it arrives. By that time, they will tell me every convenient time is already booked. Oh my gosh, this is definitely why the FTC should not allow any merger. It speaks to why all those many years ago anti-monopolistic regulations were passed by a responsive Congress and President.
__label__1 I'm convinced Comcast is throttling my internet signal. We've had issues with connectivity for 4 months now. Nearly every night between 8:30 and 10:30 our speeds slow down to a crawl. During that time it's so bad that we can't even load any websites at all. There have been three tech visits. The first tech said the signal was too strong. He installed a splitter behind the modem. The problem continued. The second tech did absolutely nothing.The third tech was here for over two hours. He connected his laptop to our modem and using some kind of diagnostic program, he monitored the signal for about an hour and a half. He could clearly see there was an issue with the signal, lots of spikes where there should have been none, but he couldn't fix the issue and would escalate it to the next tier.Two weeks later our problems still continued and I hadn't heard one word from Comcast. So, I called again, explained the situation all over again for about the 5th time and they once again set up an appointment for a tech to come out. The day the tech was supposed to come (Oct. 2nd) I received a call from him that afternoon. It was the same tech who had been here for two hours a couple weeks earlier. He said they had received a complaint from another customer who is in our 'node' who has been having the same issues with their internet signal. He also said he had continued to monitor our situation and continued to see the problems with the signal.He asked if it would be okay for another tech to come later in the evening, hopefully during the time frame when we have the problem (8:30-10:30) so that tech could see it for himself. I agreed. Within a half hour after agreeing to the later appointment, the tech who was supposed to come that evening called and said they now had two other customers within our 'node' who are having the same issues. He wasn't going to come to the house after-all. Instead, he and the other tech were going to be monitoring the signal and he asked me to call him if/when the problem occurs so they would be able to pin-point it.At some point that evening the internet stopped working. I called the number given to me by the tech and told him it was happening right at that moment. That was Oct. 2nd and I never heard another word from Comcast. Our problems persisted. Last week I received a letter in the mail asking if I was satisfied with the work completed on October 6th. First of all, I have no knowledge of any work done on October 6th and second of all, our internet continues to be unusable nearly every evening between 8:30 - 10:30... sometimes earlier... sometimes later. I called the phone number that was provided with the letter. The person I reached on the other end had no idea what I was talking about... no record whatsoever of this nightmare we have been going through with this God-awful company! She promised to escalate our problem. Oh gee...thanks.Tonight I received a call from some other tech who had no idea at all what has been going on these last four months. I'm afraid I lost it when he asked me to describe the problems we've been having. If there were any other internet service providers in my area I would drop Comcast in a second. But unfortunately, they're the only game in town. What on earth does one have to do to get this company to fix my service so that I can actually use what I'm paying my hard-earned money for? I am at my wit's end!
__label__0 That worked for 2 days, then the internet connection went out again. I called them back and they sent a tech out the next day. He took some measurements of signal strength and decided that the signal is too weak. Recommended another service date to install a signal booster. They scheduled an appointment 2 days later between 1-4 pm. I called back 2 times during that period to check on their progress. Each time I was reassured that they were coming as scheduled. Then at 4:45 I got a call from the tech saying that they are running on time and should be there between 5-8pm. They couldn't explain why I was told otherwise. To make it worse, they said they'd fix the cable signal strength (nothing is wrong with the cable signal strength), but would not boost the internet signal.
__label__1 My internet, cable and phone service all went out. When the technician came out, my outside line had been cut. He said they had been in my neighborhood installing new lines and for some reason forgot to connect me to a new line after it was cut. They left the exposed cable across my yard and said it would be at least 6 weeks before they would be back to bury it. I asked, "Why so long?" and their response was that they had other jobs to fulfill. I asked why I would have to wait since it was their error and they had no reason other than "that is the way it is." Needless to say, I changed companies and am saving $102 a month for the same services! What a rip-off and poor customer service. It always pays to compare. I definitely learned something.
__label__5 Great service.. Rarely down. Great speed options.
__label__0 My service was disconnected without notice on 6/23/10. I am the manager of this community and I am supposed to receive a discount of which I have never had after numerous requests. I made a payment for 2 months on June 4th. When I called today, an incompetent rep told me there was no payment made. When I called back, they then said the routing number they input was incorrect so it was not posted. No courtesy letter or phone call was made. I made a payment today 6/23/10 approx. 10:00am which cleared immediately by debit card. I still have no phone or digital cable service and it is 12:41 pm. This was totally uncalled for.
__label__1 The more Comcast proclaims to put the customer first the more hollow it is. We researched ISPs in our area and decided to go with Comcast. They tried their best to hook us into their bundled service which is such a good deal, for a year, then it becomes a new car payment forever. They couldn't activate it for over a week later and wouldn't give us a time window. The day came and went and no call, no email, no internet. Now we had to wait 3 more days. Again no time window. I know why they are so expensive. So they can run all those commercials trying to convince us that all of our experiences over the years of disappointments over appointments has change. Well headline: IT HASN'T.
__label__1 We move out of our house in 3 weeks. The buyers of our house set up Comcast service three weeks before they own the house. Comcast discontinued our service, the current owners, because the buyers set up their service. How could we, the owners, with an active account, be cut off when our account was paid and nobody contacted us about disconnecting our service? The buyers gave the settlement date, which is three weeks from now. Comcast made a big mistake. We spent hours on the phone and online chat room to resolve this issue.
__label__1 Why isn't there a zero rating? I will never get Comcast again. No matter how good their HD TV or internet may be, I won't give them a dime. First of all, their phone representatives don't understand English. How many times do I have to say, "I already logged on to my Comcast website account?" Maybe they don't know how to listen. All they can do is just repeat what's in front of them on the paper. Secondly, not only do they not listen, but they don't understand the gist of the problem even when you explain it to them. Why is it so hard to understand the meaning of "duration of the call", "how long the phone call was"? What other way is there to say it?Lastly and most importantly, they are nothing but a bunch of gangsters! Do you know they hang up on you if you give them a bad review or you argued with them previously? Yes, they hung up on me 4 times in a row, and the 4th time, I even made sure, before I even speak, that they have my cell phone number if "supposedly" we get disconnected. Do you know what happened the 4th time? After waiting for 15 minutes for the supervisor, the phone representatives said, "Now I'm transferring you to the supervisor," and then I waited there for another 5 minutes for nothing, just music playing, never answered.After repeated "please wait a minute or two," the phone rep finally said the supervisor is free so she's transferring me, and supervisor just put me on hold. Do you get it? They are all ganging up on the customer who gave a "one star" review. Wow! I heard from my friends they don't like Comcast and I didn't get it at the time. This is why. You corporate fat **, you will pay for this someday and I will watch your downfall and clap all the way.
__label__1 April of 2015 I ordered comcast internet. I was told I could hook up the modem myself and be charged 9.95. If they had to send out a tech they would charge me 39.99 (no charge if it's no fault of my own). Well, guess what? I could not get the modem to work. Comcast sent a tech to my home. The tech told me it would never have worked because comcast sent me a modem for the wrong region. He went back to his truck and switched modems and it worked. I called customer service and explained what happened. The gentleman told me someone would get back to me through an email. Week and a half no word.I called comcast back and spoke with a woman and explained my situation again. She said she seen the notes and asked if I could hold while she consulted a supervisor. I waited on the phone 45 minutes and someone came on the phone asking for all the information again. I told her I was on hold and that someone was helping me. She said they transferred me to her (the payment center). Again I had to explained all the information. By this point I have been on the phone an hour and a half trying to get my bill straightened out. Now, this woman transfers me once again. This time I asked for a supervisor so I don't keep getting pushed off on someone else. I explained what the tech had said about the modem. She said comcast didn't have modems for different region. Comcast can come get their stuff. Very poor customer service.
__label__1 Be careful when responding to direct mail or internet offers to join Comcast Xfinity. I responded to a piece of direct mail offering a 200 dollar visa card and all sorts of perks, including free HBO for two years, etc. Here I am four months into being a customer, no gift card and had to argue to get the HBO and they would only put me on a 6 month offer. They cannot locate my introductory offer stipulations, even though I have the offer right in front of me. Numerous calls to their customer service department proved futile with inexperienced reps ringing their hands, not knowing what to say or how to fix the problem. One thing is for sure, if they don't know what they're offering and seem to be baiting and switching once you join, GET EVERYTHING in writing before you agree to switch from your current cable/internet company.. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!
__label__1 I had previously left Comcast in December of 2012. After many years as a Customer, I could no longer tolerate the long wait either on the phone or at the store. There were many billing errors, order errors and service errors, each requiring a lengthy investment of time to correct. I decided to give Comcast a second chance last month. It did not begin well. I had ordered a cablecard, but it was not put on the truck. When I asked to cancel the cablecard order, the installer told me that dispatch had cancelled the entire order. After several phone calls, the installation proceeded, but took approximately three hours. After installation, I noticed that a very nice feature I had with Uverse was not available on Comcast: the ability to have Spanish CC with English audio. I called. The tech stated that the box I had did not have this capability but would send me one that did with no shipment fee.A week later nothing had arrived. I called tech support again. The representative found nothing in the notes that a new box was sent out. He suggested I go to the store in person and switch boxes. I did so. There was a very long line with only two personnel (the numbers indicated that nearly one hundred people were ahead of me). I left and returned later in the day. This time 60 people were ahead of me but there were four stations so I waited. The representative provided me with a DVR which he thought should provide the Spanish CC. It did not. I called tech support again. They indicated that the issue was not the cable box but the television itself (which is doubtful, because I had the same settings with Uverse and was able to get Spanish CC through its cable box). I called the television manufacturer who referred me back to the cable company. Three calls with three different answers and no resolution to the problem. I have given up on this issue, but encountered another technical problem. The volume control will not control the cable box volume only the television volume. One of my televisions cannot be synched with Comcast remote meaning I have to use two remotes. With Uverse at least I could control the cable box volume not a perfect solution but I could get by. Still no resolution to this problem. At this point, I decided to cancel. I had earlier found out that TMC was not subscribed, despite the original sales representation that it was. The customer solutions person convinced me to stay with Comcast through some promotional offers and subscribing me to TMC. Despite the fact that I had already made five calls to Comcast with NO issues resolved, plus two trips to the store, I stayed with Comcast. One of the promotions included an upgrade of the internet service. This required an additional phone call to reset the modem.At this point, I had made SIX calls to Comcast (a minimum of 45 minutes with numerous transfers) and two trips to the store. Yesterday, I returned to the store to return two devices that I was no longer using and to review my bill which was higher (excluding taxes) than the sales representative had promised. Again, the numbers indicated 80 individuals ahead of me with two stations. I could not wait and returned at the end of the day. This time there were approximately fifty numbers ahead of me but I decided to wait. After an hour, I was called. The representative received the two devices but could not explain the price differential and would not do anything about it. When I returned home, I called Customers solution. The call, including transfers, lasted 70 minutes. Once again the representative convinced me to stay. She told me that she adjusted my bill, and that it would be reflected in the next billing cycle. I asked what to do with the current bill and she advised me to pay the full amount and that any overage would be reflected as a credit in the next cycle. I was uncomfortable with this, as I think it is unfair to overpay, even with the promise of a credit. However, that same night after the call, I noticed that two devices were deactivated each a parallel to the ones I had returned earlier in the day. Apparently, the individual deactivated the wrong devices. At this point, I have made at least seven lengthy calls to Comcast, an unnecessarily complicated installation which failed to provide the equipment requested, four trips to the Comcast store, technical issues still unresolved, and an erroneous bill on my account, and two devices mistakenly deactivated. This is unacceptable.
__label__0 I was told by Comcast when the Digital conversion was made that their customers did not need to worry because "..,they had us covered.". Now I am being told that I need to buy converters to wartch their service. This is not only on the analog Tv's I have, but also the new TV I bought my son in Febuary is not getting the channels he did before, this is a brand new RCA HD TV. Can they legally make me buy these devices when they told us before "that we didn't need to do anything." ?
__label__1 I had a self installation kit sent to my place 3 days ago and installed and then called the customer care for activating the service. After trying out many times and through multiple agents, they could not do it over the phone and recommended to send a technician. Again messed up setting an appointment date which is inconvenient for me and after having no output via the call, was told that they'd escalate the issue and call me back today morning which am still waiting on. This means am basically without internet at my place for at least a week and God knows when I'll get a response.
__label__1 I'm trying to think of another company that offers such a superior product yet has no regard for customer service and I'm speechless. I'm a tech guy so cutting the cord was easy but the problem was that I love fast internet and great TV. There's not enough time to share all my bad experiences and everyone has plenty of Comcast service nightmare stories. I'm just not willing to pay a company that doesn't care when they waste my time on the phone. Jacking with my bill to see if and when I will catch it? I'm done!! 
__label__0 I just got services with Comcast. I work and go to school. I can't go to the store or even call them. I got my bill and they wanted me to pay for a reconnection fee, two services fee and one for an additional TV line. The tech came to my home place. The cable all around my apartment (where my kids were playing and got hurt) because the tech didn't install it right! I tried to contact them and I have to go to the office for them to even look at my bill. I told the CSR on the live chat that I'll make my payment when my bill gets fixed. Why have the 24 hours support if they can't even answer questions and tell you to go to the office?
__label__1 I downgraded my TV/ internet package to be able to pay the same amount that I had been paying the previous 6 months (they raise the price by about $20.00 every 6 months). The package "Digital Starter" included HBO - except that the HBO appears only on the main TV and not on the second TV in the house. I spoke with Customer Solutions a second time and this time they informed me that for HBO (part of the package) to appear on the second TV, I have to get a different box that costs $10.00/month. They proceeded to tell me, using all kinds of double talk, about packages with different names, different benefits, different temporary costs, different speeds. There is nothing credible about Comcast and never anyone in the know to talk to. They are a despicable company and really need to be replaced with a responsible, reputable and customer service oriented company. For seniors, they are the WORST.
__label__0 Why does the service shut off and then eventually come back on? This has been going on for weeks. I haven't watched a complete TV program. I have noticed it more frequently since the digital change over. Whats going on? Whenever/if I call the techs, they want to send somebody out and then want to charge me for it. Then, if that's not enough, if you go through the same process again, next week you get tagged again for the charges. Why? When can I get a break and get something for my having to put up with this kind of service? Damn, I nearly have to rent any movies if I want to see the complete show. You miss bits and pieces of a program and you can understand whats going on. When are you going to resolve the problems?
__label__0    Each complaint is nearly identical.  Comcast, DirectTV and Dish Network have been my research so far. (My own personal struggle has been with Comcast.) I've read each of their sneaky little "customer agreements".  I've decided to forego television entirely.  Internet/books/movies can be my at home entertainment.  Solving specific individual complaints cannot solve a thing. Their terms of agreement should be loud and clear, not fuzzy grayed and tiny print. They don't have to be fair or reasonable if they wrote it in tiny print. The contract is for their protection (as if they need it), and not ours.  We have no protection. The most we can do is set into law that they must make their terms OBVIOUS to the consumer BEFORE the product is purchased.  The problem with that is that NOONE WHO READ THEIR AGREEMENT WOULD ACTUALLY PURCHASE THEIR PRODUCT.  Write to congressmen. By purchasing cable/satellite, I'm only purchasing a bunch of stupid channels advertising the topsy-turvey tomato and the Sham-wow anyway.  
__label__1 Last month in April, I called Comcast due to a problem with the router and internet connection. After troubleshooting the problem, Customer Support offered me a promotion package for higher internet speed and basic cable for $34.99 per month, plus $7 for the router rental, so the total came to $41.99 per month and was $5 cheaper than the $47 I was already paying for just internet. The $50 for the service/cable installation was waived. So, I agreed to the promotion because it was not costing me anything and I was also saving $5 a month. I also asked to be notified 30 days prior to the promotion ending so I would not be charged a higher rate. I paid the pro-rated amount of $38.34 on 4/08/13 and had a zero balance. I have paperless billing so on 5/20/13 I signed into Comcast to view and pay my bill and was shocked when the balance owed was $133. I called Comcast and was told that $50 was for the cable installation and the rest was for cable and internet. The supervisor I spoke with is named Angel ID **. He was rude and could not explain to me why the installation charge was added a month later. He argued with me and said the installation was not waived and my monthly rate was higher $47 and not $41.99. He refused to give me the address to their head office so I could file a complaint and the phone number he gave me 1-503-617-1248 is no good. This is not the first time I had a problem with Comcast billing. When I fist signed up with Comcast in August 2012, they tried to give me a promotional package and I refused and explained the disaster I just had had with Verizon's package. I made it clear I did not want a package, only basic internet where I can watch shows on my laptop. I was given a price of $56 per month, and agreed. In February, I went into our local Comcast office to pay my bill and was told I owed $164 due to my promotion ending 2 months prior and I owed $85 per month for internet.I almost canceled my service but my son said, "See if they have a lower internet speed," and of course they did, for $47 per month. Not only was I put in a promotion when I did not want one, but I was also charged a higher internet speed than was necessary. It seems that consumers are at the mercy of Cable companies. Comcast does as it pleases; it promises promotions at a low price and then 30 days later, adds new charges so they can get more money out of a person. I know I am not the only one who has problems with Comcast. Their billing is unethical; charges that are agreed upon should not be raised at a later date.
__label__0 As I sit here waiting for a supervisor to get expedited service, I'm using my cell phone, of course, at my cost. I've been watching my modem reset every 5 minutes or so for the past hour, rendering internet access and home phone service virtually nonexistent. Yes, I made the mistake of getting all 3 services from Comcast. My telephone constantly drops calls, so my home phone service - a vital necessity - doesn't work. Last Friday, on a business call, it dropped 4 times in 1/2 hour. About 2 weeks ago, a service call was scheduled, but no one showed. I learned that if you're not home to take a recorded pre-service call the night before, the service call is cancelled. It's now been 15 minutes on my cell, and no supervisor has answered. As of now, my service is set for Friday morning - that's 2 1/2 days with a modem that resets every few minutes and no consistent phone service. This is what you have to look forward to with Comcast. 
__label__1 For no known reason, my internet went out on 10/23/2016 - it had been working very well since roughly 7/4/2016, which is shortly after I moved to a new apartment. The afternoon of 10/23, I was catching up with my friends on social media when the page failed to load and there was a message that said it would not load/could not be accessed. First I checked my Wifi links to my laptop and discovered that the Xfinity Wifi (an unsecured network) was active rather than my Home Base (a secured network); then I called the automated line to try to get my modem reset; finally, after waiting ages for the reset, the automated system transferred me over to the tech support line - something I had NOT requested. The rep was very rude and insensitive; first he laughed at me, then he cold-transferred me to another line. If I did not live in a historic building, I would have switched internet/cable providers LONG ago! And the cost! It's criminal. There's got to be a better way to get internet and cable TV - there's got to be a company that cares about its customers, treats them like human beings, and doesn't rob them blind. I feel like I'm stuck in a toxic relationship and can't escape.
__label__1 Comcast Xfinity - They unethically mis-sell me their Voice service saying that it will cover the international calling as well. When I receive my bill I was charged 200 USD more...charged for the calls I made along with few more hidden charges. When I called their CS agent, they accepted the mistake at their end but didn't reverted the unfair charges. I told them how cheated I am feeling at that time, but they didn't bother. I have never seen such a pathetic Customer service from any company. They have robbed my money, accepted it and decided not to give it back. If I'll not make the payment they'll submit the case the collection which will impact my Credit score. I am just wondering why nothing can be done against these thugs and why government has created such agencies one way. The consumer should also have easy and cheap access to file their complaints against such companies which can their businesses. That will enforce them to behave appropriately.
__label__1 Off to Target to buy a router/modem for my XFINITY service. Just in case anyone else was a gullible as I have been I want to let you know. When I signed up for XFINITY I asked if I could buy my own modem rather than "rent" theirs. I was told by their representative no I could not. That only theirs would work, no other kind was compatible. I am not the most techno knowledgeable person out there so I believed him. I have bought and paid for that damn thing multiple times over the years and I am pissed. When a friend was telling me about how they got a new modem at Target I was baffled. "You can do that?" So I am going to go get one, bring it home and make sure I can make it work. And then I am off to Comcast Cable to give them their damn modem and a piece of my mind (a small one, I don't have much to spare right now.) I feel bad for whoever gets me. I know it's not their personal fault but unfortunately they are going to have to hear about it. What a dirt bag lying piece of ** I dealt with. No idea who it was, I bet they don't work there anymore. So if you were lied to too, get your own modem, save money and tell them what they can do with it. Have a nice day.
__label__1 I have had numerous issues with Comcast. My internet speed occasionally slows down to a crawl. They have sent techs out to my house but they said there was no problem with my internet speed. I have tried my wife's laptop to be sure it was not my computer and it is not.They always give me the brush off. I am computer literate and have more savvy than most of their employees.
__label__1 Comcast has a terrible customer service. My wife was on phone with at least four different reps., asked for mgr and while talking was disconnected. Called back and asked for same mgr and the rep said they will call back, but never did. TERRIBLE SERVICE. I work for a utility co. myself and if we EVER TREATED OUR CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS we would be out of a job. COMCAST SMARTEN UP, will probably look for NEW INTERNET co.
__label__0 I am a very dissatisfied Comcast cable customer. I have recently discovered that for the past two years Comcast has been charging me for services that I have not been receiving. Every month, I have paid for an extra digital box when I have never had more than one box. I never requested this service and have recently found out from a helpful Comcast representative, Jarell Jones, that a technician made this error after making a routine repair. He never recorded that the non-working box was removed from my home. Subsequently, I have been charged $20.00-$23.00 a month for the past 24 months.   Obviously, I would like a refund for the months that I was charged in error by Comcast. However, when I spoke with a Comcast supervisor, he informed me that Comcast has a policy of only crediting customers back 6 months. I do not understand how this can be legal. How can Comcast take money from me for something that I never received? I was charged as result of Comcast's error, and I believe that Comcast should do the right thing and refund me all of the money that I paid for a service that I never received.  If you can help me with this situation, I would greatly appreciate it. I paid $480.00 over two years and Comcast is offering to reimburse me $149.00 for only 6 months of that time. Can this be legal? I don't see any statement of a 6 month reimbursement policy on the billing statement. Is there anything I can do?
__label__1 It is quite insulting to be told to be fair in the account, when their customer service representatives have been nothing but fair!!! In addition, 'Angry' in the rating is an understatement. I am beside myself that I was transferred over 9 times!!! I spent a total of 5.5 hours on the phone until I finally got a supervisor, who was not understanding at all, but was able to explain that it was my property management company that I needed to speak to for services. This is great info, if I would have received it from the 1st rep, not after 5 hours of being on the phone and speaking to the 9th rep. Overall, this is the worst service I have ever received; the reps don't know anything about other departments and do not follow through. They are happy to transfer as soon as they can. Certainly they do not go above and beyond. They are unwilling to help and incompetent! When I asked the supervisor what he can do for me as I just spent 5 hours over 2 days on the phone with them wasting my time and energy, the supervisor said he cannot do anything at all. Truthfully, I can't blame the individuals, only the company for not giving them the training or the tools to help potential clients. Extremely disappointed and livid about my experience with Comcast!!!
__label__1 I recently ordered Comcast ONLY because I couldn't get AT&T in my area. I order online thinking I could get a better deal but I was wrong. So I get my bill about 2 weeks later and it's $259.36!!! They charged me $112.00 just for the installation fees. I called to see what could be done about this bill and the only thing they could offer me was free movie channels for 3 months. Comcast does not care about their customers at all. All they want is your money!! They advised me that I could have did the installation myself but I NEVER received that option online. Comcast is the worst service I've EVER had!!!
__label__1 Post hurricane Sandy service interruption for a week. Comcast laid a Coaxial cable from the cable box into our apartment temporarily, indicating that main line underground/through the walls are corrupt. Root cause was never fixed by Comcast and resulted in it being cut off by apartment management 3 days back. Reason stated: Trip hazard to neighbors and violation of policy in running cables over the sidewalk.I scheduled an appointment with Comcast for yesterday, 12/20/2012 (2:00pm-6:00pm slot). I was a block away from home, when Comcast reached my home. I did tell customer care to wait for me 5 more minutes. But within 5 minutes, the technician went away. I made four calls yesterday to customer care at different intervals, only to be told that the dispatch unit will re-send the technician. At the end of the day (6:00 pm), I again called Comcast, only to be told that technician will not be coming over. I had to reschedule the appointment for today, 12/21/2012 (9:00 am-1:00 pm slot). Since I had to ** from work yesterday, I made my spouse to be at home today (she took an off day from work today).Technician arrived at 9:30 am and my spouse explained the issue. He was unwilling to do any remediation and was rude with my wife. I was able to hear all conversation over the phone. I felt helpless and sad for my wife. I asked her to speak with his supervisor so to remediate the issue. Earlier, the technicians used to call up their supervisors and seek inputs. This technician did not heed to that request and simply walked to his Comcast vehicle and drove away. This is despite my wife pleading and requesting him to provide some help in reinstating Comcast service.I am deeply saddened and angry with such deplorable and inhumane approach that Comcast has, especially to a woman at home. I strongly feel this is racial discrimination and denial of consumer rights on a paid service. I would like to explore all options to take this forward if needed legally. As a formal step, I have lodged complaint with Comcast customer care. I am not sure if Comcast will be of any help in resolving the issue immediately. The apartment management clearly mentions that it's the responsibility of cable company to provide maintenance service to its customers. It also mentions that Comcast never made any attempt to reach out to the apartment management to resolve the issue.
__label__1 The day I decided to sign up for service, I called and specifically requested a package with certain channels in it. The first person I was able to get a hold of notified me that service was not available in my area. Knowing that not to be the case, I called back and received someone who gave me a packaged cable and internet deal and requested what day I would like for installation. I specifically told them that I needed the installation to be done on a weekend because I would be going on a business trip the following week. The sales associate said that was fine and said that I was scheduled for installation on a Sunday and I verified that it was a good time. This was on a Thursday. The next morning I received a phone call to verify my installation. The lady on the phone said it was scheduled for Wednesday of the next week. I told her that I had originally scheduled it for a Sunday and that I would not be available the following Wednesday, at this point she replied with "You are mistaken sir, you scheduled it for Wednesday, would you like to keep the appointment or reschedule?" I kept the original appointment cause I was able to coordinate with my wife to be present during the installation. This is the first case of poor customer support.After the technician came and installed the cable, my wife called to notify me that several of the channels that I had originally requested were not available. I immediately called the 1-800 number and told them about the issue at which point they notified me that the package I had selected for install didn't contain the channels that I had requested and that if I wanted the channels that I would have to upgrade to a higher priced package. I reluctantly agreed to it and had the cable package upgraded in order to receive the channels. This is the second case of poor customer support.Thursday of that week my wife informed me that the package we had still did not have all of the channels that we needed, and that the free HBO and Showtime that was promised to me was not available either. I once again called customer support and let them know that if I did not receive the proper package that I would be cancelling my service. They transferred me to Customer Solutions and customer solutions was able to add the HBO and Showtime to my package as well as adjust my service once again. This was the third time Comcast was unable to provide proper support.The following Friday night I went to take my trash out and discovered that the technician who installed the cable line in the house had left a large wooden spool inside of my trash can filling it by about half. Finally infuriated with the situation I immediately called the 1-800 number, explained the situation, and was transferred over to Customer Solutions once again. An employee named Keeli, employee ID ** answered the phone. As frustrated as I was I am sure that I was probably irritated and blunt with her. As I explained the situation her attitude and demeanor relayed the appearance of not caring, and she had an incredibly poor attitude. At no point during the call did she offer an apology, a solution, or explain to me any of the information that I requested to be explained. I told her that I wanted my service cancelled, and someone sent to the house in order to pick up the equipment cause I would not be bothered taking the equipment back to Comcast considering how poorly I had been treated. I also explained that I wanted my 30-day money back guarantee. After she came back on the line I requested for verification that the money would be transferred back to me and she refused to answer the question directly instead saying "I cannot speculate how it will reflect on the bill." After further questions regarding the bill she began to raise her voice and interrupt me constantly while trying to talk over me eventually stating "I have only tried to help you but it seems like all you want to do is argue sir." Immediately after this I requested her supervisor's name, which is Shawn, and requested to speak with him. At this point she informed me that he had left for the day and that she would place a request to have him call me back within 24 to 48 hours. This is the fourth time that Comcast failed to offer good customer support.The next day I called Comcast back and requested to speak with Customer Solutions in order to verify that the request had been submitted. I explained the situation to Customer Relations again, this time receiving someone who was sympathetic to the situation, resolved my issues with my package, and said that the request to speak with Shawn had been submitted. They also said someone would be in contact with me regarding the wooden wire spindle that had been left in my trash. At this point I reactivated my service.The next week I contacted Customer relations again, and told them that Shawn, **'s supervisor, was supposed to have contacted me within 24 to 48 hours, and we were going on day 4 with no contact. The representative stated they would resubmit the request through ** and that the supervisors had been in many meeting throughout that week. Three days later, Monday July 7th 2014, I contacted Customer Solutions again, this time telling the representative that I wanted to speak with their supervisor, they stated that the supervisor was not available and that they would instead submit a request for their supervisor to call me back as well as resubmit a request, for the third time, for **'s supervisor to call me back and that it should be within the next 24 to 48 hours.Yesterday, which was Thursday, July 10th 2014 I contacted Comcast once again and was finally able to get a hold of a supervisor in billing. The supervisor notified me that Shawn was not reachable, and offered me discounted packages which included DVR and home phone (both of which I have absolutely no use for). I told the supervisor that Direct TV was offering me a package that included internet, Television with more channels, and NFL Red Zone for the upcoming season for $79. The supervisor attempted to see if he could find a comparable package that included NFL Red Zone and was unsuccessful. He informed me that he needed to do more research, and that he would call me back in approximately 25 minutes. I laughed at this and told him I didn't believe him. He assured me that he would be calling back within that time at which point he would discuss it with me further. I have never heard back from him.
__label__1 I received a call from Comcast last week stating that my 12 month subscription was about to expire, and offering me a new promotional 12 month subscription. I asked if I could have some time to think over the offer, and was told that I needed to make a decision immediately. The offer was decent, and not too much more expensive, so thinking I didn't have many other options, I agreed. I was thinking about the whole thing a couple of days later and realized that it didn't seem like it had been 12 months since I had gotten Comcast. I looked into it and it had only been 8 months.I called Comcast and after being transferred to 3 different people got to someone who could "help". I asked if I could finish out the remainder of my previous subscription and was told that since I had agreed to the new one, I couldn't go back. I explained again that the sales rep had misspoken when she said my subscription was expiring (which was the only reason I agreed to switch), and that I'd like to finish out my previous subscription. I was told that I should be happy with the new subscription that I was getting, as it offered me more cable options (note: I was an internet only customer, so the cable was not important to me, it just happened to be part of the bundle). I was basically told "too little, too late" (not in those exact words, but the tone was less than polite). I then asked to cancel my service, which was surprisingly met with a response of "Okay, as of when do you want to cancel?" I told her I wanted to cancel immediately, and she said that wouldn't be a problem.I feel as though Comcast was less than honest in their dealings with me, and also less than courteous/polite. I was shocked at how willing they were to lose a customer, especially with how they've been promising to improve their customer relations. I have had nothing but bad experiences with Comcast and will not be a customer of theirs again in the near future.
__label__0  i called back and let my husband call and spoke to someone in english. they fixed the problem in 5 minutes and it wqs real simple. this is not the first time with them. they hire people that dont know what they are doing. after all of this they only gave me a 5.00 credit on my bill.
__label__0 I went on line to order Comcast Cable and High speed Internet for my new house. I was prompted to list the city where I live. The order was accepted. I called the next day to confirm. I was told Comcast does not provide service in my area. The modem arrived two days later. My credit card was charged $89.99 for a modem that I cannot use and a service that I cannot have. I have been trying to return this modem for over 2 months. Noone at Comcast or Broadband would help me get my money back. Tomorrow, I will take the modem that is still its box to the post office and pay for retuning it back to the address that came from. I am hoping that someone in Broadband office in Georgia will come to relize that they charged me for something I cannot utilize because Comcast failed to notify me that they do not provide service in my area. I would like someone to contact me with an advice how I should proceed in this matter.  I am still out the $89.99 that I paid for the modem. I need my money back!
__label__5 I'm a new customer, and I have yet to be connected for service. Upon signing up, COMCAST never told me about any delays with installs, and that I would be subjected to wait almost (3) weeks for my service to be connected. It took (3) separate calls to COMCAST customer service for a rep to finally tell me about my actual scheduled service connection date. I asked for a phone number to the local COMCAST service installer who receives the work orders for my area in an attempt to possibly change the scheduled appointment date. I was given a number to call. I tried calling the number, and no luck, could not get through. So, I called COMCAST "customer service" back, and received another number. It was also bad. Both had voice messages stating this number is not receiving calls at this time. Comcast service is poor!! This is what happens when a company gets too big! The service goes downhill!! The greedy owners need to stop their shady business practices - and fire their CEO!
__label__0 For almost 2 years, I have had trouble with my internet connection... they would send someone out and for a week or so it would seem ok and then it would go out again sometimes for days... I would call again and have to start from scratch. I finally switched to AT&T... I asked Comcast to discontinue my service, but found that they were still charging me. Apparently, you get charged the full monthly amount till you turn in the modem. Comcast refused to refund any amount even though they agreed to refund my account for one month when I cancelled... so, whatever... Comcast just sucks.
__label__1 Houston has 2 internet providers - AT&T and Comcast. Both are horrendous, unreliable, and have terrible customer support. Being forced to choose one over the other makes question if we're really a democracy. I've wasted sooo much time and money trying to get decent, reliable service that if I was getting paid to wrestle with Comcast, I'd be a millionaire.
__label__0 On March 01, 2009, I had a service call by Comcast because of poor Internet service. The Comcast service tech diagnosed the problem as a faulty signal booster and removed the part. The signal booster had previously been installed by Comcast! The problem was fixed; however, Comcast billed us $24.95 for the service call to remove a faulty part they installed!. Between 3/6/09 and 4/6/09, I have placed four calls to Comcast to address this billing issue. I was told by two different customer service representatives that they would call back. To date, no one has called and I am still waiting for a $24.95 credit on my next bill.
__label__1 We had them for 6 months. Not one of the services we had worked over a week at time without problems. Customer service could not help or didn't understand problem and offered to reset boxes. Had repair out 4 times in 6 months. Finally just gave up and went with another provider.
__label__0 Cable TV service in my area has had intermittently poor picture quality on most channels for the past week. The automated phone announcement acknowledges a problem in my area. The phone idiot I spoke with insulted my intelligence with her lack of education and communication skills. She kept insisting that I check my indoor connection which, for me, is an elementary exercise that I had already done. Comcast is an arrogant monopoly that feels no obligation to give satisfactory service to paying customers. They should be taken over and regulated.
__label__1 I just had Comcast internet set up for businesses today. The installation went fine and the service is fast. I have it set up so that my customers can connect to the internet when then are smoking Hookah at my place. The issue is that when they connect to the public network they have to sign in using their comcast info. What happens if they don't have Comcast you may ask... THEY HAVE TO PAY TO USE A NETWORK I AM ALREADY PAYING FOR! They have to make an account with Comcast and then pay to use my internet! HOW CAN I PROVIDE GOOD SERVICE LIKE THAT? When I originally called to have everything set up THAT'S WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MY CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE TO PAY. But that would make me not get it so they fail to mention that little fact! COMCAST HAS THE WORST SERVICE!
__label__1 On June 22nd a payment was made to our Comcast bill via CC. The payment NEVER showed up on our account. We have called numerous times only to be on hold for an hour or more and then speak to people who barely speak English! Not to mention we were constantly told that a certain department could not handle an issue because of time or ability. Fast forward to today, 2 days later June 24th. I called Comcast and waited for 45 minutes and 32 seconds before I got the rudest and most disrespectful representative that I have ever encountered in my adult life! First I explain what is going on and she tells me that the confirmation number given to me is of no use because they don't use the confirmation numbers for anything. I asked her "what is the point of a confirmation number?" and she said "I don't know and I have already told you that there is nothing I can do with it". The conversation continues in that manner and after 10 mins she tells me she can transfer me to a Billing rep. I told her "I asked you were you one in the beginning of our conversation and you said yes." She replied "I am not and have you spoken to them already?" I said "I have spoken to just about every department and no one can seem to help me, but the money has been taken from our bank account so we just want someone who can help us." She replies "I will transfer you because you don't listen". Not only did she get rude, she hung up on me!I of course called back immediately. After waiting for 21 mins and 13 seconds I got **. She seemed to be more pleasant, but when I explained my situation and what just happened and asked for a supervisor she put me on hold for another 3 mins and 45 seconds (my phone has a timer) and then hung up on me. I still have not been helped and obviously no one at Comcast cares because they know they are the only provider right now in my neighborhood. This is very unfortunate and poor customer service. And I will do everything I can to get Verizon or whoever to provide service to our area!
__label__0 Sales reps came to the door and I spent an hour with them understanding and making sure that I would have a better deal than with Verizon. They quoted me (in writing) $65 a month. Within three months, my bill was at almost 3 times as much, over my original Verizon bill. The also did not wire my house correct either, which was an irritation but after my bill went through the roof, it really made me mad. I have had Comcast in WA for over 10 years with no problems. Here, nothing but problems. They have over 150 complaints with the Attorney Generals office here for the same type of practice. They are crooks and I don't say that often. So, I have had to change again to reduce my bill. But in the meantime, I had these horribly high bills-- just what you need in this recession. I was trying to reduce my cost.
__label__0 This is a copy of the email I sent to Comcast - using their email form."Upon agreement between myself and the customer representative that there was something wrong with the recording/playback part of the, We set up an appointment for today (Wed - 21 July) to replace the cable box. The tech brought a cable box that was rather beat up and an older model than the one I already have and he suggested I would be better off going to the walk-in station in North Scituate and getting one myself. He didn't offer to come back tomorrow with at least a matching cable box or better than the one being replaced.When I called Comcast after the tech left to explain that I was not satisfied with the way this was being handled, I was told that my service call had been listed as 'Canceled. ' I then asked if I could at least call the walk-in facility in North Scituate to be sure they had a unit available, she said that she couldn't give out that number (and that even she couldn't call this Comcast facility - it was against the rules).Is this the kind of treatment a customer should expect for the $150+ I pay every month for the three services I subscribe to from Comcast.? "
__label__0 I am tired of Comcast. I work from home as an independent contractor and usually work between 11pm and 3am. Six times in a row now my phone has went dead and my internet connection dropped in the middle of my shift. I called comcast today and they told me it was due to service maintenance and would occur on a regular basis - normally late at night (during my work shift). This is unacceptable to me! I have used other internet and phone service providers who have NEVER caused any service interruptions due to maintenance. They either need to lower my payments for my service or figure out how other companies do their maintenance without causing these interruptions! It's not like the service goes down for only 10 minutes - it takes hours!Since this is occurring during my work hours, it is causing me to lose money and also causing my managers to think of me as being unreliable. If it happens again, I may just be out of a job and who needs that right now during this recession?
__label__1 Started in July 2014 SoAoo code no signal, then went to Internet line problem went through 7 modems. Rewired the whole house TV & internet, lasted about 1 hour. Service man said wiring okay, nothing wrong. Same problems, had to disconnect & reconnect line coming into house. Tech man Corey came out and said outside line needs to be replaced. That was Aug 2014. No one came out or called. Got a tech to come out & check line. Said it was one of their oldest lines installed. Removed old crimp on fittings, put on compression fitting. Lasted 7 days. Back to square one PROBLEMS: no internet, no phone, another tech to come out on 12-15-14. I'm paying 108.00 monthly. WHY?
__label__1 Comcast was working across the street from our home and all our services (phone, internet, TV) were disconnected. It is five days later, and still no service. After multiple phone conversations, and multiple lies, I can only say they have no integrity. They have transferred me, disconnected me, were a no show for an appt, and placed the blame on me. They said I reported that only my cable TV was out, not true, and that is not a priority for them. When it asked to speak to a supervisor, I was placed on hold for 57 minutes. I am done with Comcast. This is clearly the WORST customer service I have ever encountered.
__label__5 Quality is erratic, and the internet is often down. Technicians keep coming out and temporarily fix the problem. Poor service. Technicians come out regularly to fix issues. One technician told us that Comcast had installed indoor cable outside the house. Although the service is erratic, the price is 205 less than Verizon. 80% of the time there is no problem. But at once a week, the internet connection is poor and we must call Comcast or reboot the modem. Stay away from this provider if you can.
__label__1 I've had Comcast for over a year and my internet has gone down several times. I find myself calling their technical support at least 3 times a week because my internet connection doesn't work. From paying $50 a month it's gone up to 100 a month and I only get my internet working for less that half the time. Plus yesterday one of their agents shared my personal information with a family member that's not in my account. Which I believe is illegal. I'm the only person on this account but they thought it was ok to share my information with another person.
__label__1 Today is Thursday, October 20th. I have not had internet since sometime Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, it was shutting on and off all day long, making it virtually useless. On Sunday, we called and we're told that we were one of the seven modems down. The lady was very nice and did all she could to help. Monday, we called again because it was still down. The lady was extremely rude and obviously hates her job. A request was put in for a tech to come out between 2 and 5PM on Wednesday. I sat all day yesterday waiting for someone to show up. Nothing, so I called. "Oh no ma'am, you were scheduled for an exterior cable inspection which was completed". Lies! I was home all day, no one came. It is now Thursday and I am still without internet!
__label__0 My service with Comcast is absolutely horrific.  The picture keeps going off and on.  It does not happen on all of the stations just some of them.  My TV is less than two years old and I thought I would have really good TV.  Well it isn't the TV it is the cable.  I have tried to contact [the] company and all I get is enter number so and so and after twenty minutes of all of this garbage I finally get a real person and then I end up getting disconnected.  I have been trying for a month to talk to SOMEONE - ANYONE and get nowhere.  I am really fed up with my comcast service.  I have the internet and it is so difficult to use I went back to AOL.  I pay for comcast internet but I SURE DO NOT USE IT.  I just feel totally ripped off my COMCAST. 
__label__1 I have Comcast preferred service, basic plus. With tax, it is about $36.00. Every few months, they raised the bill and it goes by zip code. I do not think that is fair, as I am on unemployment, work about 22 hours, and give over 20 hours a week in volunteer work to a homeless shelter, food pantry, and hospital. I also run clothes drives, and distribute them to the organizations, I am involved with plus towels and blankets for animals at the SPCA shelters, and books and magazines for various locations.So, my income is not going up. I tried to give as much time and energy to charities, yet they give me a hard time on each call, and now going to $49.99 for the same service by April. If I want to decrease my package, it is $29.99. The children I assist can not see what they want, and I do not want them watching adult shows. Can someone please help me.
__label__0 I have had comcast cable for years for tv, it has been ok.  I used to have Roadrunner cable (which was great), until Comcast bought them out.  Then immediately, they capped the bandwidth down to almost nothing.  They slowly have been bringing back up to an acceptable level.  However...they are so misleading and dishonest.  I pay extra for their higher tier internet service.  Do I get? Of course not!  They recently upped their internet bandwidth to 16 Megs downstream and 2 megs upstream.  Do I get that? Ha!  They tell you to go to Speak-ezy and do a speed test, but what they don't tell you is, that speed test is worthless, since they have this misleading thing called speedboost.  What speedboost does it DOUBBLES your bandwidth for a few seconds, then it adjusts to what you are really getting. I have NEVER gotten what they promised.  I have had techs out almost once a week, and they tell is it's acceptable.  I said to the one that was out today, I'm only getting 8 megs, i'm paying for the 16 meg service.  He actually told me, well 8 megs is acceptable, i'd be very happy with that.  AT which point I said, I'm paying for 16 megs and I was told I'd get 16 meg service!  Again he said, well we say UP TO 16 megs.  So they can give you 2 meg service, (which is what i was getting last night), and they are still within their legal rights.  There is NO WAY they can give 16 megs service to those houses.  They can't even give 8 meg service...they have to take the two leads and split them several times to give service period.They talked me into their stupid digital phone service. So I finally took the bate after being hounded to death.  ONly a few days after I accepted it, the power went out, and we lost all services.  Why?  because they didn't have a backup generator on our node.  Now my phone service is not $33 a month as they advertised, but now it's $36 a month, because again fail to tell you they have to charge you for a modem fee too.  I had already bought and was using my modem for my cable tv and internet.  So now to get my internet speed back up, they have to come and put my modem back in for the internet and leave their modem for the phones and tv.  Well it means again, loss of signal because they have to split the signal from their modem to mine.  I can't wait until Fibreoptics are in here, i'll be gone like the wind.
__label__0 Poor quality. Inability to provide service paid for. Difficult to communicate problems through voicemail "Hell" 800 numbers. They asked us to take off work to get service a week later. Unable to meet consumers basic needs for service paid for. Lost entertainment time paid for. Lost time and effort trying to get problems corrected. Lost competition for services due to monopoly standard.
__label__1 I have had Comcast Triple Play for many years and have enjoyed it tremendously. I love the cable package I have and my Internet speed is very good. I recommended Comcast to friends and family over the years. Until now. On Friday my phone went dead and my modem lights continuously flashed. Cable and Internet were fine. But no dial tone. I called Comcast and spoke to India. The agent recognized that my modem was broken and put in a request to have a new modem sent to me. He said the phone showed "active" on his end so he deduced it was a modem issue. He did not say anything about dispatching a tech. He restarted my old modem 3 times in an effort to give me dial tone, but to no avail.I called the next day to request a tech be dispatched with a new modem. I was speaking to India again. This agent restarted my modem at least 4 times (I think they must get a bonus for every time they do a restart!!). He had the ticket in front of him and I stress that while the phone looked "active" to him, it was not. There was no dial tone. However, you could leave voicemails since that system resided elsewhere. He would not dispatch a tech. On Sunday I called the "repair team" whose number had been provided by the Saturday agent. They (in India or Philippines) read the ticket and insisted on restarting my modem. This time 3 times. They said the new modem was arriving on Monday and asked me to call them when it arrived.Sunday evening I received a voicemail from the repair team. My phone service was fixed! Of course, it was not. On Monday I set up a chat to say the modem had not arrived and I needed a tech. I was told a tech could be scheduled 1.5 weeks away. The "chat" tech said my ticket had been closed because the phone was fixed. And there was no record of a modem being mailed. I was almost to the point of tears. EVERY number I called led to an overseas call center who was TONE DEAF.On Tuesday I planned on going to my local Xfinity store and raising hell... when a new modem arrived. I called the repair team and got the Philippines. I could barely understand her. The accent was very thick. She insisted on restarting my modem before she scheduled a tech. And, of course, to no avail. But she opened a NEW ticket for me. Then fortunately we got cut off. I called back and made an error in my selection and miraculously got a US call center. This agent, Keisha, was fabulous and took action immediately and escalated the dispatching of a tech. I'm now waiting for dispatch to call me with the schedule.However... about 2 hours after setting things up with Keisha, I received a voicemail from the repair team that my phone was fixed. Of course it was not. I called and touch-toned the same way as before and got a US call center again! And the agent flagged the ticket "DO NOT CLOSE THIS TICKET." for fear the repair team would, again, close my ticket. What can I say. USA, USA, USA!! I am a former call center manager and director and I'm appalled at the total lack of training and lack of authority given to these outsourced agents. They are nothing short of robots. Comcast does not deserve to expand. It was right they were denied Time Warner.
__label__1 On November 29, I called Comcast to report very slow, at times no internet service. I spoke with tech named John, who was not in MN. I was on the phone for at least 30 minutes, while he attempted to reconnect service. I also asked him to record my complaint as we have had problems with service previously. He asked that I hang as he would make further efforts to fix the problem and he would call me back. No call. November 30 is my second call to Comcast. I spoke with Cricket, who said there was no record of my call the previous day. She took information and said she would schedule a tech to call me for an appointment. The tech called and her first words were, "I can tell you why you are having trouble. You have a mechanical problem, weak signal." I am no techie but could figure that out. She explained that this can be determined at their end but there is no way to contact Comcast locally, only through the call center. How brilliant for a company to combine inefficiency with lousy customer service. She scheduled an appointment for 8-10 Friday. Subsequently, we got a notice that it was for the same time, but Monday. Next is an automated phone call for a tech to come 4-6 pm Friday. Hopefully, someone will appear sometime.
__label__1 I canceled Comcast Internet service when I was moving to a new state. I received two bills after I canceled service, the last one coming 5 weeks after service was canceled. I called Comcast to ensure that it was my final bill and the Comcast rep ensured me that it indeed was my final bill. I paid that amount and thought I was done with Comcast.About two weeks later I get a letter from a collection agency stating that I owe Comcast $73 and that I must pay $157 to the agency. I never received any bill or correspondence from Comcast and when I called to talk to them, Comcast stated that I had a credit of $85. The $ doesn't really bother me, but I am in escrow on a house and this account has knocked my credit score down over 100 points and will significantly affect my mortgage rate. I had nearly an 800 credit score and this thing has knocked me down to the 660's. I'm working to get it all straightened out, but it may not get worked out in time for my closing, if at all.Comcast Internet wasn't any good in the first place, but this ordeal has been a real thorn in my side for weeks now. It has been echoed on this site often, Comcast has a monopoly and truly does not care about service or what kind of damage they do caused by their clueless reps. If you research Comcast and still go with them, I've got no sympathy for you. It's better to go without than have to deal with them. 
__label__0 Since November 07' I have had nothing but problems with my service. After about 20 phone calls in december with no luck I decided to take my box to manahawkin to exchange. I was given a new one.two weeks later my box stopped working so they sent someone out to 'fix the lines' they told me there was nothing wrong with my lines it was the box so they replaced. two wekks later my box was not working again, so they sent some one out again to 'fix the lines. they replaced to box again and checked the signals and said there was nothing wrong with lines it was the 'new box and replaced again. the again a week later someone had to come again to 'replace the box! this was in january 08, numerous amounts of phone calls and I asked them if I could be credited at least something and they said no but maybe 40.00 that is a joke considering my bill is about 100.00 a month!! now here it is march 8 and I awoke to noe cable and no internet again! I called for three hours and finally got thru and they said someone would be out from 12 to 4 today. they never came. so at 5 I called and they said no one can come until tuesday the 11th and that no one should of told me that. so when I asked for a supervisor she (camille hung up on me) so once again I called back to get a supervisor and was told now there were outages in my area,even though all my neighbors had service but me! 
__label__1 I had my service in Kennesaw GA terminated on March 25, 2015, because I was moving out of state. I mailed my equipment to Comcast using the UPS store # 1998 on Cobb Parkway. I was due a refund of $93.46 and was told it might take up to 180 days to process. I called Comcast on October 2, 2015. Rep told me it would be 4-6 wks before the check went out. On November 24, 2015, I called Comcast and spoke with a very nice representative who told me the refund had not gone out because Comcast shows I failed to return a piece of equipment and was being billed $50.00 for that. I told the rep I did return the equipment via UPS store # 1998, but I do not have my receipt because I lost it during the move. This representative opened an investigation, gave me the investigation number, and told me it would take 5-7 days for the UPS store to conduct an investigation, and then Comcast would contact me.December 8, 2015, I called Comcast because I have not heard from them. I spoke to a representative who told me the investigation was closed, and the UPS store did verify I returned the equipment. So, I am due $93.46. Once again, the check will be mailed in 4-6 weeks. If, in fact, I DO receive the refund due me in January, 2016, it will have taken the company ten months to refund my money. Comcast has held my $93.46 for 9 months now. If Comcast withholds refunds from all their customers like they have with me, there's no telling how much interest they're making on those funds. Is that the plan here, that Comcast makes even more money off people who have closed their accounts?
__label__0 I cancelled my account and was due a refund for the account. I gave my new address. I have called 6 times over the last three months, and every time, they tell me that they will cut a new check and give me a new date of two weeks. I still haven't received my money from them.I've spent over 650 minutes of my time and phone bill on them. I have yet to receive the money owed me.
__label__1 Unprofessional swindlers! I disconnected my business lines as our home business was no longer in tack. I disconnected our home landline and only wanted wifi. I was sent a contract to disconnect the lines and was unaware it would bind me to run my wifi through Comcast Business instead of Comcast Residential. I was not told of the price difference between the two and did not read the contract. My bad. I was told it was to be signed to disconnect the lines. I did not realize I was signing up for a two year contract costing me much more than if I had used only their residential service. I have contacted them three times in attempts to switch over to the residential service but they have become downright nasty in explaining I am stuck in this contract and would have to pay it off over $2000 to get out of it! Stay away from Comcast Business! There are plenty of other great service providers out there.
__label__1 Comcast is sending and threatening customers to pay bills two months in advance. This is fraud. The bill should be the amount for that month and now they are playing games with the billing statement by manipulating the pay cycle forcing millions of customers to pay twice the bill every month. Now they are harassing the customers with phone calls 2 days after their late bills arrive and had my service placed in the middle of the month (June 22, 2012) and they are saying that my bill is late and they did not tell us that they were billing this way at the beginning of the month causing or making my bills appear as though they were late and adding on the following month as if we owe that charge on this month. They are defrauding the customers by manipulating the charges. RCN has now begun to do the same thing overcharging us one month in advance when clearly when we initiate the service this is never explained and I have used Comcast since 2001!!! This is fraud and it needs to be addressed and every Comcast customer needs to look at their bill carefully because they are charging you 2 months in one and manipulating the bill cycle to appear as though you are late and what they are doing is to pressure you to pay 2 months in a month every month and they will still print on the bill that you are past due even when their bill comes late and they do not consider the day you transfer the service (which is law that they should count by the day that you actually have the service installed). Comcast billing cycle is fraudulent and they want twice the amount (over $500.00 a month). Look at your bill and look at your bank account.

He said that it should be close to 10 over 12". He said that he reported this to another division of Comcast for them to come out and fix the street signals. He said that he had no idea when they might come out since that was a different department.
At some point in time, an amplifier was placed on front on house. Various technicians who came later during weekly visits decided that the amp messed up the internet connection and/or made signals bad to inside house. Intermittent problems included no signals, weak signals ( boxes on screen), One Moment Please? on various channels, especially the higher numbers on front of house TV and intermittent weak or no signal to garage.
Around November 8, 2008, technician determined that the signal to the TV in the garage was weak due to line problems from front of house to garage. Outside contractor work order was generated for Integral Development Solutions to rewire to garage on November 11, 2008..

Courtney arrived about 3:30 p.m. He changed the drop? line from the street to the house.
He noted that entire the house needed to be rewired with one line going from the first splitter at the  to the garage without a break for the internet modem. He noted that there were way too many splitters that weakened signal from the front. He placed an order for a complete rewire and said that we would be called and he could not set the appointment. He also stated that the signal from the street pole was still 6 over 20" and that this was supposed to have been fixed by a different crew a long time ago.
Around 6:35 p.m. on November 30, 2008, I received a call from a Comcast person who said that some one was coming to the house right away tonight. I gave my telephone number and the person is supposed to come out tonight.
Around 6:50 p.m. November 26, 2008 I received a call from an Integral man who said he was coming to the house. Adrian Goodlow of Integral arrived at 7:10 and stayed until about 8:20 p.m. He looked at all of the exterior and the garage box and modem and agreed that the re-wire requested by Courtny was needed. He stated that he could start around 10 a.m. Friday November 28, 2008 and that it would take about 3 hours or so.

At some point in time, an amplifier was placed on front on house. Various technicians who came later during weekly visits decided that the amp messed up the internet connection and/or made signals bad to inside house.

I gave my telephone number and the person is supposed to come out tonight.
Around 6:50 p.m. November 26, 2008 I received a call from an Integral man who said he was coming to the house. Adrian Goodlow of Integral arrived at 7:10 and stayed until about 8:20 p.m. He looked at all of the exterior and the garage box and modem and agreed that the re-wire requested by Courtny was needed. He stated that he could start around 10 a.m. Friday November 28, 2008 and that it would take about 3 hours or so.

__label__1 I called about my internet service for the second time; it's not worked and I pay my bill. They said they'd lower the bill by $20. She asked me about Comcast TV and I said maybe in the future. I got a pack in the mail today w/ Comcast remote and box... I DID NOT say yes to that. Now I have to go to a UPS store to send back and my bill is probably screwed. Not happy at all.
__label__1 I signed up for internet and phone service. A little more than two weeks after I had had the service for a year, I called up to cancel the phone service, but was told that was not possible and that my service had been automatically renewed. I have bought phone and internet service many times from many companies, including Comcast in the past, but I have never heard of such a horrible practice. It's deceptive. No one ever said that the service would be automatically renewed. It was not spelled out in the agreement. It's also unreasonable and unethical.
__label__1 This all started back in May. I transferred my account with Comcast to my in-laws b/c I was in the middle of moving out of my apartment & purchasing a house after I had my baby 2 months early. I went to pay my bill for June & was informed that Comcast was trying to charge me for non-returned equipment even though I was told I could hold on to it until I had everything installed in my new house (I had dropped from full service to just internet while at my in-laws but only for a month before I found out about this charge). I was told if I returned the equipment I would have credit for the whole month of June & at least part of July though since I had reduced my service from a dvr, regular box & internet to just internet. So I did before the specified date, which was by July 9th I believe but definitely the first week of July. I remember because my son was born May 15th & was in the NICU for 3 weeks. I had an appointment that day for myself & no one to watch him & he had only been home about 2 weeks. I had to have a man carry my equipment in so I could manage the car seat & door at the Comcast building. I talked with my mother on the phone that day while waiting. I was on the phone with her when the lady at the front desk, who takes return equipment when the office is really busy, took mine & told me I was all set. Comcast didnt send me a bill for July at first so I called them & they told me I didnt owe them anything. I assumed from the credit I was told I would get for returning the equipment in June also. But when I called about transferring my service to my new house starting the first week of august is when all of the problems started to rise to the surface. First they couldnt get the service working at my new house (the WOW cable company later determined the issue), second they actually set up appointment for a technician to come out to my house that I never made, but I told them to just keep because of the issues. 3 separate people confirmed this appointment. The day before this appointment somehow it was (& this was never quite clear) scheduled but never confirmed & then cancelled? But never by me. They set up an appointment for that Saturday though & swore to me they would put in a ticket to the supervisor to have call & get someone out sooner because of all my problems. Saturday rolled around, no call & no technician. I call Comcast & it says on the recording they arent coming out until Sunday. The lady I spoke with flat out lied to me because I wrote down the information she gave, date, day & time. This was also fighting with them because they were trying to charge me a $50 deposit as a new customer after I had been with them for a year & never paid my bill late once & I was told that they did that if your credit score was lower. But I didnt have to pay a deposit when I got Comcast a year prior & I watch my credit score & I knew it was the same. So then they told me "well maybe the person who transferred it just didnt run it but the "retention team" removed the charge after a previous agent told me it probably wasnt possible & she would have to put in another ticket to a supervisor." So after all that, being lied to about, they say the technician is coming out after they made the appoint & cancelled, then rescheduled it. I cancelled Comcast & am told I won't owe them anything because I never got service in my new house & since they opened my case there as a new client, I had a 30 day money back/satisfaction guarantee. Then in September I get a call (mind you no bill was ever sent from Comcast) from collections for 292, while I am at Children's Hospital with my Preemie in the ER, for the cost of the equipment I returned in JULY! After spending something like 3 hours on the phone with Comcast I was assured they would track down the equipment (by yet another supervisor) & figure out what was going on. After the issue was supposed to be cleared up I called Comcast & the billing recording said they owed me $32. Then this past Saturday I get a notice in the mail from the collection agency saying I owe them $292, so I call Comcast's automated system & it says I owe them $89! I am so beside myself. I have no clue what to do. I returned my equipment. I always pay all my bills on time. The lady who took my equipment said I didnt need anything from her & I could. I specifically asked. They are jacking up my credit score, trying to defraud me, causing me emotional turmoil & distress. I am actually considering contacting a lawyer at this point because now I am being harassed by a collection agency because of them and I dont even have their equipment, they do!
__label__0    I've had comcast for a long time and would like to keep it! But getting tired of the way Woodbine customers are being treated!When HD can I kept calling about it and comcast said it's not in Woodbine yet. Now everyone around Woodbine has on deman I call Woodbine don't have it and they don't know when it will get here if ever! Woodbine is small and I guess wouldn't mean that much if comcast lost it as a customer.But please realize that people in Woodbine pay the same amount as everyone around us but we get so much less. Why dose comcast think thats fair? Why are we not kept informed on whats going on around us? 
__label__1 I am in my third year of dealing with Comcast's deceit and barely legal business practices. In 2014 I wanted to leave Comcast for its poor performance both technically and customer support. I called them and asked if there would be any contract charges to cancel my account at which time they answered no. I asked them to confirm their answer and once again was told there would be no contract charges to cancel my account. I asked for the customer service rep's name and was told Kit and only Kit although I asked for further identification.When I actually cancelled my account they informed me that there was a $90 contract charge to cancel and thus began the three year headache. I attempted to resolve this via email with no response. I attempted to resolve this via customer service only to be told my option was to resume as a Comcast customer. I asked to speak to a supervisor only to be dumped into a voice mailbox with no return call. I asked for assistance by a Comcast salesperson with the company I work for with no follow thru.I paid all charges but the $90 and let that go to collections. I wrote letters to the collection company disputing the charge only to have it keep turning up like a bad penny. I finally settled today for less than the full $90 but have little hope that they will not turn up again seeking to collect the remainder. I was informed by this collection agency that Comcast is attempting to refresh its customer service image due to all the negative press. Personally I think they have failed miserably as a company with abysmal customer service. I would go completely off grid if my only choice for service was Comcast. If you have an option choose anything other than Comcast. They are crooks, then and now.
__label__1 They promise 100 m download for their blast service. My computer NEVER got over 72 and during peak hours it dwindled down to 15 m on the speed test. They had 101 excuses for this including blaming my laptop. No credit given for service I was not getting. They do a transfer of service and move my billing cycle 2 weeks earlier. This caused a $100.00 discrepancy in my normal monthly bill. Tried to explain what happened but they cannot do simple math and justified my bill as accurate even though I was getting ripped off for 2 weeks of service for them changing the billing cycle and them charging a month in advance. FIOS is not in my area but wish it was. My mother has FIOS and it is 100X better than Comcast with 100X better customer service. Don't be another Comcast victim, get FIOS if all possible.
__label__1 I shopped online for Internet providers at my new home. I found a deal from Comcast, and called to sign up for it. I took notes because I've had problems with Comcast before. The deal was for 12MB (download speed), $30 a month for the first 6 months, $45 for the next 6 months, and $60 a month after that. There was no contract, so I could quit any time.After two weeks of intermittent service, I was billed $60 per month. This is even though my bill said I was receiving 12MB download speed. I found out I was only getting 6 MB download speed. I was pressured to pay the bill for the incorrect amount. Amanda at Comcast said she could not generate a new bill for me. She told me that I would receive 12MB download speed now, but I sincerely doubt it since no one was assigned to come to our house to make it suddenly work faster from then on.
__label__0 I have been without internet service for a week and have had unusable service for over two weeks now. With Comcast, a regular technician has to be scheduled to come out before maintenance can come out and fix any issues outside the house. Maintenance was scheduled for the 1st of October, but they never fixed the issue. I had called the support number every day to find out what was going on and they kept telling me they were working on it.Today, I called them and was told that maintenance for the repair was cancelled and they just put in their notes issue not fixed. I called the first technician and his supervisor to find out what happened and why. All I get is their voicemail immediately and still no answers to my polite messages that I have left for both of them. So now they have to call another technician so they can schedule another maintenance person to come out to fix the issue; if that ever happens. This Monopoly MUST stop! Where are you Verizon FIOS?! One thing is known: I or no one else here will not have to worry about breaking Comcast's new acceptable use policy.
__label__1 I just purchased a business three months ago. The previous owner had Comcast so I've kept it in place. Because the previous owner had set up to pay Comcast online (and I was unaware of that), I never received a statement, only late notices. Finally, the customer rep told me why I wasn't receiving the bills and set it up for me to begin receiving paper statements. I just got the first one and noticed they are charging me $4.95 a month for a cable TV hookup that I do not use and was not aware of. I asked them to take that portion off my future bills. They refused saying there was $180 charge to terminate any part of the contract before next year. Even after I explained about the billing mix up and that I have just now been privy to an actual paper statement to see what I'm paying for, she still refused. They are not business friendly at all and certainly aren't welcoming to new businesses. I will be disconnecting all the services I have with them in the near future.
__label__1 So after 20 plus yrs and many many customer service frustrations including an offer to reduce my bill which in the end actually increased my bill by 40 dollars, I called because internet been off for 2 days. First foreigner I spoke to was pleasant and could read a script well but was no help after 30 mins. Transferred me to an American who say my 2 month old sb6183 modem was at its life end and the only thing I could do is get a new Comcast modem... A tech would have to come and install it (No doubt I would pay for that service) even though when you call the first thing they do is try to get you to fix it yourself... I cannot wait until fios is in Northeast Phila.
__label__0    On 6/6/08 I receive basic cable service with comcast. Before the tech AJ came out to connect my service i ask,how much my bill would be? he responded it cost me $25.00 to come out & connect & a monthly service charge on $24.95 for basic cable. After he left and i notice the order form, he did not check the box that shows how much my montly payment is or the service i should be receiving. I then call him and he said to me he was on the phone and he will call me back when he was through, I waited but he never called back, so I check the internet for comcast and got phone#. I called and got rep. Lemeka so i told her what happen and that i wanted to know exactly how much is my montly service charge becuase it only show $24.95 for 3montly. She started by saying there is a $50.00 credit fee,$29.00 connection and my bill will be $52 plus tax & other charges, I then ask to speak with a supervisor because I was never about these charges.The only charges i am aware of was that I needed to pay $25.00 which i did when the tech came out and my montly service for basic cable is $24.95. Lemeka the rep. said her supervisor Linda G was on a conference call & so I left a message on her vmail to call me asap. I then check the website & sent an email to Rick G (SVP Customer Operation Comcast). I then call back spoke with rep. Johanna was told a diferent story, I call the third time & spoke with rep Pam. I just was to know exactly how much my montly chages for basic cable & not a set of added and unnecessary charges.I called and got rep.

__label__1 I have had Comcast service for over 7 years. It seems that most of the time when they update the system in my area they forget to make the customer service department aware of the situation. This has happened many times and it takes hours to correct if you can get to the right service agent and you are not hung up on while on hold. This past experience was really disturbing. I have a DVR in my living room but after the last update I could no longer get on demand services. After calling in and trouble shooting for over 45 mins I was told to bring the box in. I did just that and came home to have the same problem with the new box. Please keep in mind the trip to the Comcast office is a 1 hour and 20 min round trip. I stayed on the phone and on hold for another 45 mins and was told "sorry your equipment is bad, please return to store". So I made another 120 min round trip. Well wouldn't you know.... the 3rd box did the same thing! I called and stayed on hold for over an hour this time and was told someone would be calling me within the hour to have a service tech at my home that day. Two hours later I had not received a phone call so I called again, staying on hold on 20 mins this time. A service tech by the name Kiesha (hope I spelled that right) told me that no one would be coming to my home that day. There was just a request put in and if they had an opening they would call me, if there was no opening they would not call me and I would need to call in to set up an appointment. She also stated that the next available appointment was 3 days from that day and that was all she could do. I was done at this point and was just going to get another provider. So that my whole family could watch TV I took my HDTV box out of my bedroom and installed it in the living room. No luck there either!!!! I tried putting back in the bedroom and no service then!!!!! I thought to myself this is a problem on their end, not equipment, not installation, Comcast Customer Service. Well I got on the phone again after another 30 wait the phone was answered by a perfectly well spoken women name Amanda out of the Nashville branch- 6n6. Wonderful lady to deal with, listen to my dealings with Comcast and was nothing but helpful!!!! She knew exactly what was wrong and had me up and running within 10 mins. My point being that when you hire and train people who speak proper English, care about their job, and are willing to be helpful and not pass the buck, you get results. It is in my opinion that Comcast seeks out just the opposite of these requirements! The issue with my HD/DVR box was the update given by Comcast and with a click of a mouse the problem was resolved. I would also like to mention that I received my bill today and have been charged rental for a movie that I have already purchased in my library. I did call and spend only 20 mins to get these charges removed and was given no excuse why this happened. I still plan on switching services simply due to the fact that if a loyal customer for over 7 yrs that has never been late on a $240 bill a month has to spend an entire day to correct a customer service issue..... then it's really not the customer service I would like to have.
__label__1 I've had service with Comcast going back to September of 2013 and everything was working fine until late January of 2014. Started having problems with the video and audio constantly going out and they sent 6 different technicians to rectify the problem and failed. Every single one of them talked like rocket scientists saying everything's fine now you won't be having any problems and what do you know shortly after they leave I still have the same problem. On top of all that I was being charged for a modem that Comcast says it belongs to them when I never rented a modem from them because I have my own that I purchased from Bestbuy. In addition, to my service issues the wait time to talk to customer service has been an average of 20 min or longer. And when I go speak with someone it's someone that can't comprehend my needs because they're from a third world country with no concept of CUSTOMER SERVICE. I am fed up with paying my hard earned money for service that's worked less than 50% of the time. It took Comcast 5 months to realize they don't know how to resolve the issue so they said they would give me a refund. The supervisor that has been dealing with my issue said she would call me after she finds out my total refund amount and it has been over 3 weeks. I called customer service to find out the amount and it's not what the supervisor Trish had mentioned. I will never ever use COMCAST AGAIN.
__label__1 I wanted to restart a new service at a new address today. They would not allow me to do so with my old account. There is a $23.74 credit sitting on my old account. I had to open a new one. I called to see if they could help me. Instead I was met with confusion, reluctance and being passed around 4 times. I was hung up on 3 times, one time I believe was on purpose because I was telling him I was just hung up on 2 times and need someone to help me and then he hung up on me. I have never felt so angry and disappointed with a company before and now I am stuck with them for a year until my contract is up. Train your staff!!! Get rid of them if they cannot do the job!
__label__0 The service was only restored on the next Monday after being on line and on the phone for more than 1.5 hours.Tech support guys said they could not do anything about it, as it was with the billing guys.I have had an account with Timewarner for 5 years and never had such an issue, but since Tiemwarner sold it to COMCAST the problems have increased significantly.
__label__1 I ordered Comcast Cable from a very nice representative, who set me up with an appointment the next morning between 8am and 10am. I told him I had to work that day, but that my mother lives with me and would be there all day. He said that was fine. I received a courtesy call confirming the appointment and that someone over 18 had to be there.The next morning about 9am, my mother called and said that the man had come and said I had to be there or he wouldn't hook up the cable. She said he was grumbling about other jobs he had to do. I called Comcast about the trouble and what the man had said and done. All the representatives apologized, but they did nothing but either said that all the workers were busy taking care of other customers until Monday or that they would send somebody out. But nobody came. This went on from about 9am to well after 4 pm and at least 10 calls about our appointment. Customer service for your company is apparently a joke at this point. This was, without a doubt, the worst service I have ever received by any company of any kind; and if I were the executive in charge of customer service, I would not admit to it.
__label__0 I have called for several months concerning the service to my Cable Service. I thought if I scheduled to add on internet and phone, I would get special attention. My fault, it obviously doesn't mean anything to get more work because I still don't even have anyone trying to help me get someone here to figure out why I don't have any of those services! You would think someone would be backing up these service calls to see why things have not progressed? I have told the service reps what the other ones have said, but no one seems to care as they revert to a note that was put in forever ago. At least one note made it and all I want is cable to come in and that I receive and can hear it without it skipping words and going on and off! Everyone of my TVs do this so it is not just my TV, they are all different brands so that is not it. This has been going on for years. We travel a lot, and when I return from trips I don't have that kind of time to spend hours on a phone to wait for someone to pick up and make an appointment for 2 weeks out because I know I will be leaving again. So when I know I am going to be home, I make the effort and when I finally have the call I started back in Sept., the lady told me they would "refresh" my cable so I had to unplug all my lines to TVs (even the ones behind massive wall furniture, which was insane!) and they would work fine within a few hours. How easy, not!She got to hang up, only for me to have to go through the same routine of getting back on the phone, spending several hours more to finally get someone to speak with and waste another few hours to get the same response and the same requests to do. Who has this kind of time to blow? OK. And it doesn't work again, so now back on and they are going to send someone. I think adding on services will get me more attention. No such luck. Each cable guy has a different excuse of why he can't do anything, but not to worry because he will record a detailed report and the next guy will know exactly what to do. This never happens! Comcast doesn't even have what each one says nor all the different times I have called. I recorded the dates. Now I am taking down names and # of each so I have exact info. If I could have another company for cable I would in a moment, to get these guys out of my house. I hate incompetence. Please let me know if there is any or maybe not have TV at all. I am exhausted with all of this, I have another wasted day of hours on the phone only to hear I need to do it again on Friday (12/17) because they can't do today. I am telling her what the other guy said to do, but she is says it's not recorded so we will probably be repeating this on Friday. How is it that a company so large has this type of disorganization, incompetence and disregard for public service? Why should they care? There is no one to compete against, the market is theirs. They are horrible! Comcast needs a wake up call. Am I the only one that can't get through? Consequences are high blood pressure, marriage under pressure because every 3rd to 5th word doesn't come through, the picture goes on and off, we are not receiving his favorite channel (whatever Morning Joe is on). So come 5:30am, I have to listen to him screaming about how I am not hard enough on the cable people to get this simple job done! The stress of this stupid TV puts everyone in a bad mood! The time I have spent on the phone waiting, I could have made a week's pay by now. Needless to say, the days I have missed work for some joker cable guy come to tell me he can't do the job because he is not equipped and will leave detailed notes for the next guy so he will be ready and then have the next one tell me the same story. Poor service, disorganized communications, and horrific customer service.
__label__1 Comcast is the absolute worst... I make an appt to have cameras put up and upgrade my boxes. The rep made an appt for last Saturday. I got a call Saturday morning saying they couldn't make it because a tech wasn't available. I got a stupid $20 credit (which doesn't pay for the time I sat waiting) and scheduled for the following Saturday which is today. Well guess what? Got another call today after 11am saying that what... They can't make it again. This couldn't possibly mean what the new commercials are saying.They will work around our schedule not the other way around. Well for the 2nd weekend I have rearranged my schedule to accommodate them and they have for the 2nd weekend failed to meet that standard. I called 1800comcast and argued with them to let me talk to a manager. Manager finally calls me back only to transfer me to the billing dept only for them to have someone call me back again... Ugh. Maybe I should take my service and over payment on my account (they owe me money) and find somewhere that values their customers and holds their part of the bargain. Smh.
__label__0 We paid our Comcast service and 2 days after we paid, we were hit with a late fee. We have severe outages that has killed our TV and had no cable for 1 month and we were still required to pay for service they couldn't fix for over a month and had to buy a new TV as a result of their cable not being grounded. To top it all off, they're the only cable company out here. They won't allow another cable company to come out to my city. As I rent, I am forced to have Comcast if I want to watch TV! I thought that a business can not hold a monopoly on a service in CA so that people could have a choice! But not where I live.
__label__1 Comcast made plenty of promises when I called to set up service connection back in June 2014. They have delivered on NONE of their promises. From cable TV that doesn't function to poor customer service, to nonexistent customer service and a toll-free help line that is never answered without a minimum of 20 minutes on hold, their service sucks! I would not recommend Comcast to my worst enemy. They have plenty of excuses but nothing else!
__label__1 All of the negative reviews you read have common themes. Comcast was great for the first year. Increased the Price the second which was never disclosed. Increased again the third year and again when I cancelled. Every time you talk to someone they are reading a script and don't answer your question or understand what you are trying to get resolved. They answer everything with "I have a promotion for you". I never get angry but after a month of trying to resolve our problems and being lied to over and over again I lost my cool and hung up. So done. I would rather have no internet and use wifi hotspots or even our Podunk library that has 3 computers than ever sign up with this ridiculously shady company. Buyer COMPLETELY BEWARE!!!
__label__0 After a year of terrible customer service and being unemployed for a couple months, I decided to cancel my cable and internet with Comcast. I took a few hours and took all my hardware, ie. cable box and internet modem plus all the wires and remote to their office in Sugar House SLC, UT. On January 29, Friday, I wanted to have it canceled that day as I was also moving that day. I was told all services would be canceled that day. I asked specifically if I would have anything taken out of my account as I did have a balance of $7.89 and the customer service representative said no, once they cancel a subscription then they can't take the money out of an account. She told me that I had to mail in a check for the remaining balance with my account info on it.The very next Friday, February 5, $51.37 was drawn out of my account, which put my account in the negative. As I said before, I am unemployed and did not have this balance. I didn't see this until Saturday February 6th, I called immediately to have them give me my money back. The 1st lady I spoke with was very rude and unhelpful, I continued until I finally got a supervisor, which until this call I was never able to do. After talking with and arguing that Comcast made the mistake and owed me the money back she said it would normally take 4-6 weeks and that I needed to see if my bank would make some exceptions when I got some fees for bounced checks from that weekend. I called my bank and they said they would try to work with me as best of possible, however I didn't want my account to be negative, so I borrowed some money to deposit in my account. The Comcast Supervisor, Salima said she would try to get the refund expedited on Monday and would call me back on Tuesday.I called on Tuesday and she was not in the office so I left her message. I called again on Wednesday, February 10 and still only got a voice mail. I finally received a call from her and she told me that they couldn't refund my money and I had to go through my bank to get the money back. It had something to do with EFT and ACH or some financing terms. I called my bank again and spoke with the branch manager and he said that since it came right from my checking account, the bank couldn't get the money back from Comcast. Around and around it goes, I called the Comcast Supervisor back and again got voice mail, left a message and told her what my bank said and said that she needed to get my money back. 
__label__1 Comcast treating customers like garbage - I called to cancel my Comcast services because I was moving. The woman I spoke with was very helpful and helped me cancel my services and said that I had overpaid and asked for my forwarding address so that she could send me a check. A few weeks later, I received a letter from a collection service saying that I hadn't paid my last bill. This hurts my credit score and greatly upset me. I called Comcast and the woman told me that the balance in my account was zero. She then transferred me to another person who informed me that I had canceled my account before I had paid my bill and that resulted in me owing money. But they couldn't take the time to call and let me know this information before they sent a collection agency after me! I hate Comcast!
__label__0 I couldn't get online in the internet although my internet phone worked. My internet phone is Vonage, not Comcast. When I called Comcast, Beatrice told me I would have to pay $39.99 for wireless help. This never happened before. It's a revenue drive, in my opinion.
__label__1 Ongoing problems over one year. They have replaced every item in my house and out to the pole, more than once. Management support, corporate involvement. It doesn't work. Intermittent repetitive issues. Every time, you start from square one. FRUSTRATION. There should come a time when Comcast states... WE CAN'T FIX IT. Time to move on. Has anyone else had a similar experience with the X1 Platform?
__label__1 On tuesday, I talked to Comcast at 8*** and had a Premium package set-up for 159.00 by Jeff. He sent me over to a George, who bundled a package with an extra HD DVR and 2 other HD boxes for a total of $168.95. I also had a $50 installation fee. This all was agreed upon. I went over this agreement at least 3 times before hanging up. The techs came in today and said they have the HD DVR that comes with the package and the reg. converters, but not the HD ones for the other 2 TVs. I talked on the phone with Kiasha, the manager, and she told me the two men will be "written up" but Comcast will not honor the agreement. This is, in my viewpoint, a "bait and switch" and I am angry that Comcast chooses to treat customers this way. I wasted my time on tuesday, and on thursday, waiting for the installers to start my service. They left saying they had the order and they couldn't do anything. This shameful practice should be stopped and someone needs to help consumers with this fraud. I have called and emailed Comcast about this, and the only response to this was that the gentleman who set it up will be written up. This is not acceptable.
__label__1 Let me start that on 5/9/15 me and my wife paid a deposit AND took care of a past due acct and decided to go with Comcast even though we had an active cable service with a competitor already connected. Sunday cable tech ran new lines to the house and left, NO signal from the new line, no internet all day, called 5 times and they assured me that MON. we would have service, guess what - NO service on Monday. Come to find out it was an open ticket for 8am to 8 pm. I lost my cool and they bumped me up to an "escalated" ticket for Tuesday. Guess what here it is Tuesday and NO tech no internet, I have called again at 5 more times and they said now they had me on an open ticket for all day... AGAIN! Now here it is going into Wed and I have an automated msg stating that I will have a service visit on Wed. from 1-3 pm. Let's see if this happens...I am SO frustrated at this whole ordeal, I don't even HAVE service and paid for it. The outsourcing aggravates me and every time I call I get some Indian csr with an English name like ** that has NO Clue to what's going on unless he reads my notations on my account which has been nothing but call after call after call waiting for a tech to activate my line for internet. I feel so stupid for disconnecting the other provider and it was ALREADY connected and running to my domicile!Here's what I learned, IF new cable has to be ran... that's what you get - ONE guy runs the cable, later a tech checks and activates the line on another date. NO MATTER how much or how many times you call, they will say anything to get you out of their hair, ANYTHING! The best thing to do is stay on the line as long as possible with them and hang up when done... why? Because every CSR is rated on how fast they get you done, that accounts for a Bonus, the longer you're on the lower their score, that lowers their bonus. Comcast service on the field sucks and this is before I actually have service with them JUST for internet.
__label__1 I moved in July and moved my service to my new apartment. I had an internet only package and Comcast switched me to a plan with crappy cable for 10 more dollars a month. I contacted them to switch back to previous plan and asked questions about how my bill seemed to double. Two days later my internet is barely able to load my internet client and when I called to find out what was going on, they had no explanation and needed to send out a technician. THEN, the rep tried to upsell me to the same plan that they had automatically upgraded us to when we moved.
__label__1 We moved to a place where Comcast is the only thing available right now. They reel you in with these packages. Well we have lived in three apartments in the complex. All the wiring is short. Try to get it fixed, "well it's the apartment's problem. No it's the cable company's problem". Well then they need approval from the apartment then get referred to the sales rep for the community. Still get nowhere and the never ending changes in bills, we get call to fix them and they're supposed credits get added on. Don't forget all the hidden fees you surprised with to get service in all the rooms and each box adds up. You can go pick up your boxes but never informed of that till they charged a lot of money to mail it. Then back to the wiring. It's so bad you have to have a tech come out and say it's free. Check the bill, 50.00 odd dollars in charges.Try to speak to customer service to work all this out, told we're wrong. They refuse to correct this bill. They're overcharging us 140.00 on this bill alone, taking the whole bill into consideration and we have to pay it cause our kid needs internet to do homework cause everything is online. They take and take with no account for who they affect. Bad, bad business practice. Shame on you money hungry people.
__label__1 If you have ANY other option (even cellular based internet) DO NOT, I mean DO NOT go with Comcast. Read other reviews. Constant Speed drops. Advertised at 150 Mbps, but get around 30 Mbps. Some days it's down to 0.9 Mbps. No change in network devices or cabling in the house. But they claim something is wrong. Oh! I forgot, my pet squirrel loves to unplug wires. So that must be it. Seriously people? Get some proper English speaking customer support specialists!!!
__label__1 I had cancelled my service on the 15th of March. My billing due date was on the 18th. All was fine and dandy. Ten days later, I got a bill saying that I owe double. After spending about a half hour in online chat, they said that I have to call and cancel my service. Instead of stringing me along all that time, tell me flat out that they can't help me and I need to call. So I called; now I can't get through. I was told I have a 13-minute wait. Finally, I got someone. I got the service cancelled back to the 15th (I have receipts for the equipment). They told me that I still owe when my bill wasn't even due yet (?). It was also fun to see them jockey the channels around, taking the most popular channels and moving them to the higher-priced services so you needed to upgrade to get them. I'm trying to figure out why Verizon can offer better services for a heck of a lot less. By the way, I switched to Verizon.
__label__1 For months, I and my neighbors have interrupted service for On Demand - tiling on the screen and my favorite, the lie they tell when your phone service goes out. When the screen is tiling, then your internet and phone also goes out. When someone calls you, they get a message that you are not accepting calls and to try later. Every time you call, it is India in the PM and Mexico in the AM. All they do is say, "We are sorry. Unplug for one minute and then wait for 30 minutes." If it doesn't work and you go to complain to one of their offices, they say it is the equipment. Never do they say it is their delivery service. I spent one week trying to get their equipment to work, but it was the code and they had me on limited Spanish basic.We (in our neighbor hood) want the service we pay for. Watch out. They find every and new ways to charge you. The newest is if you change a part of the service, there is now a $1.95 charge. Also, every charge goes up without notice.
__label__1 After many years of happy service with Fios, I was forced into Comcast's clutches when I moved to an area that doesn't support Fios. I spent hours on the phone with 2 people (1) dumb and (1) dumber setting up my plan, and I had to call back and speak to someone to correct their mistakes on the order. Just when I thought I was in the clear, I receive my 1st Bill and find a $150 Deposit Fee on it. I called kicking and screaming but all I got was lip service and apologies for the previous (3) people not telling me. I thought for a short second that maybe they really made a mistake when I found this systemic problem written about all other the web. Rip Off, Stupid, and downright Liars is what I have to look forward to. Fios please come to Leisuretowne Community in Southampton. I need you so badly.
__label__1 I recently signed up for Comcast bundled services. There were so many errors on our bill, beginning with the packages they were advertising at the time. We received our bill and it was a completely different package, charges for install, misc fees. I don't know what to make of it. I called numerous times to clear it up. Poor customer service. Do consumers have any rights at all? We have very little to choose from here; it's either satellite (DirecTV) or Comcast.
__label__0 After months of poor service and numerous calls to Comcast I requested an accounting of everything I have paid since signing up with Comcast, (appx. 18 months). I was told by many Comcast employees that there was no way for them to provide me with that information, and I would have to try and figure it out from the convoluted bill I receive each month. I believe I am being overcharged but have no way to prove it.
__label__1 We switched to Comcast over a month ago and it has been one of the... if not THE WORST experiences I've had with ANY company in my life. An installer and/or technician has been to our house a total of six (6) different times to fix our cable/internet and we are still having problems. Installer will come to check the connections and say, "we are not getting a good signal from the street." They will pass the buck to the "Guys is the Big Truck" as they call them. These technicians will come out check the connection from the street and say the signal is good (or that they fix something) and arrange for the installer to come back out. This has happened 3 times we still don't have a solid connection! Unbelievable... need more internet options other than AT&T and Comcast.
__label__1 I opened an account on the 9th September and my account got disconnected without my permissions on 21st September. After over 10 hours on the call and chat, nobody could figure out what happened and I was told the account is dead. So finally the resolution was that I open a new account which I did as of 24th September. I called later in that night to activate my modem, which I own, and they activated the service. When I wake up today I see that they activated the service on the account which was apparently disconnected on error. Now I have 2 accounts at the same location with the service I don't want.Cancelling an account without my consent was breach in my privacy. Also, Xfinity/Comcast made a hard credit check without my consent which is another major breach of my privacy. Every time I talk to an agent they give some new info. If nothing happens soon, I will be forced to sue Comcast for mental harassment.
__label__1 I am really surprise that Comcast never told me about rise the bill. That's foolish that I never heard the bill was 179 dollars! Without tell me no letter or no message, etc! Rip off!!
__label__0 I just realized my Comcast high-speed internet bill has practically doubled. When I signed up for it, no one from Comcast ever told me that the rate would increase. When I complained about this, the Comcast rep said that the service tech (who is a local contractor and not a Comcast employee) who installed it would have told us that the $42 was a promotional rate. I told the Comcast rep that I was not even home when internet was installed, so the rep then told me that the service tech (again, a non-Comcast employee) left information that said that the $42 a month was only a 6-month promotional cost. Why didn't Comcast tell me that when I was signing up for their service? Why does Comcast rely on a local contractor who is not even a Comcast employee to inform of forthcoming changes on my bill? I want to know why, when I was on the phone signing up for Comcast internet, that I was never told about the price increase. This is not right! I think that it is totally unfair that when I was on the phone signing up for the internet, a Comcast rep told me it was going to be $42 a month. They never said it was a promotional rate and was going to jump to $72. I think Comcast should tell you that when you are signing up for their service.
__label__5 I cancelled my service on June 6, 2014 by dropping off my equipment and stating to the Comcast representative that I wanted to cancel my service completely. My account had been paid through May 26, 2014. I have on three occasions spoken to company representatives about my final bill which is through the 26th of June. I should be charged for services received through June 6th. To date they have refused to adjust the bill and have now sent it to collections.
__label__1 If I could rate this company less than one star, I would. I have NEVER had such piss poor customer service and I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. And this is coming from a person who has worked nothing but customer service for the last 7 years... My first call was to set up service. I was on the phone for over an hour. I made it repetitively clear I just wanted the basic cable and internet bundle. Every 2 or 3 minutes the woman came back, told me the same redundant line "I'm just trying to find the best package for you". Not sure what's so hard about finding the bottom line cable and internet bundle. An hour later she assured me I had exactly what I asked for PLUS DVR for $85.99. My second experience was when the cable guy came and set up my cable, told me I did NOT get internet, and couldn't get my cable to work. He advised me to go into the service center and speak with someone in person. My third experience was at the customer service center when I found out that the woman I initially spoke with did not give me a cable/internet bundle for $85.99 but in fact signed me up for a $120.00 cable NO INTERNET service. The service center guy fixed her wrong doing, advised me to call and complain and have my first phone call pulled/listened to, and assured me I wasn't going to have a deposit. I actually saw the "customer approved, no deposit required" on his screen with my own eyes. So now my fourth experience was when a new guy came to set up my internet and fix my cable, which come to find out the first guy set it up wrong. This process took 3 weeks (remember, I still have no working cable or internet). I called to complain and have that phone call pulled and my price adjusted. I was told a supervisor would contact me within 24/48 hours. I never heard from anyone. I called again, was transferred 5 times before I could complain again, and again was told someone would respond within 7 days. Never heard from anyone. Now I have my first bill which showed a $150.00 deposit (the one the service center guy assured me I wouldn't have) a $30.00 charge for a modem that was supposedly shipped to me (this never happened I had a modem the whole time and never needed one shipped, never asked for one, nor did they even ship me one on accident. I was just charged for this) and I was charged for the 3 weeks of service when I didn't have cable or internet because of Comcast's mistakes. So I called AGAIN, complained AGAIN, and AGAIN was told a supervisor would contact me that business day. I never heard from anyone. Yesterday I demanded to speak to a supervisor. The Customer Service Rep basically refused to let me speak to his supervisor after I clearly asked 2/3 times. I told him to either adjust my bill to my satisfaction or send someone to come pick up their equipment and I will call AT&T. Their response? "We will remove all charges one full year after you first signed up for our service. Don't you worry Miss, one year of you having service with us we will be sure to remove all charges." NOPE! Do NOT even bother with Comcast. Please, trust me.
__label__5 I had an appointment with Comcast to have our internet switched to their service last Wednesday. That appointment was changed to today, 4/9, as they had the home number listed incorrectly. Instead, they had my cell number as the number to which the internet was to be connected to. We called Comcast and got the correct phone number to them and we were rescheduled to have the internet connected between 7:30 and 8:30 this morning. Today, I sat and waited from 6:30AM to 8:30AM with no call from Comcast. When I called to ask what happened, they claim they were locked out of the gated community and they called my phone and no one answered.This is a gated community, but my front door is directly on a street. There is no need to go into a gate to get to my apartment. You just need to go to the front door and knock. How hard is that? Also, they never called my cell phone as the tech claims and after reading all the comments of people who had bad experiences with Comcast, I read over and over where the techs called the home phone instead of the cell number that was left as a contact number. I have a home phone line, but not a home phone. We do not use our home phone line at all and that was explained to Comcast. After two bad experiences trying to get Comcast internet set up, I do believe this is a wake up call to not get Comcast internet! Comcast mixed up our phone numbers, our information, twice. I will not give them a third chance. If there is this much trouble trying to get their internet service, then I will take it as a sign not to go any further with this mess. Comcast seems to be too big for its britches. The commercials that Comcast has on TV about their excellent customer experience are just empty words.
__label__1 My girlfriend and I switched from an old Comcast box to the new X1 DVR box. It's been one problem after another. I watch NHL playoffs, so the first thing I tried to do was search for games and record them. I used the search function and found that Xfinity had the NHL playoffs listed as a "TV series" and had grouped every playoff game into "episodes". But not every playoff game showed up under the list of "episodes". So if I wanted to record some games, I had to flip through the guide hour by hour, channel by channel, day by day. When trying to record from the listing on the guide, I was only allowed to extend the recording (I always extend recordings of games in case of overtime) by 5 minutes. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. It's a fact that 90% of the use of extending recording is for sports in case of overtime. Approximately 0% of the entire earth's population wants to extend their sports game by 5 minutes. Next, I tried to record game 7 of the NY Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins. It appears as "Stanley Cup Playoffs" scheduled to air 4-6:30pm. After attempting to record the game, THE TITLE CHANGES to "NHL Live" and THE TIME SLOT CHANGES from 4-4:30pm! (And there is no NHL Live show scheduled in the guide). I extend the recording by 1 1/2 hrs and then the title CHANGES BACK to "Stanley Cup Playoffs", but the TIME SLOT stays the SAME!! So now, with 1 1/2 hrs extended time... The recording is now set for 4pm-6pm! Since the game is 3 hrs long, I missed the last hour of the game. THIS IS DIRECTLY DUE TO THE X1 XFINITY DVR SYSTEM.NOW.... I try to record Game 6 Chicago vs Minnesota listed for 6-8:30pm via the guide (this "episode" was not listed under "Stanley Cup Playoffs"). I hit record, try to add 1 1/2 hrs to the end of the game (this is the most you can add to the end of an "episode" ONLY IF YOU RECORD USING THE SEARCH FUNCTION), but the TITLE CHANGES to "Shark Tank" and DOES NOT add 1 1/2 hrs to the end of the game (end of recording remains 8:30pm). Once it hits 8:30pm, the recording stops. So I MANUALLY hit the record button in order to record the remainder of the game. The DVR DOES NOT let me record. I hit the button numerous times with no results. I tried going through the "INFO" screen to record and it finally DOES record, but by this time the GAME is on, but the guide says some other show is on and won't let me extend the recording.First, I called the standard customer service number and explained the problems I'd been having. The first guy I reached was VERY quiet and didn't say much of anything. A couple times I thought I lost connection. My hunch was that he was new. It's important to note that during this call, I was watching my favorite team play an NHL playoff game. It's also important to note that at this point, I had ALREADY missed SEVERAL games and ends of games due to Xfinity's poor DVR performance. So after another stretch of dead silence, all of a sudden my TV screen goes black in the middle of the game! I asked him if that was him doing something to the DVR and he said yes. That he had sent a "signal" to the box without saying a word to me about what he was going to do... Without asking if this was a good time... Without saying hardly anything at all! I just hung up the phone. Strange thing happened after that "signal" was sent... The screensaver now pops up randomly while watching live TV, while watching playbacks of recordings, while watching On Demand movies. So the "customer service" rep interrupted my hockey game to add another problem to my DVR box!I decided to call a second time to explain the problems I've been having with the X1 system, including explaining what had happened the last time I called. THIS representative proceeded to tell me how to turn the screensaver function off. As if that was the solution to THEIR problem. It was at this point that I realized that I was getting absolutely NOWHERE with calling "customer service". I decided to take more active measures in my quest for customer satisfaction. So I started sending e-mails. First to NBCSN to explain that hockey games are 3 hours long. You would think that since they're a sports network that they WOULD KNOW HOW LONG NHL HOCKEY GAMES LAST. NOT 2 1/2 hours. Not 2 hours. 3 hours!!Second, I began writing emails to Comcast (Xfinity...whatever it's called) to explain that the way the X1 DVR box performs seems thrown together and untested. The IDEA behind the format is a good one, but there are WAY too many "bugs" in this system to have released this garbage to the public. I sent an e-mail to Tom **. The reply I got was from someone named "Risa" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I replied with my account number so that they could more fully research my issues.The second email I got was from someone named "Lovasie" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I got a 3rd email from someone named "LaQuinta" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I got a 4th email from someone named "Betsy" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. Just when I was about to lose my mind... I get a phone call from Stephen ** who arranged to have a tech come out to my house to assess the functionality of my X1 DVR box. He said someone would be out to see me on 6/11/14 in the "early afternoon".No one called. No one showed up. I hate Comcast. I despise Xfinity. The only thing worse than their cable is their customer service. I think I may just stop paying my bill and use the X1 box for target practice.
__label__0  When we got through to comcast, they stated that they could no longer honor the three year contact but said I could have that price for one year and then pay the regular price after that. That is not what my contact says though. Several hours lost time on the phone to comcast for my wife who is a cpa.
__label__1 Comcast... service ordered on July 6th... promised install on the 14th - "that's the soonest we can do it". Tech shows up on the 14th and says the cable under the alley is broke. Utilities have to come and replace it. Was promised the work to be done on the 25th (today). Came home from the hospital to find no work being done. Called Comcast. "No, we aren't scheduled to do that work until August 4th". Complained to Comcast. "No, no one here ever told you that it would be done on the 25th". But they wanted to reschedule the interior install that they have scheduled for tomorrow... which means they did promise to do the work on the 25th. And no, they will not escalate or expedite the work.
__label__1 After being a customer of Comcast for about two years, and having many problems with them before, I moved from Virginia to the District of Columbia. Before moving, I put in a request to have someone from Comcast to come pick up the equipment that I had of theirs, but no one ever showed up. When I moved to DC, I called Comcast, and asked if I could take the equipment to an office in DC. Their response was no, and they would send me a box to put the equipment into, mail it back to them, free of charge to me. I said that would be great, however the box never came, and I received a call from someone from an outside company, asking about the equipment. I told her that they were supposed to send me something, so that I could send the equipment to them. She told me that she would send it off, but I never got it. I called and spoke with Sylvia in billing, to settle the remaining balance on the account. I paid for the last month of service, but not the equipment. I told her the situation, and she told me that she would mail the box off to me, but I never received it. After checking my credit report today, I realized that Comcast has reported that I owed them. I am outraged, because I have spoken with numerous people that stated they would send me what I needed, in order to return the product, and Comcast never notified me to say that they were turning my account over to collections, not even when I spoke to Sylvia, to pay the balance off.
__label__1 On August 16, 1011, I was approached by a Comcast representative and offered this great deal if I would sign up for Xfinity cable, telephone and high-speed internet. The package would help me save money as I already had all these services but separately, and I would be saving quite a bit if I signed with Comcast. The clincher was I was promised a $150.00 gift card for signing. I could really use the extra money so I thought that was really great. The rep said I would be receiving the rebate or gift card within 4 to 6 weeks after signing with Comcast. I waited 8 weeks before I called your offices to inquire about the rebate. At that time I was told I would have to wait until I had been a Comcast customer for 90 days in good standing. So I waited the 90 days, still no rebate. So I called again and this time I was connected with a very rude woman who informed me that I would have to wait six months. I told her that I had been told by other Comcast personnel that it was 90 days, so she checked and admitted that I was right and I should be receiving my rebate by the end of the next which would still be before the end of the year (2011). In the meantime, a friend of mine, who I had referred to the rep who signed me up, and he signed her up a day later, August 17, 2011, received her rebate. I called the rebate center in January 12, and the lady I talked to said that Comcast had never sent the rebate center my account papers. She said she would call Comcast and ask for my paperwork. Here it is the end of February 2012 and I still don't have the rebate I was promised. If I do not hear from your company or receive my rebate in the next few days, I will contact the New Mexico State Attorney General's Office, Consumer Affairs, and also the Better Business Bureau. Also, my telephone does not work every time it rains or snows and I am without phone service for hours at a time. I am about ready to cancel my service with you and go back to the company I had service with before.
__label__1 This is an example of how Comcast have left their installation at **, Savannah. Open to the weather and to any passing trouble maker. Total disgrace. Several attempts have been made for Comcast to fix this but no reaction. A poor statement of quality and will no doubt lead to service issues for the many customers. See pictures.
__label__0 We requested cable, internet, and phone service to be changed to a new location but requested that phone service be kept at old location. Comcast cancelled telephone service anyway at old location. They are making us wait five days to get new service and will not give us our old phone number. We have a son who has leukemia. The hospital, doctors, and school all have our cancelled phone number. We do have cell phones but we only previously gave out our cancelled home phone number. This is leaving us in a precarious situation. It will consume large amounts of time to contact every medical contact.
__label__1 I am new to Comcast, and I wish I never knew of them. It took them over a week to get my internet working, time they billed me for anyway -- this is not counting the hours and hours I spent on the phone and with their technician. Then they, all on their own, upgraded my service, and my bill. They said that I asked for it. I did NOT! They did refund me my money.
__label__0 I have been a Comcast customer for 6 years and have had numerous problems. Most recently, Comcast opened up a second account in my name and sent me two bills a month for several months for the same service. After calling every month for several months and having agents tell me I owed money on both accounts, it was resolved by an agent who stated that she would put me on a promotion of $55/month before taxes because of my troubles.This month, I received a bill of over $360 retroactively charging me for internet. The customer service agents claimed I was not charged for internet and my bill should have been billed about $85/month. They claimed my promotion would have only saved me $10/month, which is not a substantial benefit to me, and for such a large corporation as Comcast, it is definitely not a large loss. However, $300 of retroactive charges is a substantial loss to me and a minuscule benefit to Comcast. I want a full credit for these retroactive charges. I was told my bill would be $55. And if I knew my bill would still have been $85 with the promotion, I would have immediately switched to another service provider.Therefore, retroactively billing me is inappropriate, because it is against your agent's representation and Comcast would not have received that money at all had I known I was still going to be charged so much for the service. The customer service agents I've talked to said they don't have the power to fix this. Comcast needs to start spending far less money on their commercials and much, much, much more money improving the accuracy and efficiency of their billing, getting more qualified customer service agents, and improving the quality of their services. And why not give something back to customers by reducing the ridiculously high rates. In the meantime, I'm leaving Comcast ASAP. They've lost yet another customer because of their deficiencies.
__label__1 So I've been paying Comcast for services that does not work for 2 months. Then to add insult to injury, a lying freaking rep name Danielle that's located at the Woodridge office, lied and told me it was an outage in my area because she didn't feel like doing her job, and TS my box... only to find out tonight I need a different box and on demand was never out. So I've went almost 2 months due to a lazy rep not doing her job! Had me missing Power, watching it on my phone.
__label__1 I tried to help Comcast fix my outages because I honestly preferred their tv package, but the 2 to 5 a day service interruptions got to be too much after 4 months of bad service. Most outages, lasted less than a half hour, but some lasting as long as 5 hours. I can deal with irregular tv service, but it's annoying when I have invested 50 minutes in watching a mystery, and the damn things goes out for the last ten minutes. But I do a lot of work on the internet, and that went down too, and was slower to come back. But the main problem was the unreliability of the phone... we need reliable phone service for EMERGENCIES. When they failed to stop the outages I had to get a different provider because I (and everybody else) needs a phone in case of sickness in the middle of the night or if the house catches fire or there is a gas leak. Or for a civil defense warning.There is no reason at all to pay for reliable phone service and then have it going off at random times and the provider not doing everything they can to fix it. There was the irony of my being charged by my cell phone company because I had no phone service from the company I was paying to provide phone service. So had to pay another phone company to tell them that their service stinks. I'm 80 years old and I live alone, so reliability is very important to me. Comcast is refusing to waive the punishment for canceling, and claiming that all they needed to do is try (or pretend to try) to fix it, and that it wasn't necessary for them to actually fix it because they could find nothing wrong... My next door neighbor is having the identical outages and, as far as I know, there has been no coordination of effort to figure out why both of us have the same bad service.I quit 3 weeks ago because I was sick of being reminded every day that I can't rely on their bad service. I live alone, As of last week, my neighbors are still having outages. Comcast claims that their only duty was to try to fix the problems, and failing to fix them is irrelevant, so I was bound by my contract to continue with the bad service. If they weren't so rude and such bullies, it would be almost humorous. They told me that the final decision to not waive the penalty was made by the technicians. The same guys who failed to fix my service.They even told me to be sure to keep my cell phone charged in case my house catches fire. I am wondering when is the last time they upgraded their equipment in my area. Six and 1/4 years ago, when my husband was awaiting surgery that he didn't survive, he got an angry letter from his main doctor saying that he couldn't reach us by phone. I called friends and they said they couldn't reach us either. We found out by experimenting that OUR PHONE WAS NOT RINGING. I called Comcast in tears and they told us to poke the modem with a ballpoint pen, and when that didn't work, they said there was NOTHING they could do. I had to charge a cell phone in the car and call all of his doctors to give them that number and then pay the high cost of many cell phone calls. I vowed to never subscribe with them again, but a huckster appeared at my door and promised that the technical issues had been resolved.I do like their tv packages better than others, so, believing this guy, I agreed to give them a try. There were few outages the first month, or I would have quit in the trial period. The constant outages started up the second month, both for me and my neighbor. At about the same time the electric company put up a new power pole. Now I have a daughter-in-law in Asia who is having a health crisis and I was not able to be available for her calls. When my son called to tell me of the crisis, we were cut off twice, and we couldn't reestablish the connection. The outages seemed completely random, and each time the tv would come back on a long time before the phone and internet reappeared. I had no choice but to get a more dependable provider. I have had the new one for over 3 weeks and I have had no outages at all. NONE.There was a problem with making overseas calls, but between their skilled technicians and my helping them, my new provider figured out that the problem was with the cordless phones. I can make calls to Europe and Asia with my 1960-s princess phone. When I asked Comcast about whether or not they are obliged to provide satisfactory service, their reply was that I should have read the contract. I was given no opportunity to read anything. The guy who appeared at my door instructed me to agree to try by giving an okay by phone. I have never seen a company with service this bad and with so many loopholes to keep them from honoring their obligation to provide dependable service.If there is a class action suit, I will be happy to join it. I contacted them many times about outages and they knew that they weren't fixing a damn thing, and yet they refused to waive the penalty, and when I complain that I was PAYING for reliability, they bully me say that they tried to fix stuff and failed, so it must be my fault. If it's my fault, how come the Verizon service is so reliable and their technicians are so polite and so capable?
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer since 1975 (formerly Highland Video before acquisition). My monthly pricing seemed to steadily increase until I finally called to ask for an explanation. After getting nowhere with their customer service, and continually trying to stop them from trying to upgrade me, I finally told them to simply give me the same basic deal that they advertise on TV. Basic cable, internet and phone (Triple Play). The "Basic package. I was told that my internet would slow down, I could no longer make long distance phone calls and I would receive a lot less channels for which I replied "FINE". I was then told that I would have to turn in my HD equipment, then the representative hesitated and said "oh never mind, you don't have HD equipment". It didn't register at the time, until I printed out all of my past statements and noticed an alarming trend. Somewhere along the line, someone from Comcast entered data that placed me into the HD category. I do not own HD TV's. I started looking at my bills and noticed that for years I was bring charged $170.49 per month for HD Preferred Service. Once I called to seek an explanation for the constant increases, I was placed in the "basic" package for $92.95 per month for which I have been paying since. The overcharges were in my mind intentional. Being a Senior Citizen, I am very angry and wonder just how many other people are overcharged for services not rendered. I feel that several thousand dollars in overcharges have been sent to Comcast in a timely fashion, never late, always on time. For being a loyal customer, I get the short end of the stick. I am contacting the BBB and also the FCC.
__label__1 There have been several attempts to switch over to Comcast from DIRECTV. Comcast has refused to give me a clear reason as to why they can't. Their follow up has been nothing short of poor.It seems that DIRECTV has a hold on our condo building, although the condo association has confirmed that there isn't a bulk agreement in place. I was informed from an outsource that Comcast won't service my building and/or area because there shows a contract with another provider. It may be that this was arranged by PUD.Apparently, several units in our building have tried to sign with Comcast without any success. State Officials need to clear the way for cable competition and for cable viewers.
__label__0 A complete bungling; bottom line, I wasted valuable time off from work to be here for the installation. The guy showed up on time, not his fault, but the operator who took my order completely lied to me about the services they were providing. The installer did not have the order correct, and they wanted to add three DVRs at a cost of $45 per month over what they told me my fees would be. I told them to go away. I'd rather stay with Dish, who I am already unhappy with, better to stay with the devil I know. Thus, after calling four to five times and getting different pricing depending upon the operator I got, I should have known the outcome would not be good. I do not recommend Comcast for any reason.
__label__1 Xfinity is absolutely the worst. Everything about this company is awful. The equipment is the worst, always fails, constant rebooting. I thought maybe just me? So I went to neighbors and friends all same experience. Customer service awful. On hold transferred 5 different people endless spiral. Internet not built to handle lots of devices. Just save your money and headache.
__label__1 Comcast is the worst cable company. They charge you all these extra fees and on top of that you have to pay an expensive bill. I have one box and my cable with from 50 dollars to 343.60. What kind of ** is that. They should be ashamed of themselves. Besides AT&T doesn't even charge that much.
__label__1 I have had Comcast/Xfinity for the last couple of years, on and off. My experience with their customer service has been horrifying. Unable to get a person on the phone, long waits to get a representative to assist me. Customer service out of the country with little experience. Customer Service in the USA not properly trained to handle complaints or well equipped to service clients. My internet has not worked properly in the last three months, I have called almost every day and I am unable to find someone to actually assist me. I have been unable to receive a credit on my account and have had to resource complaining on this site to see if something is done. Why do they let companies like Comcast operate? Is there no regulations on service?
__label__5 I call and call and get the same old responses which never help. They only want to sell me something to better my experience. Blast is what I need to get a better connection for my internet, they say. I don't want Blast, they put it in my account anyway. I ask for them to remove Blast ($12.99/month), they remove it. A month later I see Blast back on my account. Comworst is such a scam. If I were scamming people the way they do I would of been locked up long ago. I always say, if you ain't got tons of money in this world, you ain't nothing.
__label__1 I have had phone and Internet through Comcast since July 2011 (about 4 months).  They sold me on their services when they stated on the phone and their Internet site that you can own your own modem and not pay a monthly service to rent theirs.  I have my own and it was on the list of modems that qualify.  However, this is not the case.  Comcast has billed me a rental fee every month since I have signed up with them.  My husband and I have both tried to resolve this matter, but Comcast refuses to stick with their 100% customer satisfaction guarantee.When we call, they are unprofessional, leave us on hold for far too long, and when they get back on the phone, it is never the supervisor or the manager that I requested.  It normally takes about three hours to even get a supervisor on the phone, and when they do finally get on the phone, they tell us that they have to open an investigation into the matter.  This has been going on for about three months and I have even taken the modem up to their office so they could verify that it did not belong to them.After they scanned it into their computer, I gave them some time and called them back (about two weeks) but they did not even have my modem in their system.  Actually, they have no notes in their account in regards to this matter.  I have made several complaints to this company in regards to their service and they do very little to resolve any of the issues.  I still have the line they ran outside hanging on by a shoelace.  I have heard about 10 different times that they need to take care of this and they will make an appointment.They actually sent someone out (2 trucks) who backed up to the pole, looked at the shoe lace real closely, and then left without even speaking to us or looking at us (it is still not fixed).  I am very frustrated and I am getting no help from this company.  I have seen many other people with the same complaints and I honestly want to start a class action lawsuit.  This company needs to be stopped!
__label__0 On and about 9/16/10, I called Comcast because my DVR cable box wasn't working and spoke with one of the reps. He told me that he was going to troubleshoot my box and he did. Then he told me to put my television on channel 3 and I did. Then on 9/17/10, I received a letter saying that I had to give them a deposit. I called Comcast on 9/17/10 and spoke with one of the reps. I asked why did they run my credit without my permission nor did the rep say he was running my credit. I asked to speak with a manager and was told there wasn't any managers around, so I said have one of the managers to call me ASAP.When one of the supervisor (Omaar) called me, I told him what had happened and he said he would get back to me on the following Tuesday. He did but without an answer. I called Comcast back again on 10/4/10 and spoke with Ann at 2:38PM. I told her the same story and asked for a supervisor. She got the same results (no supervisor was available) but she did say she spoke with her supervisor (Mr. **). He said he was going to remove the deposit and never done anything. I told them at Comcast that it is illegal to run someone's credit and don't tell them anything about running it or getting their permission. I had to keep calling Comcast about this problem and I was always told they were going to remove it but they never did until I called back on 10/13/10 at 12:36PM and spoke with Timothy. He said he was putting in the paperwork to have this deposit removed from my bill. I have been with Comcast since 2007 and never had to give a deposit. I refused to give one now.
__label__1 Comcast sent an employee out knocking door to door in our neighborhood shortly after we moved in. We were in the process of transferring our ATT service over from our previous address and after convincing us he could reduce our monthly cable bill by as much as 75%, we agreed to give them a 12 month trial. 12 months of pure hell is what was in store for us!! Weekly service interruptions, internet speed 10 times slower than advertised and bills that seem to increase monthly without any notification from these scumbags. After multiple complaints and phone calls and multiple attempts of having technicians out at our house to research repair issues with no real solution, a Comcast representative informed us over the phone that it was in our best interest to just increase our current service to get a faster internet. Knowing I was locked into a contact for another 6 months, I agreed that if I am stuck with these crooks for another 6 months, I'll pay a little more each month and gain the benefit of faster internet. Well, lo and behold, what I did not realize, was that by agreeing verbally over the phone to have our internet service boosted up to the fastest level, I was unknowingly committing to another 24 month contract. After never receiving any documentation or notification of this new contract, the 6 additional months of a joke of a cable service had finally came to an end. When we finally called to cancel, knowing our original 12 months of hell was over, it was brought to our attention that we have a remaining 18 months on our contact of being stuck with this garbage cable company full of low life's and liars. I immediately argued and asked for a copy of this so-called contact that we signed and was told that conveniently for them it is company policy they cannot send it to me. Not via mail and not via email. When I told them I didn't care and I still wanted to cancel they told me that to do so I am liable for a $250 early termination fee and if I did not pay it, that additional fees would apply and they would send to collections and damage my credit.Can we be held responsible for a contract we did NOT sign? A contact that as far as we understand, does NOT exist. A contract that the seller is refusing to publish or make available to the buyer. This is a scam! It's a pathetic scam and a shame. Even if we are under contract, is Comcast not in breach of this contract for failing to provide its clients with a proper duty of care? I'm sure the contract should read that the client agrees to pay for x, y and z service from the seller only if x, y and z are actually being provided to properly to the buyer right? The real crime is that x, y and z SUCK and Comcast SUCKS!!True Story: I once called Comcast to report an internet outage, they told me they needed to verify my account and needed either my account number or the exact dollar amount of my last payment. I responded no problem, then paused and stated that I could not provide either of those to them because Comcast setup us up with paperless billing and that in order to retrieve that information I would need access to my email which would require a working internet service. Comcast response: "Well you will have to call your bank, find out the dollar amount of the last payment and call us back." Are you kidding me??? This is how you do business???Another mind blower: Did you know that if you call Comcast to report a service interruption they will have a someone over the phone attempt to walk you through a step by step process of resetting the equipment installed in your home by Comcast. If after 2 hours of this fails and the end result is that Comcast has to send a technician out to your home to fix the issue (like actual "work"), they bill you a service charge for their faulty equipment. But wait, you can avoid this service charge if you agree to pay them a monthly service charge protection fee. Hang on, so... you mean to tell me, that if I as the consumer who is simply renting your crappy equipment experiences a problem with your crappy equipment, you will invoice me to for your technician to come fix your own crappy equipment? And if I want to avoid that fee, I have to pay you basically an insurance premium for your crappy equipment? How the ** is that even legal? The fact that these crooks get away with this, is an absolute travesty. Can anybody please help?
__label__1 We have used Comcast for almost 20 years since it is the only high-speed internet available. We have not had consistent service. I have spent innumerable hours waiting for someone to answer the phone, then waiting as they are supposed to call back but 9 out of 10 times do not. The problem was fixed once when a contracted technician came out and said the cable that runs from our house to the street is so long, it requires a larger cable. After a mouse chewed it up, they replaced it with a smaller cable stating it was not needed. We have had issues ever since. I have been told we need to pay the upper fee, but I tried this once before and it didn't work. I got them to finally let us have a free trial, and it is actually worse which, in my eyes, confirms the problem is the cable.It is too small to carry the information going to and from the computer. Because we are at the end of the their service area, I have now come to the conclusion that we won't ever have continuous service. After a month of trying out the higher rate, we want to cancel as it has made our WiFi even worse and the hardwired computers work the same way. It is not worth the extra money and Comcast can't figure out what is wrong and really doesn't care as they know they have no competition where we live. I contacted them, but as always, the supervisor has not called me back. Their company is a joke. I would change in a flash if we had a choice.
__label__1 For the last 6 months the internet is constantly going down and when you call customer service you are on hold forever and all they do is tell you, "Yes an outage has been reported" and claim to credit your account but have nothing about the constant outages! If I ran my business like this I would be shut down! Where is the accountability? This company is horrible. They always tell you "Oh the outage should be resolved in 2 to 4 hours or more!" Then you get a call or text saying it's resolved and you try your internet and it is still down??? One time the customers service guy told me it's because a lot of people in my area are streaming and it slows the internet down??? What the heck how can this be ok?? I would never recommend Comcast. They are just as bad if not worse than AT&T.......
__label__0 Scheduled new service between 1-3pm. No one came until 5:15pm. No call from technician or dispatch for reason of delay. Lived in northeast Phila for 10 yrs. 3 different places and never had bad service until I moved to west Phila. I feel that your company treats people in the lower income parts of the city with really bad service compared to the suburban areas of Phila, PA.
__label__1 Have had problems with their connections. Suppose to come out one day and did a no call no show. Been now 2 weeks without service and they are giving me a 12 hour window when they say 2 hours on their advertising.
__label__1 Called Comcast a month ago to complain about price. Was given free HBO. Called on 08/15/15 because billed 10.00. While in the call dvr and TV was shut off. While waiting for a solution, agent mentioned a second dvr, told her I did not have another TV. Agent added dvr box without my permission. Called at 8:00 am on Sat 08/16/2015, asked for supervisor to contact me, never did. Called from 8 until noon, agents said they would not take off 2nd dvr until I returned dvr that I did not have. Went down to the physical store, spoke to the supervisor Carlos in Naples who said problem was fixed... no apologies. Got home... my DVR is not working!!! Worst company ever!
__label__0 I went online to sign up for comcast cable and internet. When I put in my address and phone number the site says that both are available to me. I then called to schedule the connection and was told that I couldn't get it. I called 1800comcast to ask why. I was told by a lady that it was available to me and that they would call me back to schedule connection. In a couple days I called back. Andrea told me that there was no problem it was just never hooked up at this address and that they would schedule the appointment as soon as a tech was available. The next day Andrea called and left me a voicemail message stating that the tech said that there is not service down my road and they can't provide service to me. I called again on 9-2-08 to find out why they say I can get it and then say no. Patty told me that now they have it in the system as not servicable as of the 21st of Aug. She said the tech said that I am 4 miles from the service box. I think they should have to provide me with service after them telling me I can get cable and internet. I also have the email from Romeo stating that these services are available to me. I want them to provide me with cable and internet like they told me they could.I now have to use dial up and have no tv for my kids to watch. I am trying to work online and it is impossible to do so with dial up. I am losing money and I am a single mother with 13 and 14 year old daughters.
__label__1 Our phone and internet lines frequently drop off, and we called Comcast a number of times with the same problem. On various occasions technicians came over to 'fix' the problem, but never really did - we just kept getting charged for rewire after rewire. Recently, when we called to report yet another connection problem, and asked billing questions, Comcast disconnected one of our phone lines, citing later there was a misunderstanding, and to reactivate the line would take another 2-3 days. The billing error was not caused by us - important to mention we've been Comcast customers for a long long time, and never late on any of the payments. Moreover, we're on an automated payment system. Would not recommend Comcast to my friends, and are actively looking for alternative service for phone, internet, and TV.
__label__0 Replaced box and never worked.  They tell you managers will call you and they never do.  Tell you they will get someone out and no one shows.  Then find out never even entered work order.  Without cable and no indication will ever get it fixed.
__label__1 Bad reception - Digital is not what was to be expected. Many shows missed due to no reception.
__label__0 I'm a 15-yr. Comcast customer, no disconnections ever. In Dec. 2008 due to a very large cut in my income, I called Comcast to switch from the $54/mo. plan to the $18/mo. plan. The last thing I got from Comcast was my statement/past due notice dated Feb. 25 for $146 (which I believe is an overcharge but I can't find my old statements). In early March I made an online payment of $62. On March 14 a Comcast serviceman came to my front door and spoke with my son (I'm deaf and don't deal with people at the door). He wanted $25 to avoid disconnection. I refused because I had not heard anything from Comcast and he was not driving a Comcast truck. Then he said he would take $52rt (five dollars!) which sounded suspicious. I wouldn't pay because he did not give us any papers showing a pending disconnection, and since I already made a payment for this month, I thought I was safe. A week went by and I heard nothing from Comcast. Then on Sat. March 21 while I was away, the same Comcast serviceman disconnected my cable service. He said he knocked on the door but nobody was home, which was a lie because my son was home and would have heard it. In the past when I was close to being disconnected, they would put a notice on my front door with a phone number to call. I take disconnect notices very seriously and always call the number to make arrangements. This time I got NO such notice. I was contacted via e-mail by Mr. Rudy V at the Fresno Comcast (manager), after I explained my situation. He said there was nothing he could do because I owe $82 and he couldn't find anything wrong with the serviceman's behavior. Then, on Thursday, March 26, I received in the mail a disconnection notice dated March 22, the day AFTER my cable was disconnected. If I had received it on Friday, March 20, I would have called immediately and made payment arrangements. Then, on Saturday, March 28, I got in the mail a Collection Notice from Credit Protection Association L.P. Isn't it the law that companies MUST give the consumer, in writing, advance notice of pending collection activitiy? I NEVER received any notice whatsoever of disconnection or collections. This whole incident is so unfair and I feel ripped off. I want Comcast to reconnect my cable and waive the fees and charges. The whole purpose of downgrading my Comcast service from $54/mo. to $18/mo was because I could no longer afford $54/mo. But they demanded I pay the entire bill ($146) in March. When I only paid $62 (which was already above my budget limit), they cut me off.
__label__1 Paying for over 100 mbps bandwidth... Getting less than 20 mbps and that's in the best place. I tested all over the (small) house getting down to about .2 mbps in the worst place. Comcast robs their customers.
__label__1 I have been with Comcast for three months and when I signed up for service I was promised a 100 gift card for signing up with them with the Triple Play. I made four calls to Comcast about the gift card, which they told me you had to wait 90 days until you get the card. During the four times I was on the phone with the untrained customer reps, no one told me if you're late or have any problems with your account you will not get the card. Do not sign up for the Triple Play and think you are to get a gift card, if so don't be late because you will never receive it. Poor customer service, will not be using them anymore after my 12 months is done. Choose a better provider when choosing your cable service. But the supervisor did offer free premium channels for a month and I decline because that wasn't a good deal to take despite I work all the time.
__label__0 Comcast removed 10 more channels from our line up this past week. They (Comcast) have been advertising on TV that if you have Comcast you don't have to worry, and that they will take care of everything regarding the switch to digital. Comcast also sent out postcards tellng people we could recieve a converter box FREE for one whole year to gain access to the channels they just moved to digital.   When I called Comcast and inquired about the coverter box, I was told I would have to pay $111.00 to qualify for the converter box. My Comcast bill typically runs 30 days behind,as the company bills in advance for services. I had just paid my bill on the 16th of July, and now on the 18th they want yet more money.   The FREE Converter box offer expires on August 15, 2008. After that date, it will cost Comcast customers $3.95 a month plus taxes to recieve the channels Comcast just moved and took off our line up.   I imagine there are many people like myself who do not have their Comcast bill current.   Comcast want me to continue to pay for a service I no longer have, and then charge me extra to recieve something that they just took away. I agreed to pay for the channel line up that I started out with at Comcast. Now, I have lost 10 additional channels, yet my bill have not gone down. I also will not be able to get the converter box as I do not have an additional $111.00 to pay before the 15th of August.   I think Comcast should have to do what they have been telling customers they will do. 
__label__1 Service is terrible... Customer service is terrible. Price is horrible. Billing is never correct... Bill is always incorrect. Often bill for service I do not have or have never agreed to. Trying to get help is impossible. When service is out, which happen often, it is impossible to get credit on your bill. I call customer service to get credit. They will lie and tell you the credit is applied to account. But after months of calling and recalling it is never credited. I don't ever take the time to write a review, but I am so disgusted with Comcast that I made the time to write and inform other people of the poor quality. Please please please do not go with Comcast... You will regret it. The price appear like a good deal at first, but believe me, it will go up sky high. I started off with triple pay bundle for 89.00 dollars a month. Years later my bill for basic cable and slow internet is 198.00 a month. Everybody I know that have Comcast is very unhappy!!!! Enough is enough. Time to go back to the old rabbit ears and cancel service and free myself from all the Comcast drama!!! (and file a report with the Texas Utility Commission and BBB...)
__label__0 On 3-15 I placed an order with Comcast to provide me with telephone, internet and TV. I was told the equipment for my order would be at my house by 3-22. On 3-24, I still had not received my equipment. I called Comcast and asked the status. The agent said he would have to talk to his manager. He came back on the line and told me that the person that originally took my order had not released the equipment to ship. He told me as a result of Comcast error, he would ship the equipment overnight and I would have it on 3-25. He gave me a confirmation number and told me that I could track the shipment at Comcast.net.On 3-25 I went online for 20 min. and could not find any way to track my order. I called Comcast and after lots of waiting got a rep who told me that there is no way to track an order on Comcast.net. He transferred me to another department. The rep from the new department told me that the order was not shipped overnight and I would get it in 3-5 business days.I asked to talk to his supervisor who was Monik employee# Semo0610. Monik told me that Comcast did not have any equipment to ship due to their vender delays and that all orders in March had been delayed due to this. I asked Monik why none of the half-dozen Comcast employees I had spoken to had told me this. Instead they all said you will get your components in x-days.Monik could not tell me when the order would be shipped but it would not be before April. She then told me that I would need to go through the order release process all over again because this needed to happen again because the order was delayed. I asked to speak to her superior and was told that there was no person I could talk to and that Comcast managers do not receive or return calls. So right now, I have been lied to a number of times and I have no idea when I will get my equipment. This is not a way to run a company and I will not accept this kind of extremely bad service. I do not know when or if I will have phone service or internet.
__label__1 I just found out that Comcast does not supply the battery backup for phone modem but they do not let you know that until you call in and ask where the battery is. I called and asked what if the power goes out. They said that you have to buy the battery for $35. I told them that they should let customers know this because I am disabled and need my phone. I was told, "Too bad, buy the battery." The modem they took out and replaced had a battery. I ordered my new modem for the new speed they told me about and needed a new modem so they replaced it. I think that Comcast should notify their customers about this. There are a lot of disabled people out there that need a phone 24 hours a day.
__label__1 Last week, Friday, I set up services to have at my place residence. Just to make sure there is no deposit, I called and spoke with 3 different people and they seem to be not aware of the package deal that I have already set up and about to finalize it. Each person was incompetent of not locating the package and was unable to properly navigate the same website, to which I have navigated to get the package deal. Being frustrated by this, I just finalized the package deal and scheduled my appointment for May 16, 2012 between the hours of 11AM and 5PM. Today, I received a message on my phone stating that I must return some equipment and pay for a balance on some account. I called to find out about this and was told that this account belongs to my sister, which she has the same last name as mine. I have told them that this should have nothing to do with me and that is her account. I have been a customer in the past, in good standing and paid all my bills and returned any equipment. They told me that because I have cancelled my services and she started her service, that I have to still pay for her balance and be charged for the equipment if I don't return it. I feel like this is a bad relationship to start with a previous customer in good standing and that with the monopoly of the area, they are being very abusive making the consumers to pay for other accounts that don't belong to them. This is very bad business practice. Because of this type of practice and the monopoly over the area, it leaves me to not have any internet services at all.
__label__1 I operate a retail establishment heavily dependent on phone service. Our phone service went out Monday because of an equipment malfunction of their equipment. By phone they promised to have someone out by 5:45 the same day to replace the equipment. Ok, no problem. Things happen. At 6:30 they still no show and by then they said it would be the next day. This morning (Tuesday), today they say Wednesday maybe. Can I take them to small claims court?
__label__0 Also some of my video on my site at some point was not working. Guess what? Comcast had decided to turn on a firewall in my modem which blocked all my video. Great! Got that fixed with help desk.Tech guy did great job. Figured out that modem was old, wire in our yard was old and insufficient. So, he put temporary solution. Everything back up. Great! As happy as a little kid. Then came techs to put real wire. Everything low again after that. So other tech came back out and fixed things again. So happy for a while.Today decided to check again my speed, guess what? Yes, Comcast was super slow again. Called help desk. Tomorrow another tech comes out. Frankly, I hate Comcast, I don't trust them. I will give them another chance. Oh, forgot to mention, they charged my $27 for a "Customer Complaint Call". How about that? Deliver a lousy service and charge for that. Comcast should be very rich. Anyone out there. If you have other options, consider them first!
__label__1 My wife and myself attempted to carry our service from one location to our new location. New location had never had Comcast service therefore they had to do site inspection. This was last week 8/14, never heard from anyone. Called back yesterday to check status and place order. They took our order but could not give install date. Stated someone would be in contact with us for date. After waiting 24 hours called in and after speaking with 5 different people was told again it would be 24 hours before they can give a install date. We have over 2 hours involved in trying to give this company our business until finally telling them to cancel our order. We was prepared to sign 2 year contract of a monthly revenue of $160 month. Seems with their lack of concern of our service they don't need our business. I will never use Comcast again and trust me every person I hear that needs cable will hear this story in full. Hello DirecTV or AT&T.
__label__1 I signed up this summer for their $10 a month internet plan. Well my mistake I didn't realize the apartment didn't have cable hookups. Called to cancel was told no problem. Well fast forward three months am getting collection calls for an account I cancelled - come to find out they never cancelled it. Well they credited my account. I ended up giving them the benefit of the doubt and signed up for an upgrade. Was told I needed a deposit. Called back when I had it and was told I didn't need it. Well ok. Were supposed to come install Wednesday. First guy would not do the job without a letter from the apartments. Which was not needed, got that confirmed and they resent a new tech which turned out to be the same guy who had another excuse to why he couldn't do the job. No worries said comcast. Sent out a new guy. He came in, looked around and said they needed a pre-bury tech. Well now it is friday and nobody has come back. Apparently a supervisor is on his way. We shall see. So sick of this and I haven't even started services yet - smh.
__label__1 Our service went down 8 days ago and a Comcast service tech came out to our office to see if it was our equipment. He stated that the lines were messed up on Comcast's home office end. We got service back up after a few hours and the tech said he tried it and all lines are working and trunking to each other and no voice mail is on them. After he left we received complaints that our customers couldn't get through and we found out only one of our lines was working all the rest were not. Now have been working was their customer service which shouldn't be called service at all. It's a joke same as their supervisors. We have lost $1,000's of dollars and Comcast could care less. If you own a business do yourself a favor and don't consider Comcast!!!!!
__label__0 Since 2006, one of the charges on my Comcast bill was HDTV Digital Converter for $39. Starting in July 2009, Comcast changed the description of this charge. It now reads "HDTV Digital Converter 6 @ $6.50 each for $39. It suddenly became obvious to me that I had been paying for 5 extra HDTV digital converter boxes (I have only one HDTV digital converter box in my house). Comcast had overcharged me a total of $1,050 over three years. Eight different Comcast customer service representatives verified that it was a billing error, and eight different customer service representatives told me that I should have been checking my bill more closely. One customer service representative told me that he would do me a favor by crediting my account $195 since Comcast is only required to refund up to 3 months of erroneous charges. I think I deserve a full refund. Comcast's previous billing methods were deceitful and misleading. If I was being charged for more than one converter, the charge should have been listed as converters not converter. The customer service representatives told me that I should have known that $39 was excessively high for one HDTV converter box; however, since I purchased the HDTV converter box within a plan/bundle, I did not know the specific breakdown of charges. I am also used to Comcast's high prices, so I did not think twice about the $39 charge per box. Honestly, that is how I was thinking. By the way, I still cannot find a price list anywhere on Comcast's website that lists $6.50/converter box.
__label__1 I've been complaining for months about slow internet around 1 to 5 mbps and not able to open emails half the time. Finally they agreed to send someone out after I went and got another modem from Comcast and bought a new wifi router and still no improvement. The day before they came out, I was getting 3.34. The day they sent a tech, I was getting 25 to 60 mbps. I have a history on my speed tests every month for years, and they haven't had that speed for over 6 months, except the day the tech came out. They have been throttling my account. It's so wrong!!!
__label__0 On average for the past three months, I have been having internet issues. About three months ago, I was having disconnection issues, I called Comcast numerous times to have them re-prevision the speeds on the modem; sometimes they work and it would last a few hours but then the speeds would drop back down again. Then, I called back a third time and they told me my account settings was incorrectly noted for my speeds. They fixed it and I didn't have any trouble till about a month ago.I started having major outages here in our area, and my next door neighbor was having issues as well .They always seem to have issues maintaining their networks. Well, close to two weeks ago, Comcast started doing some Node 46617 area work where they upgraded the system. I didn't know what they upgraded for a while but ever since the work was done, I have been having nothing but problems with a connection or even speeds to work with me.I pay $93 a month with TV usage of basic which is $20 for others and I'm paying so much money and regular price for internet I can barely even use. For 13 days straight I have had intermediate speeds of anywhere from 9.83Mbps to 14.29 Mbps down stream, and my upstream has been anywhere from 0.01 Mbps to 1.87 Mbps.The upstream has been so erratically slow to the point that I cannot even send data packets to anything like my PC ER client's to my contractor for PC networking jobs. For about a week and a half dealing with this problem, I have been calling several times. I must at least make a count of 14 total calls through out the week and 27 online instant chat sessions with the Comcast company.Three of them I have been completely ditched and disconnected from them with out any response or resolve and left me out in the dark with no internet connection at all. The client support service is horrible. I have had technicians from their department say that my modem was bad to my lines might be bad. I have had technician come out here and find nothing wrong except for one technician that saw pictures of my log files showing at times when the internet would drop to literally nothing.I pay $20.00 under $100.00 a month for service that is should contain speeds of 20.00 - 25.00 Mbps down stream, and up stream speeds of anywhere from 2.00 - 4.00 Mbps. I don't even get 2.00 Upstream speed anymore, it's always 0.01- 0.63 Mbps.Now, I have a technician coming over Monday to make the drops because of the tech yesterday on Saturday failed to make a line drop repair call before leaving the job site and closing the case. I am tired of the horrible customer support that is given and the poor illiterate technicians that continue to come here and not do full tests of everything for a period of time longer than they are supposed to. This problem is a obvious thorn in my business.The only good they have done for me so far was giving me some back charge credit for the loss of my services and inconveniences. But there should be no reason this should take nearly half a month just to resolve an issue that shouldn't be there to begin with ever since they upgraded our area. One of the technicians told me they had bind all four traffic networks of South Bend and Mishiwaka all together.I don't know what they were thinking, but I went to Michiana College for IT technology and PC repair with computer electronics. I know networking and I build networks for two companies here in the Saint Joseph region.  It is common sense that if your are going to bind four branches together, you must have more powerful servers to handle the in and out bound traffic that happens 24/7 and they obviously made a huge mistake combining their nodes. Now clients all over the Saint Joseph area are trying to connect and request and send data and there is nothing but a bottle neck here.I am not the only one with Comcast issues. I have gone to the Comcast service station at 1920 E. McKinley Ave. in Mishiwaka and there was a self employed gentleman that was furious because of the lousy service he has been getting.I am going to include two logs that I have had with Comcast online representatives that I spoke with. Some of the information you will find shocking and please excuse my language ** , but all of this has caused me to loose operating system build jobs and custom requests for custom PC building to my clients and I have lost clients as well as Mark and I together in an excess damages of an average sale of but not limited too, PC repairs, customs, networking, operations in total loss of an average ($1,200.00 this past two month), data loss for our clients online storage bin, and also not to mention I had to close down my broadcasting radio station and hosting services for two software companies that I serve.I even lost data from sending emails to client and family members. Pictures and other documents have been lost in emails and I have not been able to gain access to government documents for tax season as well as filing taxes and job searching for my god father Frank.I've had loss of sales, data and government data in coming and out going requests. Personal data have failed to be sent and received. The loss of orders due to being unable to connect to Microsoft's servers and IT information servers to get operating system upgrades and other data protocols used to manage with my clients. 
__label__1 August 28th - I contacted Xfinity over the phone to sign up for cable and Internet. I was told that my installation will be scheduled for September 7th. September 4th - I received a letter in the mail stating that a deposit is due. I called Xfinity to make the payment and was told that my appointment on the 7th was cancelled because of an outstanding balance of $292.91 on a previous account. I settled the outstanding balance right away. I was told that instead of waiting on another appointment date, I could go to the local Xfinity service center to pay a $100 deposit and pick up the equipment for self install.September 5th - I went to the Xfinity service center in Camp Creek and was told that they do not distribute the equipment associated with my order because equipment has to be professionally installed and they will mail it to me. I was also told that I owe a deposit of $150, not $100 as I was told previously. I made the payment at the service center and left.I contacted the customer service number to have the equipment shipped to me. Because of the inconvenience, the sales rep signed me up for Internet, cable and home security with a free camera. He also offered me free HBO, Starz, Showtime and Cinemax. He broke the $99 installation fee into three payments to be paid over the next 3 billing cycles. He said that he will try to get me an appointment for 9/8, 9/9 or 9/10 and I would receive a call 24 hours prior to the install techs appointment day. I was happy with his offer and accepted.Later on in the day on a hunch, I checked online to see if the changes to my bundle were reflected. The changes were not there. This worried me because of the previous unpleasant surprises from Xfinity, so I called them again to confirm that the order actually went through. I was told that the bundle was there but my install date is scheduled for October 21st, nearly 2 months after signing up.Why was I given 2 different deposit amounts? When were they planning on telling me about my appointment cancellations and rescheduling? Why didn't the telesales rep know that the equipment had to be installed professionally before sending me to the service center to waste my time? And what's up with this 2 month wait for the installation?I stressed to them that my immediate need is for Internet for school and work. And if they would just give me the modem, I wouldn't have an issue waiting on the other services. I was told that everything has to be installed on the same day. I should also mention that my house is already cable ready and that the previous owners had Xfinity. Their sales rep told me that. This is ridiculous!
__label__1 They demanded over 100.00 dollars for service which they could not provide upfront. Now they are refusing to refund that money. They are not to be trusted and I am now calling the BBB. I gave them this money in good faith to install internet for my son. Now they refuse to refund the money that we had to put onto 2 different credit cards. I have been going in circles now for over 2 weeks. They promise we will have it within 48 hours and they lie and do nothing. The money was all my son had and chose to go without a lot to get service. Now he has not only no food or way to get around as he is disabled and Comcast keeps his money. They talked to me 4xs with no problem. Now today they have an issue?
__label__0 I called Comcast to schedule an appointment to have internet installed on 2/17 between 5 and 8 p.m. On 2/17, I received a call at 4:00 p.m. and I informed the technician that I would be home at 5 p.m. I arrived at 4:45 but no one ever showed up. I called them at 9:30 p.m. and they rescheduled for the following day. They didn't offer any compensation until I said I will just go with Verizon. I talked to 4 different people who put me on hold for long periods of time and finally rescheduled and was compensated with 50 dollar credit. On 2/18, I arrived home at the same time and was scheduled for an appointment between 5 and 8 p.m. I received a call from Comcast trying to sell me other services. I never received a call from a technician and no one showed up.I then called Comcast and was again put on hold for long periods of time. I then spoke with a gentlemen who told me a previous tenant had defaulted on their bill so I would have to show proof of SSN and other documentation. This has been one of the most frustrating ordeals in my life. Everyone gave me different answers and put me on hold. And never did anyone tell me I had to provide a copy of my SSN and other documentation. This is the worst customer service I have ever seen in my life. I am now out over 100 dollars of lost work pay and several hours of frustration waiting for them to install. And then to be told I need documentation because a previous tenant defaulted. This is pretty sad that a large established company can treat people this way and get away with it. I hope there is something you can do to help me. This will be very much appreciated.
__label__1 Comcast provides my business internet and tv through Xfinity. On the website they gave me to log in, under my account it shows my services and one of their services is online streaming and online tv. I have had this for 9 months and it worked fine. According to person on phone they migrated away and no longer provide this service to business customers. However, no reduction fee. When you sign it says the service is provided. When you call unless you press they say it was never part of service for business, and want to ignore the fact their online says it is. FTC should look into this false advertising by a company that nearly has a monopoly.
__label__1 For 7 months (June-Dec) Comcast billed me $7.00/month for a cable modem rental. For 2 months (Jan, Feb) $8.00 for a cable modem rental. I own the modem that they are charging me for. I hadn't realized they had been charging this monthly fee for a modem rental until recently, as I just pay my bill as it's a flat fee and doesn't change. I contacted Comcast (after several hours of frustration of being hung up on and wrong transfers) and they agreed that they should not have been charging me the $7.00 and $8.00 monthly modem rental fee and that I did indeed own the modem they were erroneously charging me for. Comcast said that even though they were in error charging for 9 months, they will only credit me 3 months as its their policy.I have researched and found that this is a wide spread problem with Comcast fraudulently charging its customers for equipment that is customer owned and when customers realize this Comcast refuses to refund the amount owed to the customer. They have also sent a collections agency named Equipment Recovery Services in an attempt to collect the modem that I own and they admit I own. The collection agency calls multiple times a day via an automated dialer and leaves a 49 second automated voice mail message each time.
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer for years. I have not added or discontinued any services; it is the same as before. I have no HD, no extra channels like HBO, Showtime, none of the premium channels. I have 1 DVR and 2 small boxes, internet and landline. These are the only services I carry. My complaint is for the last 8 months, my bill has not been the same amount. Each month, it has been different. Each month, it has gone up except for 1, month 7; it went down after I made a lengthy phone call to Customer Service. The people I spoke to could not explain this or change it back to the lowest price, but the following bill was lower by a few dollars. However, it went back up again on the next bill. I have tried to contact customer service since and I am told they are experiencing higher than normal volume of calls and to try and call back later. I hope we have another cable company coming to town soon. I believe most Comcast customers will switch. I am sure I will.
__label__1 From Oct of 2014 to March 2015 I spent over 11 hours on the phone with this company working out problems that they had messed up on. Staring off their website when I was considering buying has the deal pop up sliding window. They had a deal for $20 month internet. But when you clicked on it it always disappeared and internet deal started at $50-$60 a month and I did not have location devices on my computer while this was happening. And when I called the company asking for the $20 deal, they said there was no such promotion that had ever been going on. So I stupidly still signed up with them and they gave me the wrong equipment. Not only that but they gave me two cable boxes. Which I had to return. They overcharged me three times on my bill. One of the times I spent 2 growling hours on the phone with a payment support agent who told me at the end of the phone call after he could not figure out for two hours what was going wrong with my bill. He said that he could not change it after all that time and that I would have to call back again tomorrow and have them fix the problem. And even when that wasn't happening they had their company's collectors calling me asking me to pay the bill days after it had been payed. I have two addresses that I used internet at. Called to pay on one they say the bill is paid. Then a couple days later my internet is shut off at the one I requested to pay on. When I called to find out what it happened they had paid towards a future billing on the other place and not the place I asked. This kind of incompetent behavior goes on every time you talk to them not to mention that every time I called I would have to speak to a min of 3 different people to get help on a problem. No one knows what they're doing there and they just pass it off to another department which is always the wrong department. I'm not kidding when I say 11 hrs on the phone with them. I kept track after the third phone call in a month. They say I owe them $100 dollars for the last bill. I told them they owed me money for all the bs. I also have the Internet box which I don't even want but I'm not giving them their stuff back if they won't erase my bill. They are an EXTREMELY fraudulent company and should be dealt with. If they offered $1 month Internet it's not worth the stress.
__label__1 On Tuesday, May 7, 2013 at 6:00 pm, my TV Comcast froze on "One Moment Please." After waiting 15 minutes, I made an attempt to call Comcast with a 15-minute wait time. The agent that I was finally connected with had me try several ways of resolving the problem to no avail. She indicated that my box would probably need to be swapped out and set me up with a Thursday appointment, between 8-10 am. She also told me to unplug the TV and that a technician would be calling me back in 45 minutes. After waiting 1 hour 15 minutes, I called Comcast back with another 15-minute wait before I was connected with an agent in South America. She had me jump through the same hoops as the first agent and after being asked for the last four numbers of my SS#, I said I needed to speak with an agent in the US. After another long wait, I was connected to an agent in the Philippines. She started the whole process again and after having her repeat the same instructions over and over, I told her I could not do this anymore (it was now 10:00pm!) and I hung up. Knowing I had a Thursday morning appointment, I decided to wait until then. Thursday morning, I called to confirm the appointment and was told that I did not have an appointment! The agent then again tried to correct the problem to no avail and scheduled an appointment for Friday, May 10 between 4-6 pm. Again, I called that day at 4:45 pm to confirm and that agent insisted on trying to resolve the issue by phone. The technician then called and arrived to correct the problem. He left my residence at approximately 7:00 pm on Friday evening. At 9:59 am Saturday morning, my TV again froze showing "One Moment Please." I called Comcast at 10:15am and it was 1/2 hour before I could get through again being connected to the Philippines! I immediately asked to be connected to an agent in the US because the line was static and I could not understand the agent. She wanted all my personal information and after providing this, she still wanted the last four of my SS# which I refused to provide. She then put me on hold and another agent after a 1/2 hour wait answered the phone and when asked, indicated he too was located in the Philippines. Then he told me that he is not in the department I need and another agent from the Philippines took the call. It is now 11:00 am and she assured me that a technician will be calling me back in 30 minutes! So far, I have been without a TV for 78 hours and have been on the phone for approximately 8 hours trying to resolve this problem.
__label__0 I dad problems with their service since day one! Everything that was on the contract for the agreement was false; they even claimed that it was not from them and that they never came by the house with the contract at all, period. It's all lies! Prices go up all the time! !They are always saying one thing, then never coming through and the changes are always for the worst. They are like most cable companies, a scam, and they need to be stopped. Thank you.
__label__1 I just had a terrible with Comcast customers services. They don't even know know to handle and answer that customers needed. I was on the phone with a very rude guy, his name is **, who working at business department. The way he answered the question and the way he talk was completely rude with no education about the customers services at all. I would not recommend this company to everyone. Please don't use this company, otherwise you gonna get trouble.
__label__1 I am so tired of Comcast. I had to move twice this summer. It was unfortunate but it's something I had to do. When I moved both times my bill was paid. However, when I go online to pay it for the next month there is a bill of $898.07 and there is no breakdown of how my bill actually amounted to that much. My bill is usually a little over $200 a month. So I called and chatted online to see what was going on. And they basically stated that the bill was created from my previous residence. I don't understand how that can be when I paid every month, how do I have a back payment of $420? They refuse to change the bill claiming that everything on my acct adds up to $898. Which is ridiculous because only Comcast can see the breakdown of my bill and I cannot see it on my end. I am so frustrated with this company. They just don't give a crap about the customer period.
__label__1 My cable bill increased and I called to see if I could get a better price without giving up my sports package. After much aggravation I was able to speak with a very nice young lady who lowered my bill slightly. I had to agree to a 2 year contract. At the time I was very happy with Comcast so I agreed. A month later Comcast dropped the YES network, the one channel that I watched faithfully all baseball season. Now I am stuck for 2 years, will not be able to watch my favorite team for 2 seasons. November 5, 2017 will be my last day as a Comcast customer.
__label__0 2/2009 - 181.75; 3/2009 - 96.23; 4/2009 - ; 5/2009 - 83.51. 6/2009 - 84.96; 7/2009 - 85.05  and then...8/2009 - 121.63; 9/2009 - 97.57; 10/2009 - 117.64 I called comcast, yet again. they will credit my account.  When asked what happened, Customer Service didn't understand the billing either.  I do believe this is NOT an honest error, I think this is Comcast being dishonest & hoping customers won't notice. Is there anyway for the Federal Government or some Regulatory Group to Audit Comast billing overcharges?  This is a whole other profit center for them. This cannot be legal.  What recourse is available to overcharged customers?
__label__1 I had been a customer of Comcast for 8 years and until we moved we had not experienced much in the way problems with internet and On Demand. When we moved into our new house we started getting intermittent internet connections. We also started having problems with On Demand access. Every time we had a problem Comcast said they couldn't duplicate it and there was nothing wrong with the service.What finally made me decide to move to another service was that I decided to pay my bill early. It showed as an option on the website even though I was enrolled in Auto Pay. Well a few days later they deducted the payment again from my checking account. When I called they said that I would have had to cancel my enrollment in Auto Pay before paying early. It said nothing about that on the website. It took them 3 weeks to process the refund to my account.I cancelled my service on January 29th. On February 9 they deducted another month's payment from my account. Then they sent me a bill with a credit on it for a partial month rather than just deducting what I really owed them for for the February 9th bill. When I called to see when I was going to get my money back, I was told that it takes 4-5 weeks. That's ridiculous that they will have had my money for a total of 2 months. I would look at other providers first before doing anything with Comcast.
__label__1 I went to Comcast office and I ask if I can pay my final bill but the guy told me that he was going to mail it to me to my new address. I received a bill for $345.00 and I paid that bill because I thought it was my final bill and all of a sudden I found another final bill for 97.36 within two weeks of paying. I called customer service and talked to a guy name Net and explained to him about my reason for calling that I received a letter from credit bureau about the $97.36 and he hanged up on me. I was really surprise and mad that I never even received notice from them that I owe them money. I always pay my bill on time and I don't believe that it was necessary for them to take it that far for only $97.36. BE AWARE OF COMCAST BECAUSE WHAT THEY TELL IS NOT WHAT THEY DO. Make sure to record them when you have them on the phone. 
__label__0 Comcast promised me service at a rate of $44.95 for one year of cable. Every month, they send me my bill with a price of $74.90 plus taxes, for my cable alone. I also have internet and home phone service through them. I call them every month and argue, telling them I did not want my cable at a rate of $74.90. They tried and blamed it on my failure to sign a contract, however, I have signed a contract with them on multiple occasions. Last month, I tried calling Comcast to have my services put into their $99 promotional bundle, and their representative informed me, "you can not get the bundle without paying penalty fees for early cancellation of your contract". Now, here we are, one month later, and my bill is way higher than it is supposed to be, with cable being billed at $74.90. Their reasoning for this is that "you failed to sign and submit the contract".  Sorry, but I feel like they are attempting to scam funds out of me every which way possible. They are dishonest in honoring their service obligations. The contract only seems to be in existence when it is to their benefit.  I can barely pay these bills coming in at such a high rate. My husband is unemployed, and I go to school full-time. Internet is crucial for my success in school, therefore, I must pay my Comcast bill every month. However, I need to spend hours upon hours every month, arguing with these people who call me a liar.
__label__0 Every month my bill has been wrong.  Then my service went down for a long time about a month.  They had credited me.  During the time my service was down they had 3 technicians come out and try to hook up the modem with no luck and left without any of my service working. Then a fourth supervisor tech came out with no luck.  Finally a month and a half later a guy at comcast fixed it on the phone.  We called comcast to ask what the bill would be with our credit.They said $87.00 we went in and paid.not to go back to the beginning but they were double billing me and admitted to it in 2007 for internet for 7 months.  So then we get a $400 bill saying our service was going to be shut off and there was nothing we could do because we were late since december which is not true.  Everyone I talk to is telling me the same thing but I know it is not true.  They make you feel helpless.  My wife would be the contact call her at the home number she can give you all the info.  Please help.  Mu bill should only be $165 to $175. It has never been right since we signed up with them. I want an attorney to contact me.The result is that I will be out almost $500 for no reason.  Please help
__label__1 I have received several call saying I was delinquent with a payment and my services would be shut off. I actually went to my bank and collected proof that the payment in question was actually paid in full. I took this print out to my local Longmont store and showed to a customer service rep. who proceeded to tell me that it was a fake, and that she would remove that charges or the late fees. I now get 5-8 calls per day threatening me and have had to deal with rude Comcast reps on the phone with no end in sight as to a resolution to this problem. Any contacts with them are not noted on my account but I keep records of dates and times.
__label__1 I started having issues with my internet service back in June. I called numerous times to have it fixed and each time someone was able to reset my connection, which would solve the issue for a couple of days but ultimately my connection would be lost again. Finally I made an appointment for a tech to come and check out the problem. I stressed on the phone that I absolutely needed them to come before 7:30 because I needed to leave for work by then. At 8:20 I get a call at work saying the tech was outside my apartment, and I told them there was no way I could be there and I'd been assured he'd be there by 8:30. Whatever, I shouldn't have been surprised and ultimately I ended up solving the issue myself. But sometime during those phone calls an "account manager" (somewhere in an outsourcing center) took it upon themselves to sign me up for television service and a modem rental fee. I have never had more than internet from Comcast and I own my modem.Joke's on me, I guess, for not keeping up with the details on my bill but the saga continues. This past fall money has been tight and I've been throwing Comcast whatever I can afford, whenever I can afford it (bearing in mind they're charging me for a service I do not want and do not even have the equipment to use). This past Tuesday (12/17) I come home to find I have no internet. They'd caught up to me! So I logged into my account and paid off the total Past Due amount ($88) but there's still a balance of $50 or so. I call to see what else I need to do to reinstate service and I'm told once the payment clears there should be no problem. I also speak to someone in billing about the TV & modem rental charges and she confirms, yes, there's no way I could have used it since I've been marked as "picking up a box" since June, and there's no record of me renting a modem. She files a complaint ticket and I'm told I'll have an answer by 12/29 (which in and of itself is pretty weak since it's a cut and dry case of them ripping me off but I'll take what I can get).Anyway, next day (12/18) I still can't activate my service (they told me it should take a few hours...now it's been twenty-four). I call again and someone begins helping me re-link my modem to the account (because it's been erased from my apparently disconnected account). Then I'm told he can't add the modem because I need to talk to billing about reconnecting my account first. He transfers me...the call gets dropped. I call back and this time I'm on the line at an outsourced center, which is a sure sign that nothing is going to be accomplished. I get more scripted lines and I repeat, I've been told that billing needs to reinstate my account since I've paid the past due amount. Billing forwards me somewhere else. I can't even keep track at this point, then someone tells me my account is in collections and I need to call them. What in the world?! I'm not even three months behind and I paid the Past Due amount (which I've been led to believe is enough to reinstate my service). I lose it at this point and demand to speak to a supervisor. She gets on, feeds me more of the same, then puts me on the line with yet another "supervisor". This person now tells me that I need to pay another $27 before they'll reconnect my account.Please bear in mind through all of this that they owe me six months of TV and modem rental fees that I don't even know if I'll see. And I tell her all of this and she keeps repeating the same script to me. "Are you listening to anything I'm saying?" I basically yell at her and she tells me to calm down and they need that $27. This company is insane. My cousin is going to call them tonight because as a young woman in my early twenties who sounds like a teen on the phone....well, I'm not getting anywhere with them.
__label__1 Credit of services not provided but charged - I was called by a Supervisor named Derrick on 11-6-12 and he was following up on problems. He asked if there was an installation and I informed him there wasn't by a tech but by my husband and there was 10 days without service. He agreed to all the above and said we'd be credited $70.00 for the install and $30.91 for the 10 days. I inquired today 11-12-12 with an online chat and was told there was no note from that supervisor on our account to these credits.
__label__1 About 8 channels on my conventional TV (both HD & SD) went blank (black screen). After usual runaround, a technician visits. He fiddled around and left. Next visit on 9/9/13 resulted in swapping cable box, wires, splitter to phone Inet, etc. Assured "problem was outside on pole" and left. NO change in TV behavior. Next visit, 9/12/13. Tech REPEATED all previous steps! Changed cable box, added a new piece of hardware (don't know WHAT it is or for). He also had his eye on my internet/phone service, but I would not let him touch it!He was here 4 hours! (He was very hard to understand verbally). Departed. Result - can't turn TV on or off, can't control volume, DVD player inactive (cannot access start or play). 9/13/13 21:00 hrs first call to Comcast. Assured by person just a matter of remote programming. "He had a little difficulty in getting codes". Would call me back by 22:00 hrs to reprogram remote. Of course, never did. 22:00 approx. 2nd call .Young lady tried best to help. Tried reprogramming remote (she had no trouble getting codes!). No go. NEXT appointment ,9/16/13 09:00 hrs. These are just highlights. Tech #3, during his 4-hour visit, even had to borrow tools from me! Comcast support is a disgrace.
__label__1 Yesterday I was to receive a call from a Comcast service technician that was to walk me through the step so that I may replace the "lost/dropped" emails in my Comcast.net account. That did not happen. This morning I rec'd a call from Comcast, Jacksonville, FL stating they were just placing a follow up call. I stated "Follow Up" from what, no one called. One of the previous service calls had me change my passwords so they could work on the system. They provided me with a new password and locked me out of my old password. I was to wait 24 hours and a technician would walk me through what I needed to do on my side. She stated that none of those directions were applicable... REALLY. She stated that there is no clear way for Comcast to say they could retrieve the emails they lost/dropped in September. Does anyone know any more about the process of recovery, why or what I need to do and WILL I get back my emails? NO real service, fix to problem since Sept 21. HELP.
__label__5 On Feb 28, 2014, I paid my Comcast bill. On March 4, I paid my cell phone and everything was fine. Yesterday, I came home and was told we have no Comcast service, so I call Comcast and a automated voice ask if I have another credit card. It said you have to say yes or no. I waited until I got a hold of a Comcast rep. I was then told there was a system error and to wait for him to correct the problem. He tells me to turn off my phone. I ask him, "Which phone, the house or my cell?" He says my cell phone and that my next payment due is 4-4-14. Now why would Comcast have anything to do with my cellphone service? Once I turned off my cell phone and my Comcast service started up. I think this is very illegal. Why would my cell phone have anything to do with Comcast service? I called Comcast and was blown off. 
__label__0 An installer arrived at my residence at about 2:15pm and attempted to gain entry.  I was not home, but my wife and child were.  My wife was not comfortable letting him in without me there, and she asked me to call Comcast to find out why he was there so early.  After talking with Comcast, a rep told me that she had talked with the dispatcher and the dispatcher instructed him to either wait until the scheduled appointment time, or come back during the scheduled appointment time.  I thanked her.  I get a call about 10 minutes later from my wife saying that the installer did not leave and was knocking on the door again.  I instructed her not to answer, and she told me she was getting scared because he keeps knocking every couple of seconds, and he is knocking really hard like he is angry.  I told my wife to take our son to our bedroom and lock the door.  I instructed her to call the police if she thinks he is going to break in.  I called Comcast again, and explained what was happening.  I asked them to contact the installer and tell him to stop.  My wife on the other line said that she thinks he finally stopped, but was too scared to go downstairs to check.  I came home to find that the installer had left, however I told the Comcast rep, that under no circumstances do I want this installer on my property, and that if they can't get someone else out there today, to reschedule.  I am extremely upset about this.  I know why appointments are made.  If I set an appointment that I cannot make, I contact the other party to reschedule.  I don't show up outside of the scheduled time frame and bang on the door until someone answers.  According to my wife, the installer was very rude and had an aggressive posture when she initially answered the door (only poking her head out).  He rudely told her he had been waiting outside and calling her for over 45 minutes.  We have a gated entrance and I was never called to allow his entry so she was initially confused on he gained access to the property.  He stated he is going to his truck to get equipment, and she closed and locked the door.  She then called him at a number she thought he tried to reach her from and asked him to please wait until I got home.  He then asks her where I am.  It is none of his business where I am and my wife is smart enough to know not to tell a strange man how far away from home I am.  Then he came back to our door trying to gain entry again.  This is unacceptable.  This is not the behavior we expect from a professional company like Comcast.  I realize that this man may be an independent contractor and not an employee of Comcast.  I hope you realize that men like this represent your company poorly and forced us to reconsider acquiring your services.  I would like to be informed in a timely manner of the action you take with this individual, as well as what you plan to do to reconcile with us as your client.  My wife and son were visibly shaken by this incident and my wife and 7 year old jumped when my sister knocked on the door to pick them up this afternoon.  I get a call about 10 minutes later from my wife saying that the installer did not leave and was knocking on the door again.  I instructed her not to answer, and she told me she was getting scared because he keeps knocking every couple of seconds, and he is knocking really hard like he is angry.  I told my wife to take our son to our bedroom and lock the door.  I instructed her to call the police if she thinks he is going to break in.  I called Comcast again, and explained what was happening.  I asked them to contact the installer and tell him to stop.  My wife on the other line said that she thinks he finally stopped, but was too scared to go downstairs to check.  I came home to find that the installer had left, however I told the Comcast rep, that under no circumstances do I want this installer on my property, and that if they can't get someone else out there today, to reschedule.  I am extremely upset about this.  I know why appointments are made.  If I set an appointment that I cannot make, I contact the other party to reschedule.  I don't show up outside of the scheduled time frame and bang on the door until someone answers.

__label__1 I was placed under a contract and didn't know it. Every time I called, my service costs kept increasing and the rep lied to me telling me a bundle service would be less costly. People around the world can't speak English and they are hard to understand. Finally, I was going to transfer service after moving but they shut my service off early and harassed me. They are a 69B company because they lie to consumers!
__label__1 Since the x1 was installed problems started with my recording being lost, shows being only partially recorded on demand. Next day only gave me the same shortened recording. It was extremely slow to respond, so I complained to Comcast and they sent the techs out. When they arrived they tried to do their job for over 2 hours and numerous phone calls back to Comcast. They told me it could not be fixed, that it was a national problem and they were working on it and it should be resolved soon. Nine months later it still does not work and Comcast told me on many occasions to be patient, keep paying my bill and they would give me a credit when it was fixed. Well it still does not work and after doing what they asked, I called back again and told in all good conscience it was unfair to keep paying for service that was not working. They suspended all services after two months, told me I could not get another provider until the past due amount was paid, only make outgoing calls to them and 911. They did tell me I could disconnect service and get a new phone service if I bought new equipment from them and they would import my phone # to the new phone provider. I did that. The associate at Verizon did the switch and said it was all set. When I returned home I attempted to make an outgoing call and received the message from Comcast that the line was suspended. Deeply frustrated and do not know what to do.
__label__1 It's so frustrating to down $250/month to have trouble with service almost 90% of the time. I get anxiety just trying to change channels. Everything freezes and most of the time I get a "we are having trouble connecting to the server" message. Cant wait to switch to another company. Called customer service more than 3 times, get someone on the other end that is clearly reading from a script and has no idea what they're saying.
__label__1 We had a service call scheduled for 12/29/14 between 10 am - noon. When no one showed up or called by 1:00 pm, I called a total of 5 times between then and 6:00. Each time I was told a variation of "the tech only had two jobs this day and he was finishing up the first one and would be to my house in 1.5 hours, within the hour, 45 minutes." On the call at 4:30, I was "guaranteed he would be at my house within the hour". When I called at 6:00, after again waiting several minutes, I was told the tech was "stuck in the mud". I said I wanted to reschedule for January 2nd - 4 days from now, but was told the earliest someone could come was January 3rd. Even when Comcast acknowledges they make a mistake, they won't or can't make accommodations to make up for their mistake. This isn't even my worst experience with Comcast, but I told the rep that if no one showed up on January 2nd, I was removing every piece of Comcast equipment in my house and going with another cable provider. I asked for a supervisor to call me, but was told that wasn't possible. They obviously don't give a damn and all the talk about improving customer service is just that - talk.
__label__1 Back in August of 2014 Comcast stopped sending me my monthly bills thru the mail. I contacted them and request several times for them to send my bills thru the mail. And now it's the end of December of 2014. I have not had any bill thru the mail yet and I had to pay them several times thru my credit card. I contacted them to cancel my service but could not get thru. Comcast kept putting me on hold or cut off my calls. Did anyone experience the same problems? Comcast is very quick to pick up the phone if they know the customer is paying their bills but make it impossible to make a complaint or disconnect their services.
__label__1 I am writing this review to warn people that Comcast will double your monthly charges and justify it. I decided to cut my cable. I don't watch TV a lot and so I didn't see paying for television. I did, however, want to keep my internet. I use it everyday. I was told that my internet cost would be 89.99 a month even though I do not have TV. I can get internet for cheaper from any other provider. Why would they think I would pay that much for internet. Then I looked at their deals online and for internet only it was 39.99. Needless to say I don't think I will go back. I have resolved all of my issues using my cellphone provided (not Comcast/Xfinity).
__label__1 Late for Service Calls: Comcast scheduled a service tech to my address on Thursday, 29 Mar 2012, between 07:30 AM and 08:30 AM. The service tech was an hour and 15 minutes late and didn't install the additional line in a back bedroom that was requested on the initial work order that I placed on Wednesday, 28 March 2012. No one from Comcast called to advise me that the service rep would be an hour and a half late. I had to contact Comcast to inquire as to what happened and why the service tech was not on time. Comcast offered to send a service tech later that same day but I would have to remain at home all day to wait for a tech to arrive. I told them that I was not going to wait at home all day for a service tech to show up, especially when he didn't install the line when he did show up an hour and a half late.I asked the customer service rep to re-schedule the tech for the next day, Friday, 30 March 2012, at the same time between 7:30 AM and 8:30 AM, which she did. I got two calls before 7:30 AM to confirm that I was home and was assured that the tech would be there. I received a call at 8:33 AM on Friday, 30 March 2012, from the Comcast Dispatch stating that the tech would not be at my house until 9:45 AM, which is now 2 hours and 15 minutes late, an hour later than when he showed up on Thursday, 28 March 2012. This lateness by techs is unacceptable. I am appalled at having to wait on techs when I'm paying for their service and I shouldn't have to wait all day for a tech to show up for a pre-scheduled service call. I didn't call at the spur of the moment. I called the day before I needed the service. Management should be concerned because I'm sure that I'm not the only dissatisfied customer with this 'crappy' service that Comcast heaps on it customer. Do something about this now!
__label__1 If the service would be reliable, I could possibly give 2-3 stars. I have experienced daily outages at any time of the day. I pay for service so that I can turn on my Smart TV and watch cable TV or use the internet when it is convenient for me. The repeated outages totally prevents convenience and the experience of enjoying the service. I believe Xfinity is only using temporary fixes for the outages instead of actually creating or replacing equipment for a permanent fix. It doesn't mater if it rains or shines, the service is temperamental.
__label__1 I recently tried to switch to Comcast from AT&T to get faster internet speed. I ordered the self install kit which I was supposed to be able to plug in and login to activate with current service lines... That didn't work. I called to have it installed by one of their technicians; When I went to setup my Smart TV to connect to the WiFi it wouldn't connect. After spending 2 hours on the phone troubleshooting I was told it was the TV and I would need to contact their troubleshooting department. What kind of service can't connect the WiFi to a TV? I called to then cancel the service. I don't have the time to have them keep coming out to correct it when it should have been done at the time of install. After all that's said and done I was billed $125 for what... No service and a huge headache. Absolutely unbelievable. When I called to question why I was billed it was for the service (that I never had). I will not recommend Xfinity to anyone for any reason. AT&T has great customer service and they're reliable. I wish a little faster internet but I will take it any day over dealing with Comcast Xfinity ever again.
__label__0 After 3 years of being a loyal Comcast customer, I called to cancel my cable TV but keep my internet. The girl informed me that there would be a $25 disconnection fee plus I have to hand deliver their cable boxes and modems. The woman on the phone didn't seem to care about my business or doing anything to make the situation right. Even when I told her I would be taking my business to WOW. I said I'm trying to cut back my expenses and all Comcast is doing is overcharging for everything. I don't feel I should have to pay this fee. But out of fear of damaging my credit, I will reluctantly pay it. 
__label__1 Since July 27 2014 I have had nothing but issues dealing with your company. I have reached out to you and it continues to serve as no help. It all began when I was going to cancel services that Sunday because I was paying too much and the 300 gb data cap. Not sure if any of you all have kids that require service for school, but I do. Which means we need data. We have not once gone over, but I was looking into going back to school myself. Well if I could have got my cap increased. Anyway, so I make a call to Comcast. The lady was real nice, sold me on the x1 digital preferred plus, 105 tier internet with unlimited data and the phone, for under 150 a month for 1 year. Great, let's do this. Scheduled an appointment for Wednesday. I don't know why but I felt like it was too good to be true. Well I researched it and it turned out that you all don't offer unlimited data. But I saw locations that offer 600 gb. I called back on Monday, explained what I found. The lady was like, "yeah we don't do unlimited data." She was like, "We do have the 600gb that comes with the 105 tier." I was like "Great." I asked her "check and make sure it was all in the system correctly." She said it was not. She said they didn't include the internet. She said she fixed it. Tuesday rolls around and since there was already 1 error and already been misinformed once, thought I would just verify. Lady got on the phone confirmed all the information, I confirmed the 600 gb. Everything was ready to go. Wednesday, tech shows up 2 minutes late, not too bad, looks at the paper work as "I oh can't do nothing, codes are wrong." Makes a couple calls and leaves. So I call again, Jim was like, "Yeah codes are all wrong," said, "no problem, we will get them fixed and get a tech back out to you." He told me had to put the schedule in for Monday just to hold a time. Went over what I had ordered and confirmed the data limit of 600gb. Said he was giving it to his supervisor so we could rush a tech out, plus just to make sure he got all incorrect codes off.Thursday rolls around, no word so I call, said no tech was available today, maybe Friday. Said ok, had representative confirm what was ordered. Had her confirm the data cap. She said 600. Friday arrives. No word. I called and explained this needs to be done today cause otherwise will increase the proration and cause me a double bill. She said would take Care of that. Had her confirm the account again and what was the data cap? 600. Said ok. Saturday, no tech confirmed at all. Sunday, I took a day off from dealing with Comcast. Monday arrives, tech showed up, and was only going to install the internet. Explained no supposed to be internet and x1. He agrees to go and get a box. Finally all installed. Finally. Well wish that was the end. That night pulled up my data cap info, still reporting 300. Figured maybe it takes 24 hours to update. So I look the next morning, still 300. Called and was told all those. People I spoke to were wrong. Asked for a supervisor, I got with "attitude will not do you any good." Will tell you the same thing. I said ok. Reached to corporate, nothing but, "sorry and we will take care of teaching," but not happening. Even at 1 point Yolanda with corporate was like, "Yeah you are a part of the 600gb data area." 2 hours later, "sorry, no you're not." Plus the internet is no faster and constantly drops. They sent a Tech out and that night. It was great. Next day same thing. COMCAST, I am calling you out. I have given you the chance to honor what was promised. I have listen and defended for years. You have promised a better Comcast and better customer service. Here is your chance to deliver what your people have promised. Not asking for anything but was promised, if can't make it happen in residential, give me my package as a business customer. Do whatever is necessary. Now you all will not even return my call. So Comcast, here is your chance to prove you are that company you claim to be. Brian Roberts CEO, this is your company, make changes. Also someone truly fix my internet. I am starting to think it is being done intentional because you want to get back at me for calling you out on promises you have yet to deliver. But I don't think it's a conspiracy. Just think most of your reps are incorrectly trained and have no empowerment. But what does Brian Roberts care, it's not affecting his paycheck. 8/22/14, now corporate will not even return my call.
__label__1 I moved to my new address in August. I even upgraded my service. Right from the start I was lied to. I didn't get the service they told me I was going to get. When I call the next month after getting my bill, all I was told that it was a training opportunity for the Rep in the loyalty department. Sorry, but she had no right to offer you that. Since then my bill changes every month. I was getting free Stars.. then was charge for it, even though I was told I can get additional free service cause of all the misrepresentation I was receiving. I didn't want to argue about it, pick up different service, pay for it for a month - cut it off was charge 2.99 for changing service and wasn't told that I would be charge. When I gotten my service I was told it would be 99 dollars a month (triple play) an additional 10 dollars for extra channel. My total bill with taxes will be 151.43. Now when I get my bill its 183.88- They spoke of prorate cost of service that I was getting and that the triple play wasn't offer. I was told by James the supervisor that I was getting a discount for a month to go paperless. I explain that wasn't true. He was suppose to listen to the calls and call me back. That never happen. He even threaten my saying some of the adjustment (that I already had to fight for will be put back on my bill if he find out they are not true). Go ahead listen I wasn't worried cause Comcast Rep's lied from the beginning. And today I just wanted to down grade my service and I'm being told by an Rep overseas that if I do, I have to sign up for an 24 month contract. NO... that isn't what I originally sign up for. I was given the triple play now you telling me I can't have it cause I want to remove the 10 addition and two adapters - What is the problem. Comcast customer service lies, they don't follow through and they keep raising the bill. Every month I have to call them about my service since I move to my new address. Every month they gotten it wrong and nobody in their office is trying to take the time and correct it. It's more to the sorry..being that its every month.. it just now I'm having problems with downgrading my service. I made a huge mistake in keeping Comcast when I moved!
__label__1 Trying to have Comcast set up my internet was beyond frustrating. It took them 2 weeks to get to my house the first time. Then another 2 to come back to fix it because they couldn't install the first time. Even after the 2nd time they still couldn't set it up. They always said they would call back and never did. Finally after the 2nd time of coming and saying they would have to reschedule then never called me back, I finally called them myself, spoke to at least 6 different people for over an hour and still got no answers as to when it would be fixed. I ended up canceling the entire thing out of pure frustration. Needless to say  I will never go through them again.
__label__1 Well I order cable and internet thru Comcast first time customer. A rep said "yes we service in your area and set a appointment up." The tech came out looked around and said we don't service in your area. So I asked him why they did not tell me that they took a $200 deposit when my credit is very good. Did not know why needed a deposit they said it was for the equipment. I told him that he said well they should of never took a deposit. They put it on the bill so now I am mad so he left. I called the 1-800 number talked to a lady who made me talk to 5 other people. Finally got a manager on the phone. Told her everything and she said "We will send you a check. It will take 6 to 8 weeks." So it took 30 seconds to take me money but it will take 8 weeks to get it back in a week. I know we are in 2015 and I don't ever use checks and why can't you just put it back on my card so the lady put me on hold and came back and said "OK I put it thru. It will be back on your card in 3 days." Well a week goes by nothing so I called back went thru 6 different people again and on the phone for 3 hours and a man comes on and says nothing has been sent thru. It is pending. So I asked to talk to someone else a lady came on she said "Nothing is pending. It has never been set up and they only send checks out." So if I have to wait do I get late fees sent to me as well? I know if I was late on a bill I would have late fees. Now they should give me something for all this bull crap. No nothing.. 6 weeks later nothing yet. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST AT ALL COST!!!
__label__1 Comcast is responsible for canceling the tv series (EUREKA). I truly hope they lose any and all customers, I want nothing to do with them!
__label__0 I found my bill went up in Oct. 09, so I called. I was told very rudely that my "specials" were over. When I said it was wrong that "new" customers were given better deals, and their regular customers nothing, I was told very sarcastically that I was already paying less than many and there was nothing that could be done. In Dec. I was looking at my upcoming bill and saw it was being raised again. From Sept. to Jan. my bill went up $50 between the 2 increases. I also asked why I had a charge on the bill for "blast" speed, when that was not asked for, but was told by Comcast it was being given to their customers. Again, another entrapment, they "give" it to you for a period of time, then start charging.The store to return equipment is not conveniently located, and the wait is 45 minutes or more. Also, they owe me money and claim it is going to take 8 to 12 weeks. When I asked why so long, I got a cock and bull story about how the program is out of the area; it is only run once or twice a month, then has to be put into an envelope and mailed. Please, do they think we are stupid? Yes they do. With a bill of $170 a month, I got rid of Comcast, but feel their business practices are illegal. I spent a lot of time trying to reach them on the phone, and had to deal with rude people.
__label__1 I took the day off to have Comcast do an installation. They offered a great deal for $99. I have been a DirecTV consumer for several years. They have great service, but their billing is not customer-friendly. I waited all morning for Comcast to show and called customer service at 10am; my appointment was between 8am-10am. First, I was told to be patient; they will be there. I waited another hour, and called the local office, only to find out they did not show an appointment for me. I told them to cancel, and I did not appreciate that they cost me money and wasted my time. A few days later, I got a call from Comcast to see how my service was. I thought it was a joke, and I explain the no show. After a few weeks, I called again and was convinced that this was not their normal service; once again, I agreed. It was to be installed today, which I once again took the day off for. The technician showed up, minus part of the equipment. He wanted to go ahead and install, but I said no; that partial installation was not acceptable. He called his boss and said that I cancelled. I told him I did not cancel; he needs to make arrangements to get the equipment needed to complete the job. He said it was an hour away, and he could not do that. I cannot understand why an installation technician would not carry equipment on his truck. I called customer service and was put on hold for 45 minutes. I got transferred around and disconnected. I called back again only to get someone who could hardly speak English and was placed on hold for another 36 minutes. I was, again, transferred around and was told they would be here again today before 3pm. I was told that a customer service manager would call me; I have yet to get that call. It's 4pm and no one has showed up; not a phone call as well. I will keep my DirecTV and pay the additional $20.00 a month and tell Comcast what they can do with their service if a manager ever calls me. Im not sitting around waiting for that.
__label__5 Over the years, I have had half a dozen different internet service providers. The most inconsistent internet signal and unhelpful technical support has been, by far, courtesy of Comcast. Rarely will I go more than an hour without having internet service slow to next-to-nothing or drop out completely. I have tried contacting customer service, but their "solutions" seem like they are just buying time to drop a charged service call on you that I would never expect to make anything better. Since everyone I know that uses Comcast has the same connectivity issues as I do, I'm going to use some deductive reasoning and conclude that the service is just bad and nothing will ever be done about it as long as they are the only high-speed internet service option. Enjoy your horrible reputation and piles of cash, Comcast.
__label__1 Over charge every month. Crooks. Thiefs. $50 to $80. I have to call them every month.
__label__0 I have not had concistent cable service for over a month - long before Hurricane Ike. I have made MANY calls, explaining my story over and over, hace MANY techs come to look at the problem, and NOTHING has been solved. Every person I speak with says something completely different and nothing gets resolved. They are an incredibly inept organization. And did I mention the NUMEROUS supervisors I have asked to speak with that are never available and NEVER return my messages!I have missed work to meet their unreasonable and unrelaible appointment scheduling, have had no-shows, and absolute frustration!
__label__0    I have been contacting them for over two months to remove a low hanging cable wire that all other utility companies say belong to them.They continue to make promises but no action.I had to get upon the roof and tie it up so that it will no longer hang.It continues to fall low enough to cause harm.
__label__1 cable company to be allowed to mislead seniors, take advantage of us. Need help in resolving this.
__label__1 We recently moved. We planned ahead and contacted Comcast prior to the move. We told them we wanted service cancelled and connected on the same day at the old and new locations. So far so good. When the day of the move came, our technician came to install our cable. Our internet transfer was not on the "ticket" and this is where one of many issues began. Our signal was 'too weak' according to the technician and he needed to return. Our technician left with incomplete cable service and no internet.That evening, I called into customer service to potentially troubleshoot to see maybe it would get fixed. This customer service rep informed me that a technician is scheduled to come the following day, however I did not need to be present as it was outside work. The next day, the original technician did not return, however, I did receive a call informing me that a technician was knocking on my door. Remember, I was told that I was not needed to be present. So they rescheduled. I call into customer service again and tell them what happened. Again I am informed that I do not need to be present. 4 days pass and a technician is scheduled to come between the hours of 8 am - 8 pm and that I would need to be present. When I called into Comcast at 8:05 to inform them that the tech was a no show, they said, a tech was at your home. "Uhh, what? No they were not." After it was escalated for a THIRD time, I was told that a tech would come on Sunday between 8 am - 8 pm. I called into Comcast just to double check. They informed me that no appointment was scheduled for Sunday but another appointment was scheduled for Monday. While I appreciate that every CSR has been apologetic for my experience, I have yet to see resolution. Own up to your mistake and do not lie to your customers as you have 3 times with this one.
__label__1 We have Comcast's Xfinity cable and high speed internet and for a while it was working fine. Then all at once the internet was insanely slow, and the cable TV service could not get a signal. We called and asked for a technician to come out, and they said it would be over a week. With me taking 3 online bi-term classes this is difficult. We decided to troubleshoot the issue ourselves while we waited and bought a cable, and bypassed different connection points on the line outside and inside, and found that the problem was with a 15 foot stretch of cable between 2 splitters. We told the technician where we found the problem in the cable line and asked for it to be replaced because that was the issue. He refused to replace the stretch of line and replaced a part of the line that was working properly instead.We ran the cable diagnostic test after he left, and discovered that our signal strength was the exact same as before. Needless to say we are furious. We called back and explained our concern, and they said I would be another week before they could send anyone to check out the issue. 3 weeks later now no one has been back and the connection is still awful. The cable TV is spotty and loses connection, and the high speed internet is running slow, or is not even working at all. I am a semi-professional counterstrike player, and I had to explain to CEVO why my internet wasn't working and why our team was forfeiting the match so it wouldn't count against our record. Long story short, Comcast please get your crap together. There is a reason you are rated 1 of 5 stars. And that's because we can't rate you as a 0.
__label__1 When I moved to our new home I was not aware that Comcast service was not available in my neighborhood. Which forced me to cancel my Comcast subscriptions since I was not able to receive Comcast services (I was very satisfied with the services provided). Now the sticky part it seems that Comcast is dictating where I can live if you have an existing Comcast service contract. If you happen to move to a neighborhood that is not serviced by Comcast you have to pay an outrageous cancellation fee. Mine was $756.82.
__label__1 I have gone to the Comcast building several times but I'm so tired of the staff treating me bad. I ask to speak to a supervisor but they tell me they are the supervisor. We are all human, they have a regular job just like me and don't think it's fair to be treated like that. I have tried calling but there's no one available. But would really like for a higher staff at Comcast do something about the staff.
__label__5 My service was interrupted for non-payment due to unrelated expenses for family member passing away. When I arrived back home a week later I paid the outstanding bill. A month later I received my bill and saw the extra charges. I decided to call Comcast. I spoke to a customer service representative about getting credit for the two weeks my service was suspended. Comcast bills a month in advance so I feel I did not have service for two weeks that I should not have to pay for service I did not receive. The response I received was that I still have service I just do not have access to the service.I was charge a reactivation fee for each service. $5.00 for phone, $5.00 for internet and $2.00 for the TV plus I pay $200.00 plus a month. Comcast will not credit me the two weeks which is $100.00, $7.00 late fee and $12.00 reactivation fee that is a total of $119.00 Comcast has made for service I did not have access to. Comcast is doing this to all the customers that have had their service suspended for a week or two.Comcast has 22.9 million cable customers, 16.7 million high-speed Internet customers, and 8.4 million voice customers. If 3,000 customers have had their service suspended for two weeks that would be $300,000.00 Comcast has received from people who are struggling to pay their bill. Then if this happens every month whether it be the same customers or to different customers, Comcast now has a great business model on how to charge for services to customers without providing service to your customers. I must say that is a great way to make a profitable business but how can anyone trust a company like this. They charge you for a cup of coffee but all you get is an empty cup. You can see the coffee pot but you cannot reach it from the other side of the counter. You can still have coffee but you just don't have access to it.
__label__1 What Refund???!!! Jan 2016 decided we had enough with Comcast and switched to AT&T/DirecTV. 1-25-16: Sent all hardware by UPS back to Com - 5 pieces. 2-5 received statement saying I have a 61.58 refund. 2-9-16: Called in about refund. CSR Fatimah of Fla says they DID receive ALL 5 parts, AND that I have a refund of 181.58, which will be SENT OUT in 2 wks. 3-17-16: I called and Gabriel/Billing ID ** says refund WAS NOT PROCESSED, that she will submit today, take 6 wks. 4-6-16: I called 'to check' on status. Mike ID ** says he can't find ticket of 3-17 or 1-25. Finally after 15 min, finds Gabriel ** notes of 3-17. Creates ticket #** to confirm that after talking to Super, that ck for 181.58 would be sent out in 3-5 DAYS, NOT WEEKS. 4-26-16 at Noon: Asked for super in US, got Esperinza ID #** in Philippines! She checked notes and finds my calls of Feb, March, April 6th. HOWEVER, now she says that they didn't receive all the equip and were holding up my ck. She couldn't give me answer as to why I wasn't made that know on 4-6 call. However, when I quoted her the serial numbers of equipment, UPS tracking Number, and UPS receipt # (that fortunately I had kept) - she quickly created a new ticket #**, of which we did receive an email stating it had been created which we had not gotten in previous calls. However, now she says that it will take another 7 days for review of matching the UPS receipt with what equipment they received. (She and I had matched up all serials numbers on the equip, with UPS receipt.) THEN it will take another 7-14 days after that to 'cut the check'. (Now on the phone for 1 hr 7 min at this point.) Asked her how often do they train them on how to lie to a customer... I then asked her again for 3rd time for a Supervisor, the one who would approve a pay raise for her... on hold for 20 min... 'all the Superv are on a conference call right now'. I reminded her that's what I heard 1hr 22 min ago. She 'set me up' to have a real Superv call me back in 90 min. Stay tuned.
__label__0 To save money I cancelled the Comcast internet service. Instead of my bill going down $45 dollars it went up $50. They told me that my price went up because I cancelled one of the services. If I want my bill to go down I need to have, cable, internet and phone provided by them. In some places this is called black mail.I need cable for my work, I'm self employed, I don't know for how long I can afford this. Without same cable programs I can't do a proper job.
__label__1 Exactly the second day of every month, I paid Comcast from my bank account $19.99, the agreed price for monthly internet service. I never missed a payment. After a year, they suddenly sent me a statement saying, without any explanation, I have an overdue balance of $88.38 in April, 2015. I disconnected the service. Then in May they sent me a second bill and the overdue payment became $187.28. When the third bill came, the balance became $100.72.How can I take them seriously? Customers are not money cows to milk the way they want and I have to pay whatever came out of their mouth. Behind the MCI-style billing there is only one possibility. $88.38 was too small an amount for any debt collectors to buy so they blew it to $187.28. Then they felt it might be too much for me to pay, so now they have reduced it to $100.72. This way they are prepared either for this sucker to pay or sell it the collection agency.Many online reviews tell me they are dishonest because they don't tell you the whole truth in doing business. They are arrogant because they think they can subdue you by threatening. They are despicable because they would pound all over you if they think they have a chance. Let me be clear. If I am not convinced with their explanation, they don't get one more penny from me. I need to publicize this experience.
__label__5 I had no internet connection due to an outage in our area. I called Comcast to establish a new connection. They gave minimal internet connection, referred me to Signature Support as they did not fix this issue, and charged me $39.95. I called to cancel twice within 24 hours and twice after 24 hours. They refused to give me a confirmation number for my cancellation. Comcast is the ISP and is responsible for my having an internet connection, yet they tried to bill me when this all stemmed from their initial outage.
__label__1 The rep who handled my claim put my office building address down as my service address even though I told them the correct address multiple times. So when technicians arrived on install date they refused to install since wrong service address was on file. They also had all of the wrong equipment and were prepared to install the incorrect cable package (the rep and I agreed to a different one). So I was told to go to a Comcast service center and when you call there you are once again dealing with a automated system that directs you to more CS reps. Not anyone at the actual location so I can't be professional and set up a appointment. So now I run the risk of not being able to talk to anyone about my issue when I go into the service center. I HAVE NEVER DEALT WITH A MORE PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE SYSTEM IN MY LIFE. Is passing elementary school the only prerequisite for becoming a customer service rep at Comcast? Putting down a correct address would seem to be a pretty high priority but I guess that's too much to ask for. If my mother hadn't run up a 600 dollar debt from AT&T in my name when I was 19, I would have went with them days ago. Truly a horrible experience.
__label__1 For several days I went online and checked out Comcast and what they offered. I did a live chat session with one of their representatives. During the chat I asked for them to tell me exactly what additional charges and fees would appear on my bill. She told me that there was a $80.00 fee for one-time installation charges -- a $50.00 professional install and a $30.00 install fee for new outlet. At that time I told her I was not interested in switching to Comcast due to the 2 install fees. A day later a representative called my cell phone to discuss why I did not want to continue with Comcast. I explained the fees issue. He told me that the install fees will be waived. I told him I did not trust that they would be waived. He told me that he would send me a email that shows the fees would be waived, which he did. The email shows one-time fees $0.00, along with the breakdown of my bill and my install appointment time.When the tech was done with the installation he asked me to sign the completion order, which was on a iPad. As I scrolled up to see what it said, I saw where all these fees were added. I questioned him about it. He replied that they were standard on all install orders and because I have the email showing the cost is too $0.00 that it is already in the system and I will not see the charges it on my bill. That was a lie. All them charges were on my bill. When I called Comcast they told me they showed no notes saying that I was to receive free install, and that the tech was the one who was supposed to remove them charges. Since when does a technician decided what goes on a customer bill??? As I continued to explain that I have a email form your company that I was not to be charged, she told me, "Well I don't see a email saying that, therefore I will not remove the charges." I offered to send her the email from her company saying the fees will be $0.00. She told me to take copies to a XFINITY store and talk to them about it. So even though I have in writing that the install fees would be $0.00 they will not honor their own word!!! Be advised that Comcast will not keep their word, even if you have it in writing from them.
__label__1 I move from Florida on end March. By April 15 I was leaving in Sealy, Texas. 3 months later I have a collection company calling me. Comcast is charging for equipment and two months of service June and July. I keep calling to fix the problem, no help. They keep saying that I never call to disconnect the service. The equipment was return to Comcast by UPS. They charging me $537.37 on equipment and service. Also I was talking to the technician and he told me I never pay for cable so ask how is that, he respond was I charge my service for cable to the people with money they never look the bill? To me that was incredible. So we have this people charging others for service.
__label__1 The saga continues. First about 2 years ago when my area changed to digital Comcast refused to send anyone to install the converter boxes on my add sets. Thane insisted that I come to their office to pick them up. They finally mailed them and on my next bill they added shipping charges after telling me that I would have 2 free of charge since I needed 3. They billed me for the shipping on all of them. After going to DISH Network over this I returned to Comcast a little over a year ago. Starting 2 days after the install I began losing sound and had to change channels to get the sound back. After 8 service calls I gave up and lived with it. Now the service shuts down. Locks on one channel and if you try and change channels it tells you to unplug and reboot the converter. When you do you lose all service for a couple of hours. They offered me an appointment after 40 minutes on hold for 4 days.  Later after asking for a supervisor I was promised a 9-12 appointment the next day. I waited for the 3 hours and the technician was a no show. When I called in I was told the ticket was still open then told that it was closed with no one home and then that it was closed but with no notations. There were no notes for a not home call. They had my cell and there was no calls at all that morning on the contact number they were given. After another 20 minutes on hold they would do a call back and someone from the area would call me. The customer service rep said she would call me back within an hour. Guess what neither the local office or the customer service rep called. Did I expect anything different. The service goes out yet they still charge you for 100% of it. 
__label__1 I have been having issues with my internet gateway (supplied by Comcast) for over a year. At least twice each day my gateway loses the connection and does a total reset. Not only does this interrupt my internet connection but also my phone service. Multiple times I have been on important telephones with clients only to have my phone service go dead. Not to mention all the times I have been using the internet for work and have it untimely disconnect. Over the past 12+ months I have made approximately three dozen calls to their support center and have had a dozen plus technicians come to my home. Unfortunately each time a technician is scheduled, I need to be home to wait for them. Unfortunately, none of the technicians have resolved the issue. The last time a supervisor came, changed a few wires, and gave me his number ** to call if I was still having issues. After placing 3 calls to him over the past 2 weeks he has not returned my call. Two people from their corporate office called and gave me their numbers. The first number (800) 597-6022 x-** has not returned my call after me leaving numerous voice messages. The second person (800) 597-6022 x-** at least answers her phone, however she has not been able to get the service supervisor to return my call.I don't think I am asking for too much. All I want them to do is resolve the issue. They can start by returning calls. Further attempt to resolve the issue by refraining from sending the same skill level technicians to my home. If the first 11 technicians with the same skill level could not resolve the issue what makes them think the 12th technician with the same skill level will do any better! It is really poor and unacceptable customer service when multiple calls to different company representatives are not returned.
__label__0 I received a letter on 7/17/09 stating, "Our records indicate you are currently receiving full access to Comcast's On Demand service which extends beyond the scope of what your Cable TV subscription allows. As a Standard with Premium customer, you will no longer have full access to On Demand effective August 25, 2009." It then states they have a "variety of package options available to choose from." The bottom of the letter offers an "Upgrade to Digital Preferred package" at an unspecified cost. Our present package is called "Digital Premier" There are no specifics anywhere. What are we getting that we're not supposed to? Why the change now after 3 years as a subscriber at $179.56 per month.I called the 800 number, spoke with "Randell". She stated we were only the 2nd customer to call on this. I asked her the above questions. She said she had no answer. I pressed the issue, asking, "How can you take away something without saying what it is? You must know what you are going to remove." She put me on hold to talk to her supervisor. She came back on to say "We think it may be Howard Stern." As rude as it may sound, I had to laugh. "Please take him - but I can't believe what you're saying". She said they were just guessing and no one knew what the letter was about.Comcast has a cable monopoly here in Stockton. We cannot get satellite as we are in an apartment complex and trees block access. I firmly believe that we are targeted for this as the letter we got was addressed to Philip ** or current resident. Our account is in my name and has been for over 3 years. Why the "or current resident"?
__label__1 By far, the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I have sent multiple emails to corporate with no response. I have had issues ongoing for over 2 years without resolve and Comcast has still not effectively credited my account. FURIOUS CUSTOMER here. I have been told for the last 2 years a credit would be applied backdated to the date the issues started, to the date of resolution and have received $60 worth of credit. For 2 years of bad service, I have lost a job and countless hours at my other job because of these issues and Comcast has yet to resolve the issues. I am beyond frustrated at this point as I have made countless phone calls and sent numerous emails. Clearly, nobody gives a **. I want this properly rectified and I want it done NOW. You can message me. I will post this on every social media forum I can find.
__label__0    Since I signed up with Comcast 3 years ago. I have never been able to recieve all the channels I should be getting. It started with having to have 3 service people out the first day to install the digital box and internet. They left and it still was not working. It took a week for them to finally get it up and running. Only to break down again a week later. They have had the cable to the apartment replaced, They have replaced my converter box several times. When the system goes down it takes a week for them to come out and fix it but I have never recieved any credit. I am tired of paying for service I do not get. I live in an apartment and I am not allowed to have Direct tv installed.There has to be a way to stop this monopoly from doing what it is doing. Previous to this I actually moved out of comcasts area just to get away from them. Due to pressures of the commute I had to move back into there area. I have complained to the local ombudsman but they just gave the complaint to comcast and they did nothing about it. I hate this countries love of law suits but the more I deal with this company I can see that someone needs to put this company out of businessPrevious to this I actually moved out of comcasts area just to get away from them.

__label__1 My rental apartment has a contract with Comcast therefore I have no option to select another company. I am contracted for 2 years; not optional. For the past 5 months I have had repairman after repairman come to my home. I don't know these men and have stated to Comcast enough is enough with the guys coming to my home; I'm a single female. These men get comfortable, text, tell you their divorce woes and so on. How long before I run into the one who's decided to check out and me with him (have you read the papers lately?). The odds keep growing. I have had 5 repairmen and 1 repeat to so call fix my service. My service is out yet again and they want me to take more work leave atop of my $208.00 bill every month. Leave is not an option. I must wait 7 complete days to have yet another repairman fix my problem. So this is what America has become; big business can screw up my credit if I don't pay yet the little guy must pay for that which she does not get. I work hard for my $ yet my sweat benefits corporate America. They get 100% of their $ and a % of mine for no service rendered.
__label__1 August 21, 2011 (2:30-3PM): I return to my residence to find that my TV (both receivers) were inoperative and an error message appears "Service is temporarily unavailable, channel will be back shortly" (not verbatim, but along those lines). I figured it was something temporary and did not mind the wait (nor did I know how long it has been like this since I was not at my residence for a few hours and it was working before I left). I also attempted to log on to the Internet which was also not available as well.August 21, 2011 (4:29PM): After a few hours, there was still no service so I called Comcast. I used the system to attempt to "refresh" my units and nothing took place. After which, I contact Comcast again to speak to a representative. The first rep. was with the cable portion and attempted to troubleshoot. He was unsuccessful. I informed him I had a modem as well and it was not working. He said he wanted to send me over to the Internet department for that could be the cause of the issue and once that is fixed, the cable should work as well. I accepted.I was transferred to  Nick of the Internet department. Nick went through the "standard" procedure on helping troubleshoot the system. All in all, he stated it seems to be an issue with the outside line and he had to send a technician out to the residence. He placed me on hold to find the "earliest appointment" and returned with "I can have someone out there for you on the 1st". My response in return was "The 1st of what, for I know you are not saying September which will make this 2 weeks of no service". He informed me that was the earliest, or it would not be until September 26th.I proceeded to explain to Nick that this was unacceptable. I can understand 2-3 days, but Comcast wants people to await 2 weeks to regain service -- service that has already been paid for. So in a nutshell, Comcast can take my money with no issue, but cannot render servicesNick then stated he will place this on an "expedite" and I asked him what does that mean, that service will take place between now and September 1st. He explained that someone will be in contact with me within 24 hours on this level.August 22, 2011 (11:06AM): I called Comcast and spoke with a rep. named Ian. I explained to Ian that I was not going to be able to be without service for 2 weeks and have Comcast interfere with my money. I explained to Ian what happened on the day before, he pulled the notes. I said fatuously "You all act like there are no resources available for these service calls", in which I was informed by Ian "Yes Ma'am, it is due to lack of manpower that we are on schedule like this". I mentioned to Ian, "I was truly joking when I said that for all the people out here that need/want jobs, you are telling me that Comcast is not trying to fill those jobs to provide better service."Either way, after a nice discussion, Ian stated he was going to see if he can schedule me for cancellations throughout the day and will call me between calls when he is able to move me up. He did call back one time and moved me from September 1st to August 29th. I thanked him. He said he would continue to see what he can come up with the rest of the day.August 23, 2011 (1:53PM): I called Comcast and spoke with a rep. named Tony. I explained to Tony the same situation that was denoted by Nick and Ian. He reviewed the records and said he will see if he can find a cancellation. Over the duration of our conversation, he was able to move me from August 29th to August 27th. I informed Tony that this was still unacceptable, but thank you for working with me and I will call back to see if there are any other cancellations (since now it seems as though I have to do Comcast job for them and I do not even work for them. I am not able to perform my task for the company I do work for since Comcast does not provide service for those who have paid for it).August 23, 2011 (~5PM): I checked my voice mail to receive a call from Comcast stating my schedule appointment is for Saturday, August 27th.August 23, 2011 (5:08PM / CALL DURATION: 10 mins and 13 secs): I called Comcast and spoke with a rep. named "Marg/Marge" (for this rep. did not take any notes, record the conversation and most likely she was from one of your outsourcing companies -- as I was informed by Cathy/Kathy). I explained to "Marg/Marge" the situation and was calling to see if there were any cancellations available so that I can be placed in that slot. She wanted to know how she could assist, and I informed her once again, I was calling to find out if there were any cancellations so that I might be placed in that slot and moved up to a sooner service date. After going back and forth, I was informed by Marg/Marge that she could actually make an appointment for me for the next day "Wednesday, August 24th" for she "had the authority to schedule this appointment for me." I said, "Really? Is this accurate? No one else had that ability, but this is great and I will take it." She asked me what time slot did I want and I said, "I'm flexible and can make myself available, morning preferably, but I will take what you have." She asked, "What about 8am-9am? " I said "Ok. Great." She then said "No wait, 8am-11am." And I said, "Not a problem, I will be available."I confirmed with Marg/Marge about 2 or 3 times to make sure I heard this correct and to verify. She confirmed. I thanked her and we ended the call.August 23, 2011 (~6PM): I called in from my place of employment to await the schedule appointment I had with Comcast/Xfinity on Wednesday, August 24th from 8AM - 11AM.August 24, 2011 (10:08AM): I called Comcast and spoke with a rep. named Cathy/Kathy and explained that I was to have an appointment today between 8am - 11am. It was 10am and I wanted to confirm I still had an appointment set. After reviewing my account, Cathy/Kathy then informed me that I never had an appointment schedule. I told her about the conversation that took place the evening before with "Marg/Marge" and she placed me on hold and came back informing me that "It seems that I was told this information to get me off the phone and appease me. For there was no schedule made and it would have been impossible for a schedule to be made so soon due to the lack of manpower. And to top it off, this person Marg did not leave any notes or recorded the conversation. I'm trying to track this down but it seems it was one from the outsourcing office that this call came from. "Question to Comcast/Xfinity: Do you all produce individuals who falsely give out information? Is this what you all train your members to do -- to insult a paying customer by appeasing them? This is the foundation and company culture is it? Amazing. What an interesting practice to instill with those members of your organization. I did not ask this Marg/Marge person to lie to me. She could have kept that lie and I did not have to take off work for 4 hours based on this lie and their lying company culture that Comcast/Xfinity creates.Cathy/Kathy attempted to schedule me a sooner appointment with the cancellation of another, but was not able to. I was still schedule for Saturday, August 27th. (Honestly, just like I said, why would I believe she would. Why would I believe anything a Comcast/Xfinity representative states to me since your organization has no issue with having members who lie to customers. )August 25-26, 2011 (various times): I called repeatedly to see if there was a sooner cancellation and representatives informed me there were none.August 27, 2011: After awaiting 6-7 days, my schedule appointment has finally arrive. I received a call from Comcast confirming appointment and per the message: "We show you have a schedule appointment for today between 12PM-2PM and this is our second attempt to make sure that you are home. We will call again prior to sending a technician out to you. Etc." I awaited the call back from Comcast and at 1PM, I decided to call to find out the status. The first person I talked to (1:03PM), who's from oversea since I have asked him, stated my appointment was canceled. I asked him for what reason and he said that Comcast could not confirm I was home. I said I received a call and was told I would get another call. He then proceeded to tell me that he can schedule an appointment for me since this appointment was canceled. I hung up the phone.August 27, 2011 (1:29PM): After realizing this company's respect level to its customers is absolutely not there, I called Comcast back. I was placed with a rep. named Crystal. With a witness present, I had Crystal on speaker and asked her why was my appointment canceled. She said, "Let me check," and when she came back on the phone, she informed me that it was due to Comcast not being able to confirm I was home. I asked her, what number is Comcast calling for I only received 2 calls and that 2nd call stated a 3rd call will be made prior to sending a technician out. Crystal then proceeded to say "We have been calling **. " My first thought was maybe she read it too fast or maybe I heard her wrong. But that is not my number. So, I asked her (in front of my witness) to repeat the number again.  I said "Crystal, whose number are you all calling because that is not my telephone number. You said ** and my number is **. " Crystal looked again and agreed that it was an error in the system and does not know where that digit could have came from.Crystal proceed on reviewing the call and said it seems as though Comcast system was calling that number, called it 3 times then corrected herself and called my number twice, then canceled me. Per my discussion and the voicemail left by Comcast, you all call 3 times before canceling, and I was only contacted twice. Comcast, and its technology, called a different number 3 times and booted my appointment out of the system. Crystal placed me on hold to return after and stated she spoke to her supervisor and also to dispatch and explained to them that Comcast was calling a totally different number not associated to this account. Dispatch informed them they will review and contact me. It was all agreed that Comcast/Xfinity was the cause of calling a wrong number, which lead to my cancellation. Why could I not get a technician out that same day when I was not at fault for Comcast/Xfinity calling a number that is not even associated with my account. My account has only 1 number on it since the start of their service 3 months ago.Crystal told me someone will be in contact. I asked her when was this, and she could not confirm. I asked her if I should call back in a few hours, but she said someone will contact me. To this day, I'm awaiting a call from dispatch.August 27, 2011 (Later that evening): I call Comcast to find out, I have a service appointment schedule for September 6, 2011. Your company is truly amazing. No call back and due to a Comcast error, I have to await another week for service.August 28, 2011 (Started back on my call to see about a cancellation slot): Comcast supposedly moved me to an appointment, September 3rd (7:30am-8:30am).August 29, 2011 (Started back on my call to see about a cancellation slot): Spoke to  Jim who informs me nothing sooner is available and my appointment is set for September 7th. September 7th? When did this change take place? I was initially after Comcast error on Saturday, August 27th scheduled for September 6th, then moved to September 3rd. Now, I have been moved to September 7th and no one has contacted me, informed me or anything. So, when was I suppose to find this out. Oh wait, I know. When I took off of work again on September 3rd, No one shows up. I call to find out it is September 7th. Amazing.August 29, 2011 (Called "Make It Right" Department at 2:38PM): Spoke to Shirley who went through my records, heard everything stated to her and confirmed with the notes she read, supposedly to took knows on her own (I have no way to verify) and stated she was escalating this to the local office. I informed her:3) Comcast organization culture is based on falsifying information, for that is exactly what Marg/Marge did on last Wednesday and Jim did today when he told me that "Comcast never called the wrong number on Saturday" and Shirley confirmed that  Comcast notes show that ** was called 3 times on Saturday.But you know the kicker -- September 12th. Comcast will want their money from me. Comcast will want payment for no service render. So now, I can add to the list that Comcast/Xfinity likes to steal from it customers. Amazing.
__label__0 The appointment with Comcast to repair my internet access was scheduled from 8-11 am on 7/12/2009. Comcast did not show up, so at 11:00, I called to find out why. And it took quite awhile to get an answer, but they eventually said the tech would be there soon. While I was talking with Comcast, the tech called at 11:07 followed by a call from the dispatcher at 11:11 and these two messages were routed to my voicemail. When I hung up with Comcast at about 11:15 and listened to the dispatchers message, I learned that my appointment was now canceled because I did not answer the tech's call at 11:07.For the next six hours, from 11:00 to 5:00, I repeatedly called Comcast to explain that I didn't answer the 11:07 call because I was talking to them about their missed appointment. I was told many things (the tech will call you back; you're next on the list; the dispatched will call in 15 to 30 minutes; he'll be there in 1/2 hour; a supervisor will call; he'll definitely be there before the end of the day), all of which turned out to be false. I wasted nine hours on a beautiful summer Sunday afternoon waiting on Comcast. And they never did show up.
__label__1 I called on 3 December @ 0845 and talked with Toni. She was very nice/courteous and scheduled our home to get the Comcast HD preferred Plus Triple Play. I conveyed to her my time is limited and she assured me Comcast guaranteed a two hour service window. We scheduled my appointment for this morning (Tuesday, 22 December from 0800-1000 hrs), I took the hours off of work to be at the house. At 0955, the supervisor of the service technician called and said they'll be running late sometime after 1030 hrs. I cancelled the appointment as my first impression (my first Comcast experience) was Comcast not honoring their guarantee two hour service window. I work at a large hospital, where there is a high rotation of personnel. My office is one that helps new people about a variety of services in our local area (water, electric, cable, etc). When asked, I'll be sharing my experience about Comcast.
__label__1 My experience with Comcast has been so stressful that I can hardly sleep. For one my bill is 688 and 80% of that is overcharges! My privacy was violated as they let someone have access to my account with my permission and without my SS number. I have called numerous times to try and get answers to why this happened and spoke to numerous people. One lady laughed at me and was extremely rude. Another man told me the person who tried accessing my account gave them my SS number. Every time I call I get different answers or they have no clue what I'm talking about! This place needs to be shut down or have some sort of investigation. There hidden costs and add on every month. One time they came to my house and took our line off the phone pole to disconnect us for no reason! So we had no service for days and nothing was done about that either! This company makes me sick. There is also more I haven't added but don't have time to write a novel.
__label__1 They sign you up for one thing and they charge you for higher price. You never get the speed they promise. Their customer and internet service sucks!!!!!!!!
__label__1 From the first day it was a headache. The technician came out to install and as soon as he started it was already not what I wanted. He added an extra box, apparently an extra outlet and the channels that I wanted were not included with the original price. Then he continuously ignored me asking him to stop the installation process. I decided to call Comcast so they could at least cancel on their end which even though they agreed to, they never actually did. After the installation was complete the technician refused to uninstall saying that it would take a lot of work and he had other jobs to get to. After enough arguing he agreed to come back when done with the other clients which he never did. I was definitely shocked when my first bill was over $300. When I refused to pay it the service was suspended and I was told that to fix any charges I needed to restore it first. There would be a reconnect fee as well as another $200 added on because it would start a new billing cycle. I figured that it would be fixed anyway so it would be ok. However at some point between my dozens of calls I found out that I was in a contract so not only could I not adjust anything I also could not cancel because of early termination fees. Again I refused to pay and was told that a supervisor would contact me to fix this and waited for a call which never came. The account was again put into suspension and is now disconnected with the added cancellation fees totaling $784 for the last 3 months. To top it off I'm once again waiting on a supervisor to return my calls and I am dropping off the equipment to avoid an additional $470. What a nightmare!!
__label__0 Since having Comcast services for the past 2 1/2 years, my husband and I have only experienced problems. None of our bills or services are consistent from month to month. The last incident occurred in October 2010. Our bill increased by $30. We were informed that this amount would last for six months and Comcast was offering no deals. Our last bill that was received in November increased by $70. I called Comcast on November 26, 2010 and was informed that on the previous call, we had requested additional services. We spoke with four representatives and there were no changes in our services. I asked for representatives' last names, which they would not give and I also asked for a letter to be sent in the mail of proof of our conversation, which they also refused. On this last call, I was told that all additional charges for new services would be removed but they could not guarantee the amount that was discussed in October. The representative also said that I would receive a call from a representative to discuss these charges within 24 hours. I still have not heard from anyone and our bill still has not been changed. I expect our bill to decrease to what we were guaranteed in October and also want it extended more than six months. Why does Comcast expect their customers to call every six months to discuss new plans, when they are not even willing to offer new plans?
__label__1 I have been contacted by someone from their executive support dept. after talking with them, all that was able to be resolved was 50.00 credit and an offer to replace the modem / gateway to an older model and I would have to get my own router. This is basically all that can be done. Comcast does not consider this a real problem worth their time and expense.Original ReviewI just checked and of course, the Wi-Fi has been enabled again, just as I thought Comcast is purposely enabling the WIFI Hotspot after I log out of my account. I know this because I use a app called Wi-Fi Analyzer and it shows a Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspot broadcasting signal. The ID numbers are almost identical to mine (only the 2nd number is different - EX: Mine is E8 / Xfinity WIFI Hotspot is E6) to prove that it is my gateway broadcasting the signal, I unplugged the gateway and yes both signals disappeared and reappeared when I plugged it back in. This is clear proof that Comcast is purposely lying to me and all it's customers - letting them think they can shut down the Free WIFI Hotspot, knowing that it will be automatically turned on when they log out of their accounts. It's bad enough that I pay a high bill for my Internet, plus the fact that Comcast charges me a Gateway Rental Fee and you lie to your customers about this. I guess Comcast doesn't care that they leave their customers open to Hackers and ID thieves. Of course, they will claim it's totally safe, but any decent hacker can get around the firmware & software and hack a router/gateway. Nothing is fool proof.
__label__1 Signed up online for new service, scheduled installation (confirmation email received). Installation day, no one shows up. Call customer service, they can't help because it is a new sale, transfer to sales. Sales can't do anything to account, told to go to local store. Go to local store, they see the account. They also see a cancellation with no reason listed. They can set up a new service, but they can't give same 'deal' as online. Only option is to go online and start over. No thanks, they lost my business.
__label__5 It's my belief that Comcast agents are poorly trained. I just completed calls to them about my service, and was transferred from "expert" to expert, but in the end, my service was not restored, and I currently have no internet provider (Xfinity) because of my upcoming move. No expert at Comcast can reinstate my account, and I just might have to take Comcast to small claims court. The cable service was very good, but now that I use wifi exclusively it does not work at all. I'm currently using a hotspot at our free public library.
__label__1 Hours spent chatting, emailing, writing back and forth. COMCAST acknowledges they owe me back my deposit and keep telling me the check is being processed and will have soon. It's now 5 months later and no check. I keep getting the same run around. So aggravating!
__label__1 I have been trying to get a television problem fixed for at least 3 weeks. They have sent 3 techs out and it isn't any better. I am getting tiling and no sound during that time of tiling on just a few stations, but they are the ones that I watch a lot. One of them is the NFL channel. So, today was the 4th appt set for 3-5 pm and a no-show. I called and the young man set it for 5-7 pm today and was very apologetic. Well, NO-SHOW!! So I call and a young girl was very nice and told me that the appt was cancelled and set for 6 days from now. WHAT!! I didn't know anything about this and who the .... cancelled it today. She couldn't answer so I asked to speak to a supervisor. He told me the same thing that it was cancelled today and set for 6 days from now. Well, they are having internal conversations and leaving the customer, me, out of it. I proceeded to give him the long story of this is the 4th tech for the same problem. Now I'm .......... and he said that he saves a few appts for these types of issues. So I will see someone at 8 - 10 am in 2 days. What bugs me the most is the lack of communication and apparent issues internally. And it's Saturday and cancelled plans this afternoon and dinner tonight for this .... We'll see what happens. Close to leaving and I know they won't give a ....
__label__1 We met a Comcast representative at a trade show and agreed to meet with him in the afternoon the next day. He was a no show but did call at 5:30 to say that he was unable to make the tentative appointment. Two days later I received a message from Comcast confirming an appointment for the next day. I did not make the appointment so extended to them the courtesy of canceling in. I was placed on hold twice. Spoke to two representatives and explained that I had not made the appointment I was cancelling. Both made me verify my credentials two different ways and asked me to explain why I was canceling the appointment. At 8:20 pm the same night I received another call verifying my appointment. I think I know why our bills are so high -- too much service.
__label__0 I have had Comcast service since it first took over AT&T cable. As their product offering increading their service has deterioratad. To the point where pricing goes increases and they limit my ability as a consumer to control my monthly bill.The last time i moved i was forced to utilize one of thier modems even though i had purchased mine through one of thier speciasls in order to avoid 'monthly modem fees. They also gave me a 'introductory' cable/ internet rate and was told i could modify it in the future as needed. Possible even obtain 'a la carte' services.  Today i was told that wasn't possible and could only downgrade to 20 channels for $15 or pay the $60. What? $15 or $60, where is the in between?!!! Then my internet service is not tiered at speeds, this was never the case before. We paid a flat fee for flat service. It's either $24 for 1mb or $45.95 for 6mb. Comcast is forcing consumers to bare bone service or excessive pricing.  Unless you choose to Bundle all three of their services.  They should NOT be allowed to treat consumers like this!Financial implications of unauthorized monthly fees and unclear billing practices. 
__label__1 Enough is enough. Waiting for a digital box to be sent to use and 2 weeks of Comcast rescheduling service calls that they never showed up for, I finally canceled Comcast went to AT&T U-Verse. I had problems with my cable TV and internet was very slow. Every time I called they sent out a signal, it did not work also. Scheduled appointments between no shows, not being able to watch TV, or able to stay on internet. We had enough, I canceled Comcast on 09/09/2015 after 15 years of business. (AT&T found the problem right a way. The squirrels ate into cable.)
__label__0 Ice storm in Massachusetts and Southern NH killed power for over half a million folks for up to 6 days. Naturally, Comcast service was disrupted as well. Understandable. What I do not understand is why Comcast would prevent their customers from viewing programs previously recorded on Comcast DVR equipment!I paid for the service and the rental of the equipment. The digital media is available on the hard drive but without a connection to Comcast, I am prevented from watching it. Is this right (legal, ethical)? I paid Comcast for the programs and the hardware on which it was recorded. I am not reproducing it, I only wish to watch what I paid for. How can Comcast prevent me from viewing this content simply because their service is down? 
__label__0 I wonder why there is no closed captioning on any news and mini movies in any channels. I am very disappointed and won't watch these if there is no closed captionings because I am totally deaf and won't understand the lip speech at all. Please correct or contact Comcast Cable, I guess in PA. or Indiana.
__label__0    Comcast Some Staffs working at Rockville, MD 20850 are very rude! and gave me wrong information.I have never seen such rude customer services in this country. I was mentally tortured by them. Their rudeness intimidated me and the wrong information that two staffs gave me misled me. But I didn't give up and kept looking for chances to get what I paid for. After waiting in the lengthy line again and again,  finally I found a staff who are able to help me. But again, she is extremely rude as well. 
__label__1 Waited for technician to arrive for appt scheduled on 11/13/13, for cable service hook-up between 8-10am 11/14/13. No technician arrived. I could only call various Customer service executives from Manila, Philippines twice, and Panama. These reps said that it was an all day appt. During my efforts to navigate through customer call center was told by automated voice that a tech had recently visited. I waited the rest of the day for tech to arrive but did not call or show. I asked rep from Panama if system still showed that an appt was pending. He stated that he could see in system that my appt was next for tech. They changed my appt status from 8-10am to all day appt. Additionally changed the status that a technician had visited. NOT TRUE!
__label__1 Comcast canceled the TV guide channel 96. What a cheap ass company! Now you have to upgrade to a more expensive TV package just to get the TV guide channel. Plan to dump Comcast.
__label__1 After finding a rental charge on our bill, we looked at history going back at least a year and found that we were being charged for a modem rental fee ($10 per month) for a modem that we never requested or got from them. After requesting that our payment history be looked at by a supervisor (Derik **), I was told that the supervisor would call me back with their findings, (to which I never got a call back from). I am now being told that Comcast will only refund up to 90 days' worth of "FRAUDULENT" charges.Long story short... If they can RIP YOU OFF for more than 90 days, IT IS YOUR FAULT FOR NOT CATCHING THEM SOONER!! "This is their company policy." Should any rep from Comcast choose to respond or contradict this review, feel free to contact me or respond!! I am certain that they will not respond since they capitalize on you not watching your every bill, which is clear by their own policy!
__label__5 Customer support is terrible. Appointments are difficult to schedule. Customer Support personnel will promise you services that the repair person hasn't heard of or be notified of. It usually works pretty well but the internet seems to disconnect/connect at all times. The value is very poor. Bill is way too high. When it works, it works well. But too often the tv freezes up, or the guide has wrong shows listed. Although I complain about Comcast, compared to other cable services I have talked about with friends and co-workers, it seems to be the best offered in my area.
__label__1 We have been a long standing Comcast customer. First it was the double billing. Tried to arranged the cycling time frame where it would fall at a different time frame did not work. Second issue was the phone - it suddenly cut off in midstream of a conservation. It kept happening and they kept trying to fix the issue so we decided to upgrade our land line phones. And last the past two weeks there has been numerous outages in the zip code 38133 so patiently waiting for service to be establish on. Yesterday June 4, 2016 - it took four hours, 4 - 8:5 pm and was notified via phone the service was back on. Got to check and guess what? Partial service, phone and internet but no Network. So as of this morning I do not know whose internet network service I am using! It was stated by two technicians it was the modem it is outdated. Well it was working prior to low but working! We receive a notice a few months ago to upgrade via XFINITY site to receive a new modem. Never could get that to work, tried several times! For an additional charge the Technician could come out and make the switch. I feel it is up to your company to supply new uncharged equipment not the customer. Now I have to make a trip to the satellite location to turn old modem for a new! Since I had a minor procedure on Friday was not up to traveling but now I must! The phone and two IPADs is connected to my Network so only the main computer is operational. This was incompetence at the highest but I must give credit to the agent since he was insistent on selling me a package. Could you imagine if I had bundle everything with you I would have no electronic service this morning! I will no longer be Comcast customer. This is the last straw! 
__label__0 Last January 13th, I established a new business telephone service with Comcast.  My line was installed by your technician due to incompatibility with my Vonage service, especially since the new cable TV transition.  I went to your office to finalize my transition on January 14th.  I told the customer service representative that the technician came to my house, installed the line and gave me a new number.I could make calls without any problems so I contacted my family members to let them know of my new number.  I called my relatives in Cincinnati, Atlanta, Marilyn, California and New York.  I contacted old and current clients, as well as client prospects, via phone and email to assure be sure that they all had the new number because I was in the middle of a project or negotiations with them.  On January 14th through the 18th, I could receive calls, make calls and I was in and out all day.  It didn't occurred to me that I was not receiving any calls until the police showed up at my door around 9pm on the 18th, said that my friend in Cincinnati was worried and wanted them to check to make sure I was doing fine.  Some man was answering my old line and my new number was out of service.  I called my son in New York the same evening he said that he had been trying to call me and became concerned because the old number went to a residential phone in an 831 area code and the new number was saying that you have reached a number that is no longer in service service.  How embarrassing!I immediately contacted my current clients to let them know that I was having phone problems and I was told by one that we will wait until you get your financials in order.  The only thing I could do was to call and apologize to the others.  Their demeanor were all the same.I was so wrapped up in trying to meet my financial obligations that I neglected to phone my cousins, who came by my house Saturday morning last January 22nd to let me know that my uncle had passed that morning.  My cousins said they tried to reach me when he took a turn for the worse on Friday afternoon but was unable to do so.I was on the phone with your customer service for hours Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  Each took the opportunity to call both numbers to confirm my story about the two telephone numbers but no one could help me.  Today is Tuesday the 25th of January, and I still cannot receive calls.  The new number is still saying you have reached a number that is no longer in service. Comcast has managed to destroy my business reputation with one clean swoop.  I am so devastated at this time that I can hardly breath, sleep or eat.  I am a new business owner, struggling in a suffering economy and have barely been able to stay afloat.  I am in no position to compensate for your service malfunction.  I am embarrassed to no end from having the police come to my door, yet grateful that my friend was concerned enough to send them.  I have no savings.  I have maxed out both my bank account and my credit card in an attempt to pay my bills.  I have lost approximately $2,500++ in one week.  I am filing a formal complaint with you because I feel you owe me more than a credit on my account.  If I am able, I will need to clean up this mess you have created for me in order to keep my business going.  Instead of spending more hours on the phone trying to resolve this problem myself, I decided to write this letter, to just be put off again.I know a great deal about your company through my research.  I grant research for non-profit organizations.  I'm sure your founder and Chairman Emeritus at Comcast Corporation would be appalled by the poor representation of such a prestigious organization such as yours.Per advice, I have to make all effort to contact executive officers, to see if this can be resolved internally.  I was told by your customer service and technicians that my service is in a transition period.  12 days and counting is negligence.  I have spent 10 hours of my time attempting to get help.  As of 9:09pm, after talking to a representative for 4 hours, my service is still the same. I Want Compensation for the lost income, loss of clients, hours spent on the phone, sleepless nights, depressing days, anxiety, rage, aggravation; clients withdrawing their business, loss of my business reputation; distressing family and friends, not being able to receive any calls, hospitalization (high blood pressure February 17, 2011), changing information on my business cards and other documents, sending letters of complaint regarding the ongoing neglect and miscommunications from Comcast Executive officers for 6 weeks.
__label__1 I signed up for one year new internet service deal with the Comcast/Xfinity for $39.99 last November so I got the paperless bill for next following two months for $39.99/month. However, Comcast sent me the bill through mail and charged me $44.99. My bill is supposed to be $39.99/month for one year which means until this year November. That's the deal what I saw online and that's the deal what the customer representative signed me up for. I was not sure why they increased the bill by five dollars so I called and talked to one of representative. However, this representative did not what the heck she was talking about and I don't think she even had a clue why the bill increased by five dollars. She kept saying $44.99 is still a promotion value for same internet speed over and over again. But $44.99 is NOT what I signed up for!! I told her to let me talk to supervisor but she told me supervisor was busy. Well, I'm a busy person, too. Does she think I like talking to her for more than an hour? I was supposed to get a call from supervisor within two hours but it has been more than a day, and I still haven't got a call yet. Xfinity internet speed is faster and better than other but they have the WORST customer service.
__label__1 If I could give negative stars I would! Where to start? Hmm. Their customer service is a joke. I literally have had issues needed to be fixed and have waited multiple times for over an hour to get a hold of someone. Multiple times waiting and then their line disconnects after waiting. They tell you one thing and do another then pretend it's not their fault. Pricing is outrageous! At least a few outages a month are guaranteed and they won't even make right on the time you're without service BC of an outage. Trust me, I've tried. Comcast is literally a wolf in sheep clothing! Don't give Comcast that satisfaction by paying them your hard-earn money just for a headache and a good laugh for them.
__label__1 Where to start... I guess it's due to the monopoly that they have no reason to service customers. I moved into a Xfinity-only area and after 2 days, I could not be more dissatisfied. I've experienced no less than 5 errors, 2 related to channel lineup, 2 related to erroneous overbilling. (It's never underbilling is it?!) The most hilarious tale of incompetence was when they added a $10 charge for a rented modem when I added channels and I called to ask them to remove it as I own my own modem - instead of removing the charge, they added a second charge just for kicks. (As if I had 2 rented modems!!) I called back and the agent this time said he can't authorize it and he's submitted a ticket which will take 7-10 days to correct. He also suggested I call back before 7 days because 'this process isn't perfect!' I wish I had any other option than Comcast but they have a monopoly here. About time that changed.
__label__1 Contacted Comcast because all services were out (we have the triple play bundle). After they keep me on my cell phone for 1.5 hours trying everything they know to get it up and running they set me up for a service appointment 2 days away. OK I can live 2 days without cable, internet and phone. The repairman comes between the times designated and shows me the A/C adaptor that they use to power their equipment in the house - the adaptor has failed. He cannot give me a new adaptor. He has to put in a new transformer box. After listening to the service tech tell me how the last installer screwed everything up and now he has to fix everything, for 2 hours, now everything is finally fixed. Wait for it... I get my Comcast bill and much to my surprise (OK I'm not surprised, nothing is that easy) I find that I have been billed $40.00 plus taxes to have a repairman come to my house and fix Comcast's equipment.When I call customer service Angela confirms that I had to pay this bill. Since the worker had to come into my house to fix their equipment the charge is valid. I certainly realize that my 1 account means nothing to Comcast and I will be switching to Verizon as soon as my contract is up. What Comcast doesn't realize is that I also control an account that has 75+ boxes and pays over $4,000 per month in cable charges. I'll be looking to switch that account as well. So yes, in this instance they will end up getting me for $40.00 but I will ensure that they will no longer receive $4,204.00 per month from me or my company. Even with the extra $4,000 per month, I realize that I am a tiny fish in a huge pond. But $50,000 per year is $50,000 per year and even though I'm insignificant to Comcast, I'm sure Verizon or AT&T will welcome the opportunity to take that money.
__label__0 Beware of Comcast, too big for good policies and service.Installation was horrible and took 2 months, 6 visits, overcharged for them to get service going. After 3 years, when disconnecting on 8/9/2010, they still charge for a full month on the final bill and then prefer to send a check for the service you did not use, which takes up to 5+ weeks! Why overcharge for something you did not receive in the first place?! Horrible process.
__label__1 Where to even begin... I called Comcast to set up the basic internet plan. I have my own modem and router, but they managed to send me their wireless modem and charge me. I scheduled an appointment for a tech to come to my house, and they don't show. After another month I get a past due bill from Comcast, remember I still don't have service. The young lady I talked to at Comcast said I could have it waived if their tech comes out.. I said okay, fine. When tech gets here my service is shut off due to nonpayment. Thought this was figured out, but apparently not. Called again and the rep said this is taken care of and turns on my service. One day later my internet shuts off AGAIN because of my past due amount. Let's just say I have about lost it with them but was nice to the young man because he said okay, you're good to go with a 0 balance.... Same day I talk to him the internet is still off, still showing a balance and now they are closed. Convenient... Worst customer service ever. Much wasted time dealing with the same problem that should have been resolved from the first call.
__label__0 There are several cable wires that lead from my house to the pole. I have attempted, many times, to have these wires either removed or raised. During a recent storm, they were pulled from the house and are lying on the ground. There are small children and animals at this residence. I have waited the entire day for a technician to show up for what I was originally told would be a 2pm appointment. I called the company at 1pm and was informed that this they have until 8pm to show up. I have been in the house the entire day because I am needed to unlock the gate.
__label__1 I have poor reception on multiple channels.  A service call charges to fix outside wiring.  They have rude customer service, and I had to call multiple phone numbers to get anyone to fix anything, because no one person is 'authorized' to do anything.
__label__1 I have been a customer of Comcast for many years now. My home service is very erratic and despite several complaints, the issue has not been resolved. The trouble began on or before 12/16/2014 and has not been resolved yet. A Comcast technician visited on 12/22/2014 and saw the Orange cable that connects the Comcast Box near my home with another join from another Comcast Box 2 homes away - the Orange connector wire has been on the Road, in the rain and cold, and is stepped upon by people who walk that way, and is driven over by vehicles. I have been making complaints on the phone again and again, but to no avail. Since 12/16/2014, every time I have called, the automated system informs me that an outage has been reported in my area and that technicians are working hard to fix it, and that it will be fixed by N:NN AM/PM - the time indicated the fix will be complete comes and goes, and when I call back again, the fix time is now shifted upwards, to a deadline a couple of hours from the earlier deadline that passed by. My service has been very very erratic and I am extremely frustrated and mad, as I am stuck with Comcast for lack of a comparable alternative. I upgraded my service to 50Mbps and then to 105Mbps, but every time I am on a conference call and the caller on the other side does a screen share, my Skype connection is dropped immediately due to poor internet connectivity. I am very dissatisfied with Comcast's (non) handling of the issue and am unable to work. Please help me!!!!! I had complained about this last week as well, and an appointment was scheduled for Saturday (01/10/2015) and when the Comcast technician failed to show up, I called, and was told that the appointment was cancelled because there is an ongoing outage in my area. I had put aside all my chores for Saturday waiting for the technician to show up, and not only does the technician not show up, Comcast does not even bother to call me to inform me that the appointment is cancelled. I am at my wits end now, and cannot understand the apathy of a business towards its customer. I have been told that there is an underground cable breakage to the box that supplied internet to my home (to overcome the issue "temporarily", the orange cable has been connected between the two boxes), and that a work order should be in progress to fix the issue - THERE HAS BEEN NOBODY WHO CAME TO FIX THE ISSUE OF THE BROKEN UNDERGROUND CABLE TILL DATE (01/11/2015). Please ensure that this message reaches up the chain and is resolved ASAP.
__label__1 About three weeks ago one of our tvs went out. Comcast was very quick to schedule a service visit which was awesome. However after a two hour visit, heavy furniture moved, cords disconnected, and no problem solved I was a little shocked and disappointed in the service. Right after the service man came and solved nothing, two more tvs went out due to lost connection. (Maybe the multiple cords he pulled apart and left?) So I just got off the phone with customer service for the 2nd time. First time I was told to order a new box at my cost. I did. Problem still exists. This time I was clear. "I want another service visit by a different person bc now 3 tvs have lost signal." After an hour on the phone with this woman my tv is still broke, she wouldn't let me schedule a service visit, and then she ended the call and hung up. Great job Comcast. We'll be canceling in the next few days.
__label__1 There is nothing new here, just another angry customer of Comcast. I had Triple Play service for many years with Comcast. I always paid somewhat high, but manageable price to have TV, internet and phone. In the past year, by bill went up to $160 and calling Comcast multiple times to lower the bill didn't have any effect. Lately, I was thinking about cancelling my phone services as we no longer need it; we have cell phones and never use land line. Comcast told us that it would cost us more to pay for 2 services (TV plus internet) than 3 services (TV, internet, and phone). What? What kind of nonsense is that? When I mentioned about Double Play deals they advertise on their site (TV plus internet) for $80 a month, they said it's only for new customers. Huh? I've been a customer for over 10 years, and youre telling me that you don't care about your current customer and rather find new ones? Wow, what a great business model. Keep it up. You will lose more customers, as I have already switched to AT&T and am returning my Comcast equipment today. By the way, AT&T has a much better TV menu and navigation.
__label__0 Internet is very slow and has been for at least a month --as slow or slower than dial-up. Four service attempts have been made --two at the house and two on the street. The speed is unchanged. Today I could not even reach Comcast as their call center is apparently too busy to handle the calls. Can I get out of my contract with this inferior service? I'm paying for high speed and getting low speed.
__label__0 I received my bill in August on September and noticed that it was $25 more than usual.  Comcast decided to back bill me for a box I do not have!  Their 2 service reps took it when I had a DV-R installed last November.  They apparently never logged it in and told me it's missing. They sent a service representative to my home to search for it and take numbers of all the boxes I do have.  It has been 10 days now and they are still looking.  They told me that if they didn't find it, I would continue to be billed.  This is nuts. I suppose their service guys are boy scouts and I, the customer, am a crook who hoards little black boxes.  They are going to bill me late charges if I don't pay in full by next Tuesday.
__label__1 Got Comcast a few months back. Not only are they unable to provide the internet signal I am paying for - they give me the complete run around every time you call the support. The "agents" consistently switch me from one channel to the other and the result stays the same, the signal goes down 3-10 minutes for every 30 minutes of use. I have been switched between channels approximately 8 times now, I have also been sent to their store for a replacement modem/router and nothing helps. They now tell me that I need a service tech and that I may end up paying for the service tech even though their product never worked to begin with. Of course one of their "agents" told me that I could buy an insurance policy for $5 a month so I would not be charged for the service visit. You have got to be kidding me!!! This is the worst company I have ever done business with - it is a fraud, pure and simple. I am being charged for a product that doesn't work!! Fraud!!
__label__0 I moved from my former address to my current address in July. When I received my bills I paid them. I realized that the Comcast bills were not just being forwarded to the new address they were actually for the old address too. I called today to ask that my $333.59 be returned to me. They wanted to keep it and credit toward my new address. They then said that I would receive a phone call in 3-4 days from someone to discuss it.I said none of this is acceptable and asked to speak to a supervisor. After being on hold for close to 9 minutes, Akidra transferred me to Ebony. Ebony had no authority to make any changes. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she said there were none. This is the last straw for Comcast for me. They sent technicians to my house that were subcontractors that barely spoke English. He tried to charge me extra for phone jacks, made the cable too short so I am unable move the box, left dirty foot prints all over the house, left the covers half screwed on wall, and left hand prints on my silk chairs. I am switching back to Verizon.
__label__5 I subscribed to have cable and internet provided by Comcast on 7-17-2012 for self-installation. On 7-19-2012, a technician came out and said that our box outside wasn't working and we needed to have our products installed. We called before he left our home and we had a scheduled time for 7-24-2012 for installation. The customer rep said they will be calling us to confirm our appointment. No one ever called, so we called and spoke to Glen in customer service to make sure our appointment was still on for the day because I took the day off. He stated I was wrong and we had no appointment. I stated we did and I wanted to talk to a supervisor. He stated 4 times that his supervisor was busy and I could not talk to them. So, he ended up connecting us to the local area Comcast and they dropped the call. We had to call back and this time, we got JR in customer service, who did put us to a supervisor Rose. She connected us to our local area again, this time, we talked to Karen and she stated that she was sorry that everything was confused on our order, it said it was cancelled but completed. I said it was not completed, so she took notes and told us she was giving all our information to the emergency techs and they would be calling us in 30 minutes to 2 hours. 4 hours went by and I called back to Comcast customer service. I got Harry and he was very rude, laughing at me 3 times. I stated I wanted to talk to a supervisor and he asked why. I told him he was not taking me seriously. He told me he was and that I was wrong for wanting to talk to a supervisor. I had to tell him over and over that I wanted a supervisor. He finally put me over to Michelle, who was not his supervisor and that she was just another supervisor, but she would help me. I stated to her that I wanted to talk to Harry's supervisor. She also stated Harry's supervisor was busy. I told her I wanted to talk to her supervisor. She reluctantly gave me to Rex, which I am not sure if he was her supervisor. He connected me to Louis from our area, a technician. He was very rude and told us that we ordered self-installation and that for him to come out to our home would cost us $50, but he would cut it to $25. I told him no, that after the way we were treated, we wanted it to be installed for free. He told me over and over again that he would not, I would have to pay $25. I told him we just wanted to return our cable boxes and not have the company's services. He then connected us over to Ben in customer loyalty. I told Ben that we did not want Comcast products, that your company treats their customers very badly and I can not believe how we have been treated. He stated that he could send out boxes, but we would have to get the products to UPS ourselves. I told him this was unsatisfactory, that it was not our fault, it was the customer service that Comcast has. All we wanted was to have our cable box and internet installed and then the phone went dead. I can not believe how Comcast treats its customers, who want good quality products with good customer service. The company misrepresents itself on great customer service. So here we sit with 2 cable boxes and an internet box, and I am going to have to go through this whole process again because Comcast cannot get anything right. It sickens me knowing how little and how rudely Comcast thinks of its customers.
__label__1 On 4/1/14 Comcast installed Internet and TV service under their 30 day satisfaction guarantee program. I was not happy with the service and canceled it on April 10. I returned all the equipment. Now Comcast has turned my account over to collections so it has ruined my credit saying that I owe them $143 and no one will tell me what that is for.
__label__1 It seems that once again I find my self an extremely unsatisfied customer of Comcast and would like to make you aware of the unprofessional way in which Comcast is conducting business. I recently moved this past November and called Comcast for cable service. I was offered a promotion for 6 months when I got signed up for Comcast cable. At the time, I did not have a computer at home or the need for internet service. I recently bought a laptop, and several weeks ago, I contacted Comcast to request internet service. The Comcast representative told me there was an offer of $24.95 for 6 months, and he/she signed me up. Since that time, three weeks ago, I have been using my laptop with Comcast as my service provider. On Saturday, my internet was suddenly not available, and when I spoke with your representative, Melody, I was informed that since I already had a promotion on my cable service, they were not able to give me the promotion of $24.95 for internet (even though that was the price I was offered and the agreement I was under during the period of service prior to my account being "deleted" as evidenced in my statement from Comcast). Melody proceeded to tell me that since I was "not entitled" to the internet promotion, they just cancelled my account. I am appalled; no phone call, not an inkling of respect for me as a customer to explain what was going on! Just poof, Comcast personnel deleted my account and completely shut down my internet service. Since I was preparing a case for trial that began this week, this was outrageous behavior on Comcast's part to say the least. Since I would rather spend my time with people in a positive way rather than telling anyone I come in contact with these days about Comcast's lack of professionalism, I am really hoping you can provide me with an explanation as well as an agreeable solution to this issue. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
__label__1 I work in New Kensington/Arnold, PA and continue to be held hostage by Comcast. Pretty much for the past 2 months, we have lost internet service intermittently. They are seldom able to help and whenever contacted, it's always something else -- never Comcast. Now today, we have NO PHONE service. Trying to contact Comcast, is like trying to contact an alien. NO ONE responds. Their customer service is anything BUT customer service. They know there's a problem, but do not have CLUE what it is or how to help businesses.For a business that is 24x7 and relies on phone service, this is unacceptable. I've been on hold most of today. Phones still not working (nor is COMCAST). Our office phones in Fox Chapel have also been out of service causing us to lose client calls as well as calls from our caregivers. We constantly have issues -- no one can ever help. Today was a perfect example. Called their so called CUSTOMER SERVICE number -- also didn't work. Called all afternoon and kept getting disconnected. When I did get someone to answer, they transferred and disconnected me again. Called back, waited on hold again, got someone else to tell me they had no idea how to help. That in a nutshell is the problem --- NO ONE WORKS THERE.... Can anyone help customers -- why is comcast able to continue without major fines??? At the very least, customers should be reimbursed for lost revenue and productivity.
__label__0 I ordered cable Internet service from Comcast on May 2nd. I knew I would be one of the first people in my market to get the service because it had not been available previously. I was sent a self installation kit as I requested, but then received a call saying that Self installation was not supported in Detroit, and I'd need an appointment to have an installer come out. So I promptly cancelled my service that day. Then I finally got a call from someone who actually works for Comcast in Detroit. He told me I never should have been sold a modem in the beginning of May, and that they are still going through detroit upgrading the equipment in some neighborhoods. Why doesn't anyone selling the modems know this? Why have they wasted ao much of my time? There's not one person at Comcast that has any clue what anyone else is doing. The national call center, which is where all calls for technical assistance are directed, is completely useless. They don't knoe what's going on in most local areas. Unfortunately for me, like many others, Comcast is the only choice for cable internet in my area.
__label__0 October 2, 2008 - When I arrived home, I noticed that I had no cable TV, phone service, or wireless internet. Being that this was an important night (vice-presidential debate), I called Comcast (1-800-COM-CAST) immediately. I pressed 1 after dialing the number and reached a representative in their cable-TV department. I did not understand his first name, but continued to tell him of my problem. I first asked if there was any information in my record of the cable to my house being buried, since this was an initial problem when I first moved in (after having no Comcast service, a technician in 2007 replaced the cable after he noticed that the cable was exposed, and was cut by apparently the lawn service). He did not have any information on whether or not the cable was, indeed, buried. After a short conversation, he said that he could send a technician out the next day between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm. I told him that was not acceptable and wanted to have a technician out this evening and asked to speak to his supervisor. I was put on hold for a short time, and then he came back on the phone and told me that there was an outage in my area, and that the service technicians were on the problem. I asked again if there was indeed a problem in the area, and he said yes.I waited about 10 minutes and called Comcast back, and this time pressed 2, which was the Internet Service department. I spoke with a Katrina (last name not known). I asked Katrina if there was an outage in my area. She responded no. She noticed in my records that I had just called in earlier, and I told her of my conversation with unknown telling me that there was an outage in my area. Once again I asked to speak to a supervisor. I told her that the outage story was apparently just a blatant lie, because I asked that a technician be sent out that night. Katrina was helpful, in that she tried to send signals to my modem to fix the problem, however, when that failed, she returned to tell me that there was, in fact, a problem outside, and that she was going to see if a technician could come out to fix it that evening. Unfortunately, I was put on hold, and then disconnected.Third call: This time I called Comcast back and, once again, pressed 2  for Internet Service hoping to speak with Katrina. I reached a Marie who I told my story to for the third time. She said that the quickest way to get service out to me would be to transfer me to cable-TV department, which she did. Victor answered the call. After repeating my story for the fourth time, Victor assured me that there was no outage in my area. I asked to speak with his supervisor, apologizing to him that I was just getting frustrated, and wanted to get the problem resolved that night. I was put on hold for a short time, and Victor returned to tell me that there was a general problem in the area until 11:00 PM that night. I asked if I could still speak to the supervisor, and he said he was unavailable. I then asked what his supervisors name was, and he said Ruth.  I have no idea whether this was a first or last name, but Victor said his/her employee ID number was **.  Strangely, I could hear the supervisor Ruth giving Victor his/her ID number in the background.Friday, October 03, 2008 - Since I still had no cable TV, internet, or telephone service at 6:30 AM, I called Comcast back to schedule a service appointment on my way in to work (approximately 8:30 AM). I was told that no service technician was available until Saturday. I initially scheduled my appointment for Saturday between 9:00 AM and noon. The representative asked if I wanted a 30-minute call before the technician arrived, and I declined. When I arrived at work at 9:00 AM, I called Comcast back and told [name unknown] that I would prefer the 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM service call, and that I would indeed like the technician to call before his arrival. The representative told me that if I did not answer the phone when he/she called, they would not show up. I asked what number they would be calling, and he said my home number. I reminded him that since I did not have any service from Comcast, how could I possibly answer my home phone, if it was not working? I then gave him my cell phone number for the 30-minute advance call.Saturday, October 04, 2008 - 8:30 AM, Bill, the Comcast service technician, called me on my cell phone and showed up at my house within five minutes. I showed him the box, which is located in my neighbors backyard, and also the exposed cables located in the common area. The first thing he noticed was that my temporary cable installed a year ago (September 2007) by Comcast was never replaced, nor was it buried. He also said that my neighbor, who has Comcast internet only, was sharing my line. When he was done with his repairs, I was told by the technician that the Comcast repairman that repaired my neighbors internet connection, cut my line intentionally, so that my neighbor could not receive free cable-TV or phone service, thus cutting off my service entirely.First of all, the deceitful responses that I have experienced from the Comcast representatives after my initial service calls are revolting. In addition, to not be able to speak with a supervisor, who was never available (even though one was apparently standing next to the representative, giving him his/her employee ID number) is very poor judgment on Comcasts behalf and bad PR. I have all intentions to report this to every governmental agency to expose Comcasts conniving methods to deceive their customers.I would also recommend that Comcast hire more intelligent people in their call center. It is obvious, that the most common response that their employees are taught is, "I am sorry but that is not possible." They obviously have no idea what they are talking about. However, this is not their fault, this is the fault of their supervisors, who should be reprimanded. I can only assume that because Comcast has a monopoly in this area, that they feel they can do whatever they please. Common Virginians stand up against this monstrosity. If you have (or have had) an issue such as mine with Comcast, please voice your opinion.
__label__1 WARNING: Under no circumstances should you consider Xfinity Home Security. We recently installed Xfinity Home Security in our home in San Francisco. The Comcast representative knew we would be moving soon to Pittsburgh PA and assured us that we could transfer our service. Nothing could be further from the truth. We had to battle for weeks to get the service transferred and we had a horrible battle over an early termination fee. Comcast incorrectly billed us twice for installation and we spent days and days on the phone with call center people who could not correct the problem. In the meantime, we needed to disconnect the system for 4 to 6 months while we renovated our home. Comcast refused to discontinue the billing while we had the system shut down. Keep in mind we are paying our Comcast bill at our other address in Pittsburgh.After a two-month battle with Comcast, we gave up and returned our Comcast equipment. Comcast told us we needed to return the additional motion detectors we had paid for. We received no refund for the equipment that we had purchased. Several weeks later, we get a call from Comcast Customer Solutions now saying they would consider allowing us a six-month billing delay while we renovated. We asked them how could we ever get our bill corrected? They didn't know. We asked them if we would now be charged for a third installation fee? They did not know. We asked them if we were going to have to buy the additional motion detectors again? They did not know. We respectfully asked them to forgive the early termination fee and they said THEY WOULD PURSUE US FOR THE EARLY TERMINATION FEE.Keep in mind, I am paying a monthly fee for Comcast services at my current address. I asked ** if the several hundred dollar early termination fee was worth losing a customer who will be paying Comcast for another 20 or 30 years and he said the early termination fee was more important. We have been a Comcast customer for over 25 years and we are winding down ALL of our services with Comcast. On a scale of 0 to 10, there is not a number low enough to rate Comcast.
__label__0 I'm tired of comcast Reps trying to get me to pay a month in advance it does not make sense and if any other companies are doing this it should be stopped!  It is a form of harrassment the economy is bad right now. If you are late getting the bill they disconnect your service with out warning.when comcast disconnect your service it mess up the coloration of the picture and a off set of the picture tube which damages your TV.
__label__0 It looks like Comcast has decided to use the switch to digital to its advantage. This wasn't evident to me at first but on October 26, 2010, I discovered that my current level of service was no longer being offered. I had to either accept fewer channels or increase my bill by $40 per month and gain quite a few channels. Our household has had limited basic cable for 15 years. The price has increased from around $12 per month to $19.95 in that time period. We even moved once with no noticeable change to our plan. Now Comcast is telling me that I'm getting channels I shouldn't, and that I must accept fewer channels for the same amount or pay $60 per month (but they do have a 6-month special). This is because with the switch to digital, the limited basic package was reduced and for the last year or so I've been getting channels I shouldn't.From what I can gather, Comcast does not want limited basic cable customers. This reduction in service is an attempt to purge this level of service. I've been told that you can't call up and receive limited basic cable - only those who've had it are allowed to keep it. Once you're out you can't get it any more. It seems convenient for Comcast to blame this on the switch to digital.By the way, I'm not even sure Comcast has their story straight. The first rep I talked with said I could go pick up the technology I need from a Customer Service center (no mention of fees or charges). The second one I spoke with said that I must choose a $60 plan if I wanted more than channels 2-28 with my cable. 
__label__1 I had poor customer service problem resolution experiences with Comcast in the past. I went to Verizon Fios and aside from the small, hard to read letters that tells you what you are watching when you first turn the channel, their internet and clarity of the TV picture was excellent, never had any pixels freezing like I have seen with Comcast on the old platform, and now with the new Xfinity I am seeing pixelation freezing again! Not to mention the annoying flash for a second or two to tell you the logo of the channel you are turning to and then the program comes on your screen - very frustrating to watch. Pixelation and freezing extremely frustrating. Mind you, we just were "sold" on Comcast to come back because their silver tongue salesperson at Best Buy in Mt. Laurel told me the issues I had above were fixed and the new XFinity platform fixed it blah blah blah. In addition, my phone # NEVER got "ported" over from Verizon to them and I still do not have the ability for anyone who has known my home phone # for the last 30 years to be able to use my home number. We have cell phones, but guess what, we have kids in the house and we for safety purposes want to have a home phone # for now. I have called 11 times to Comcast and spent on average 30 minutes plus per call just to be bounced around and told that they will fix it and in two instances a manager or the person speaking to me "will personally call me back by x date." NO ONE HAS EVER CALLED ME BACK. Comcast is BY FAR the worst company that I have ever dealt with. I am going back to Verizon. By the way the only reason I switched is because both companies will suck you in with a lower (but still expensive) price and then jack your rates up and tell you sorry. When you ask to get a lower, more affordable rate, they force you to switch back and forth and then try to charge you a early termination fee which should be illegal!!! Do not go to Comcast if you have a choice to go to Verizon or any other company!!!
__label__0 Comcast has recently been announcing that some of their channels would be changing to all digital formats. These channels would be unavailable if you do not have a digital converter. A decision was made to upgrade to digital preferred service. The appointment was made. Automated confirmation was received on the day before the appointment and on the day of the appointment.No one showed up within the time allotted although, someone called when time period ended and stated that the technician was running late. Five (5) hours later, there was no tech, no call and no notification of any kind. We found out later that night that Comcast had changed the appointment to three days later. When contacted, they stated that they would were trying to find out what happened to the tech and would send one right out. Yeah right. Eleven (9) hours later, still no tech. We have experienced some of the worst service imaginable in the DC area from Comcast yet, they monopolize the region. Do not choose Comcast if you can avoid it. 
__label__1 Few people realize that Comcast initially lobbied congress to get cable initiated with the promise that the fees paid by customers would make advertising obsolete. Not only did Comcast get that lobbied and modified, but managed to lobby congress to allow advertising volumes to be substantially increased! Now you literally can't hear the show just before an ad and the ad blows your ears off! Shame on congress for screwing us like that! Shame on Comcast for making us pay to watch hours of ads and very little TV shows, and have to pay outrageous dollars for the privilege! 
__label__1 You sign up for something that they say will cost 99 a month with 0 initial costs (for 2 years). You get a emailed receipt for such as soon as you buy (I signed up for a $99 a month service) and a $99 charge to my credit card. You think... "This is good. They didn't scam me." Then 2 weeks later you start getting the shaft! They charge my credit card some type of setup fee for $15 + $10 more a month ("Oh you wanted High def.. that's an extra 10 a month" (fine print I guess)). "Then in June we are charging some extra fees (dude on the phone said it was a new tax out of their control. BS)." My monthly bill is now $120 a month. By the way does not include taxes. The cable/TV and Internet that I actually get are great, but I wish I were not scammed on the $ part. I should of known, you can't trust anyone.
__label__1 We had Comcast for 12 years. The service sucked but it was all we could get where we lived. We would lose either Internet and phone or cable once a week. We would call and they would reset our cable box or modem and it would work for a couple days and then back to normal. We bought a house in a neighboring town. We were able to get FiOS. We called Comcast and gave them the shut off date and our new address so they could send us the final bill. I spent an hour on the phone while they tried to get me to stay with them and not switch. We moved and two weeks later, we received our final bill. Two weeks after that, we received a letter from a collection agency because the final bill wasn't paid yet. The due date on the bill wasn't even up yet. Any chance of us ever switching back to Comcast for any reason is gone after that. They are the worst company I have ever had to deal with
__label__1 I have had cable service with comcast for several years and always had trouble with my service.  The cable goes in and out all the time and I am seldom able to watch anything.  Over the years, they have tried several things to fix the problem such as new wiring and new cable box.  They have given me a discount a couple of times.  But over the last few months, I think they have decided not to do anything else.  They hang up on me, they are rude, they say they will call me back and don't, they don't keep appointments and don't call.  I am really so frustrated.  I don't know wht else to do.  Thanks for your help
__label__5 We discovered last year that Comcast has been overcharging us (likely for several years) 8 devices when we had 4. When we brought this up, would not return my of the overcharge but offered us a free upgrade to X1 and a reduction in our future bill. We demanded that they send a tech out who validated the 4. Our most recent bill has us for 6 devices. We have been attempting to get this resolved but they keep losing connection over the phone, as their system is so cumbersome. I believe it's intent. It's designed to frustrate. Now we cannot seem to keep anyone online for more than a minute and we have to start over explaining the problem each time. Over the past 3 months we are talking about 25+ phone calls attempting to get a correct bill.
__label__1 Called Comcast in PA complaint center. Rep took notes, said that a rep in Jacksonville will call you. A Jennifer called, told me that no matter what I say, the balance is due. I told her that my bill is different every month and I just signed up for 39.99 for cable and 19.99 for internet. And Comcast has never sent me a bill for the same amount. We got into a heated discussion. Told her I should turn my service off. Then hung up. That was at 12:30pm. By the time I got home at 1:15pm, my service was off from the box as well as the pole that I paid for in advance.The tech had already been to my house, cut off service from the pole. Called them back. They told me that it would be a week before service is turn back on. If their rep can't understand that people get upset about things or bills she is in the wrong field, customer service. And will not get credit for the week. It will take for them to turn back on. Bottom line, I need to find an entertainment service that keep their word on how much your bill is going to be. Times are hard and every penny counts. You can't budget a bill that keeps changing every month. That's what the whole complaint was about. Comcast rep told me that she wasn't changing anything any ways. That's when I really got upset. I don't recommend anybody to have Comcast. They are the worst. Jacksonville needs to kick them out like they did AT&T.
__label__0 I had Comcast cable/phone/internet installed on July 13, 2009 and I am ready to cancel them. Every afternoon the service goes out and my phone is dead. What is going on? I am out of work. However, I do typing and depend on a working internet provider. Comcast just tells me it will be up shortly (after I use my cell phone minutes). I need a dependable service. Comcast sure wants their dependable $182 monthly charge!
__label__1 I negotiated a better service plan with Comcast on May 7, 2015. The rep on the phone explained that I would be entering an "agreement" with Comcast, and that early termination of my plan would result in a fee. At the time it didn't sound unreasonable so I verbally agreed. After May 7, 2015, I never received a contract in the mail or via email from Comcast. Nothing was signed or recorded. On approx. November 17, 2015, Comcast dropped the YES network from the channel lineup. Part of the reason why I have Comcast is because of the YES network. On December 1, 2015, I received an email from Comcast outlining my Comcast Term Agreement. The agreement is in fact marked with an installation date of May 7, 2015. It also states I have 30 days from May 7th to cancel the agreement without penalty and that Comcast can change the channel lineups whenever they want. But now its December 1st.My issues are: 1) I was never given a service agreement within 30 days of initiating new service. 2) The rep did not verbally explain that Comcast could alter the terms of the agreement at any time (by changing channel lineups). 3) I was not aware that there was a possibility of the YES network being dropped from the lineup. (I get it, these things happen behind closed doors. But come on.) I'm feeling double-crossed and now stuck in an agreement I would not have entered if I knew the channel lineups would change. It also seems like no coincidence that I received this email today, just two weeks after their change of channel lineups... I bet there's a lot of other folks in the same boat as me.
__label__1 I have been using Comcast as my internet provider since April this year. For the last 2 months, I have been getting a slow signal and/or for the third time no internet access at all. I brought this issue with Comcast, but no satisfactory answer. Curiously, this is happening since the day that one for the sales rep. called me to offer "Blast" which I declined the offer. I wonder, but one thing's for sure. I am canceling the service and go elsewhere for service.
__label__0 
__label__0 For extended periods of time  over  several years, I have experienced  excessive modem disconnections, excessively slow speeds, pixelated  video on my television service, and gross incompetence and lack of concern on the part of the Comcast  service department to resolve the issues. Rest assured that one area of the company's infrastructure seems to work very well; it's billing!The representative simply regurgitates the scripted mantra,  stay home and  an installer will be out to look at the problem. For at least 4 years I have been enduring this lackadaisical, non-theoretical  approach to problem resolution, to no avail. If one wonders why I haven't switched to another broadband provider, the answer is quite simple; My profession as a Systems Engineer requires me to have broadband connectivity and Comcast is the only broadband service provider in the Chicago area. My business suffers along with my ability to perform my work functions. I literally have to go to the local library to work. I have a web presence and and email alias which is non-reachable and not reliably publishable. I have lost customer confidence and  customers as a result of not being able to establish viable communications links with tier one customers.
__label__1 I cannot believe that Comcast is forcing us to purchase HD Converter Boxes for $9.99 per month per box in order to continue receiving HD quality TV on our brand new TVs. I do not have the room to place a big box on my kitchen counter, nor do I want to pay an additional $20 per month in order that I may even watch TV on my two new TVs! This is outrageous!
__label__1 Comcast elected to stop internet service. When I called, I was told that Comcast had decided that the Comcast modem, supplied by Comcast, was at its "end of life". Comcast elected to deactivate it. Comcast elected to do this without any notification to the unfortunate person who made the mistake of being their customer. Comcast has decided it would be most convenient to Comcast for the customer to disconnect the Comcast modem, drive across town to the Comcast office, and try to trade the modem. Comcast will probably decide that it would please Comcast to charge to replace the modem. If so, lawyers will be called.This is an incredibly arrogant self-serving bit of business stupidity - one that stands out even against the slovenly performance Comcast is known for. We will select another internet access provider. Consumers would be wise to not subject themselves to the level of incompetence and arrogance that personifies Comcast.
__label__1 Negligence/Mishandling of Personal Data in Identity Theft Claim - In December of 2011, it was brought to my attention that a Comcast cable account was opened in Houston, Texas under my previous name and Social Security number. It is a fraudulent account; therefore, I immediately began processing the necessary paperwork required by Comcast, each credit bureau and the collections agency holding the now delinquent account. The collections agency provided me with a number for Comcast's Fraud Department (866-225-2677), which is a recording that instructs you on how to process a fraud claim. On March 7, 2012, I sent a police report, FTC reference number, a copy of my driver's license and two utility bills for proof of identity to fax number **. Additionally, I've left multiple messages with no returned calls. After expressing my concerns via Comcast's customer service line, I was told to endure yet another fraudulent claims process. I verbally provided the necessary information and was told that I would receive a call back no later than Tuesday, March 27, 2012. Apparently, a fraud packet was to be sent out as well. Once again, I did not receive a call. Upon follow-up today, March 28th, I've learned the fraud phone number provided to me by the collections agency is an old Comcast number. Since no one can determine whether the number is forwarded to a new number or simply an unmanned number, I have no idea where my voicemails were left nor do I know the locale of the faxed documents I sent. To add more insult to injury, Comcast sent their fraud packet to the address where the fraudulent account was opened.I am now back at square one and have to resubmit a new set of documentation. In the meantime, I receive weekly calls from the collections agency and will until Comcast contacts them with an update on the account. In essence, I am of the opinion that Comcast has been negligent in many regards and has exhibited a total disregard of timeliness and due diligence in this matter. I expect better handling of my personal data given the sensitivity of this matter, the documents I've sent to who knows where and now the documents that Comcast has sent to would-be suspects. Thank you for your time.
__label__5 Great Company to work for but in certain areas they have the wrong people running the show. I believe it should be a complaint line for customers and techs. This is a major problem for techs. Just had a guy to get fired over a job that was done to Comcast specs (code) with notated information on the work order that was over looked by management. One and a half months later the customer received a bill due to the work that was completed. Now a complaint from the customer because they did not expect the bill to be that expensive. They now blame the tech for the work done when the customer acknowledge and had a full understanding of what was going to take place and it was agreed upon. The tech had to pay out of pocket to the customer 300.00. After the customer cashed the check, she still was not satisfied and called in and had the tech fired. The tech had all records and valid information on the work order just as requested by management. Wrong doing.
__label__0 I entered into a contract for Triple Play with Comcast. After 6 months of service, Comcast extended the rates for this service for an additional 6 months. Comcast's invoices went up 50% immediately after the offered extension. I continued making payments based on the extended offer. Comcast cut off my service, reported this on my credit rankings, and sold an unpaid balance to a 3rd party collection agency. However, based on the extension of the promotional rate, payments made on my account exceeded the amount that would have been due (if the invoices had reflected the extension) by $89.49.Additionally, I am due a refund for the return of the converter box and remote. Credit rating has been affected due to nonpayment of account. Third party collection agency has been trying to collect. I have a frustration with Comcast having addressed this issue twice in person at the local office and now twice with customer service. Three out of these four contacts resulted in Comcast telling me that a refund would be forthcoming; one even providing me a ticket number for the refund. However, during a subsequent call to Comcast, I was informed that Comcast had no record of my conversation or the supposed refund ticket.
__label__1 In the last couple of months I have more and more trouble with Comcast or is it Xfinity to keep my Internet connection. My Internet connection is disconnected at least 10 times per day and it getting worse. When I call Comcast or is it Xfinity? It's just always the same. We can do some troubleshooting... That's it. I paid already for a technician even I had this insurance but they told me I did something wrong so the insurance wasn't valid and I paid approximately $75 extra.The Internet page of Comcast... After 1 click it become Xfinity... Is extremely user unfriendly and extremely slow. Sometimes when I clicked on a button I don't know what happens until I see everything (the software/Internet page) is working and waiting... The Internet page of Comcast is just a bunch of... I don't know, because I have to click a dozen time and I need a lot of look to find something useful. Next time I try the same way I am always lost and always on other pages. For me it looks like Comcast WANT that the customer get lost. The Internet presence is just trash, sorry but it is.Calling Comcast (or is it Xfinity) is extremely annoying because first a machine ask you a lot questions and you have to enter a lot of numbers. One minute later you will talk with another machine but this machine ask you the same questions again and you have to enter the same number again. Today I was talking 5 (five) minutes until I came to the waiting loop and I waited 5 more minutes. If I could I would change immediately the Internet provider but Comcast has a monopoly in my area.
__label__1 I was looking to add HD service to my account. Comcast's website shows the products in my area (they ask for your zip to give you quotes). The site says it's $6.50 a month plus a $15 setup fee. When you try to order the service online, you're forced to chat with one of their so-called 'customer service agents' who tells you the service costs $8 a month and the setup fee is $20. If you point out that they advertise otherwise, they tell you 'prices are subject to change'. What the **? This is fraudulent, plain and clear bait and switch advertising.
__label__0    My mom had basic cable for years because that's all she could afford. About a year ago, I started paying for her cable and upgraded her to a better package so she could watch things like cnn and the weather channel.For the past year, we've had nothing but problems with comcast.  To begin with, in order to upgrade her services, Comcast said that it had to come out to the house and install new cable boxes.  They gave my mom a specific time and day, and my mom had to take a half day off of work for that.They were supposed to be there between noon and 5 p.m.  What happened was that they came at 11 a.m., worked only on the outside box, never left her a note or called her to tell her that they were on their way or there or what they had done.  She called 3 different times to Comcast to ask why they hadn't arrived (after 5 p.m.).  Only with the 3rd person did she find out what happened.  The other two said that there was no listing of anyone showing up.  They then tried to walk her through the tv setup process with the remote control, which my senior citizen mom had trouble with (they should have done this before they left). Finally, it all got to working, but my mom was a mess by the time it was done.  Not only that, but it turned out that she didn't really need to be there and didn't have to take time off of work.  So right there they cost her a half-day's pay. Then, over the past 8 months my mom has had periodic issues with the cable just going out.  Twice there have been cable guys to come and look, and while initially they say that her tv is broken, before they leave they figure out that it's their cable box on top of the tv.The first time it happened they replaced her cable box with an older, refurbished version.  That one broke within 4 months.  They then came back out, tried to tell her it was the tv again, til they figured out it was the cable box, and then replaced the refurbished model with a new one.  That worked fine til a month ago.  Now the tv is having the same problem and she has called several times to customer support to get help.  Half of the time she gets people who don't speak english clearly and she ends up not getting any help at all.  When she does talk to someone who speaks english well, they try to tell her that it sounds like her tv is broken (yet again).They've told her more than a few times over the phone that she needs a new tv, rather than send another cable guy out there to diagnose the real problem.  My mom and I are done.  I refuse to pay the $58/month for this kind of service and product, and my mom is tired of not being able to watch tv.  We just ordered Directv for her and it's going to be installed on Saturday.  It will be a great satisfaction to cancel the comcast account.   We just ordered Directv for her and it's going to be installed on Saturday.  It will be a great satisfaction to cancel the comcast account.  
__label__1 From the first day, our experience with Comcast has been terrible. The first installer was hours late. He did a sloppy installation, leaving a giant coil of cable and not installing connectors correctly. The second technician said the first was a contractor and "that happens" - as if that should excuse it. Since then there have been non-stop problems with the set top boxes and the network/phone interface. Other Comcast Voice customers often can't hear our voice when we call. One of our four setup boxes malfunction or lock up on the average - approximately once per week. Solution from customer service rep every time we call in after waiting 10 to 20 minutes on hold - unplug, reboot, and wait 5 minutes for the defective box to restart. We have had the service for 9 months. It was bad as ever. I recently turned off the WiFi portion of the cable modem and installed an external unit that I bought because the Comcast WiFi kept going up and down all the time. I am looking at ways of trimming back on Comcast triple-play bundle services and substituting other vendors until our 2 year contract is up. Never again!! 
__label__0 The first incident was when we ordered our new digital cable box.  We agreed on a time frame of 3 - 4 hours. I spent all day waiting for the arrival and they never showed up.  Called and was told they would come the next day. They did arrive first thing the next day.   Today was my second bad experience of waiting for comcast to come for a service call. New HD TV and need the proper hook up.  Again, waited all day, planning my week around kids, errands and other appointments only to have them not show up again and NOT call.  When I called I got a recording that they would be there the next day between 8 - 11 am.  This is unexeptable!  I rearranged my day around the first appointment.  I wouldn't be so aggrevated if this only happened once.   With the economy so bad right now and Comcast has such a corner on the market - why can't they hire more technicians to be able to handle all the service calls.  We pay a very high monthly rate for our cable and internet service to be treated this way. I'm a stay at home mom so I can't really put an economic figure on my time.  So far it is a total of about 12 hours that I've wasted waiting for Comcast to arrive at my home.  Not to mention having other people pick up my children while I waited.  What is my time worth??
__label__1 Comcast/Xfinity is by far the worst Cable & Internet provider ever. I completely agree with the reviews, because they are indeed accurate and this I know because I'm a customer who regrets signing up for service. I work from home and I'm constantly calling Comcast to report Internet problems such as: slow connections although I'm paying for the fastest and highest one that have. My modem freezes constantly and takes forever to reboot. My horrible internet is always disconnecting and saying that I have no Internet Service available and it's a complete waste to call Customer Service, because all that do is lie and give you the runaround. This is the second largest bill in my home which is ridiculous. I'm paying close to $300 a month for ** service that barely works...The info on "My Account" is inaccurate. I was told that I had 12 days to pay my bill before service would be interrupted, so I was surprised when I tried to access the Internet to start my work shift only to find out that I needed to contact Comcast, because my service was temporarily disconnected. This has happened twice and on today, I turned on my TV to see a message from Comcast that I needed to pay $29.30 to restore my service. Are you kidding me, when I just paid $280.00 on Friday, April 15th...? Is Comcast that hard up for money? I would say "Absolutely" which is absurd. Make sure you always check the 'Bill Details' because it's there when you'll find extra hidden fees.Why is there 9 different "Taxes, Surcharges & Fees" and there are 5 different "Other Charges & Credits" on top of a list of other things...? Comcast will double charge you and once you bring it to their attention, their answer is always "You'll see a Credit on YOUR NEXT BILL." I'm thinking, why the next bill, when the mistake/error was on this one? If they do give you a 'CREDIT' trust and believe, they have recompensated for this by overcharging you in another area. Don't believe me? Check your bill!!!I think we all need to come together and start a 'Class Action Lawsuit' against Comcast/Xfinity. I'm definitely about to talk to a Lawyer, because I'm so fed up with them. You could be calling about a problem you're having and the first and only thing they're thinking about is: "Would you like to make a payment?" If there was another Service Provider in my area, I could guarantee that Comcast would have no business and this is why they feel like they can and is taking advantage of their customers. There are thousands of people who I talk to who call in to vent about their unhappiness with Comcast. What a hike and disgrace!!!
__label__1 And so it begins... I just moved down here from New York and had to choose a provider. I wanted to go with DIRECTV but of course my building is facing the wrong direction. So between AT&T and Comcast. I read reviews on Comcast service and AT&T internet problems. Choosing between the two is like choosing between a Trump and Hillary election, you are going to be disappointed either way. I choose Comcast. After several visits to the place to get equipment and the runaround to get it set up, my internet struggled to get going. They stated the wires are dead in both outlets and would need to send a tech to look at it (which would cost money). Now how would an apartment complex that is continuously full all of a sudden have outlets that are "dead"? I said no and that we would need to go ahead with it and they need to fix it on their end cause I'm not paying for a tech. (This was after I had to go there three times and wait over an hour each time.) Finally some "magical way" they got the internet to be fixed. Now the issues kept coming. On the third month I went to pay and saw that I was billed on the 10th of the month and then again the 27th of the month. How can I be billed for 4 months when I've only had it for 3 and on top of that I was charged a late fee. After several calls... Person 1 says it was a mistake, Person 2 says they do that now, and Person 3 says they're not cause they are only seeing 1 payment due but will remove the late fee. Oh how nice. Person 4 (the manager) says I'm only accountable for the 1 month but I now can see my upcoming bill, then how come I was charged a late fee? They don't know. Shocker!Now my cable issues are fun. Demand is terrible, breaks up all the time and freezes, as if I have a satellite from 1980 hanging off my porch. I had to restart my box several times. And then when I want to rent a movie they change my PIN every time. For the first 2 months no PIN then in the third month I needed a PIN. Called them, waited for 20 minutes to speak to someone. I asked them to remove the PIN. He said he can't so I make a PIN: **. 1 month later the PIN doesn't work. I call them, wait 20 minutes, again tell the guy the PIN doesn't work. He asks me if I would like the PIN removed? Say what now? This company is the most poorly run company I have ever witnessed. I count the days until I buy my house and can finally get DIRECTV. Stay Away!!!
__label__0 I have had many problems with my Comcast internet service. Last Monday, I called and complained once again on how my internet wasn't working. I was to be home the next day so someone from the service center could come by from 2:00pm - 5:00pm. I sat home 3 days before Christmas for this person to come. At 4:30pm I called Comcast again, and they told me that I had to call back at 5:00pm to complain. So at 5:00pm I called back not too happy that I sat home for 3 hours waiting for someone that never came. An escalated ticket was sent out and now I had to be at home from 5:00pm - 7:00pm. Again, no one showed up. Today is Thursday, December 24, and I still do not have a working internet. I complained to supervisors and they were very unprofessional and obviously not doing their job. I am so unhappy with this service and have told all my friends not to use Comcast. I am at a friends house right now using their computer to send this e-mail. Your customer service is horrible.
__label__1 I moved into a new apartment and was transferring my service from the old place to the new place. I scheduled it for a Sunday because I was having surgery the very next day (reconstruction due to breast cancer) and would be recuperating in bed. I waiting in my new empty apartment for the tech to arrive between 10am and noon. My husband called me and said, "Let the cable guy in. He has been pounding in the door for 10 minutes." I proceeded to walk around my entire building... No cable guy here. My husband then asks for the address he is at and he is down the street at the wrong address.Ok...mistakes happen no biggy... The tech shows up... walks into my living room and informs me he can't install my cable because dispatch cancelled the appointment because it was the wrong address. The tech gives me his id #; and makes ME call to reschedule. He informs me that he is now obviously free so they can send him right back out. 8 hours sitting in an empty apartment and 2 additional calls to customer service... Nothing!!So I had my surgery and came home to recover in bed staring at the wall because they just DON'T CARE... I would like to start a class action lawsuit against Comcast for mental distress... These are no mistakes... They abuse you on purpose... They must be stopped.
__label__1 Comcast was installed in my home on March 28. Comcast sent an email to me from a verification department on April 1 to verify information with a number and extension. Needless to say I've been calling them since then and yet to receive a callback today April 16. When I got home needless to say no cable, no internet, no phone and still no response or answer from the verification time and no one else in the entire place can seem to assist me. So as of right now no cable, no phone and a very dissatisfied Comcast Customer.
__label__0 Ive been trying for the past hour to get through to internet security (the ones who can pull the plug on you if they think you are abusing your bandwidth) Anyway, I got through to this TOM guy, I had a few questions for him.  I did not want to give him my phone number, se HE HUNG UP ON ME! I refuse to go through the endless rounds of pressing numbers again to get through, so I called corporate headquarters. (It took my local office 5 minutes to locate and give me this number) Call them and complain (I did so anonymously, of course)  the receptionist seemed nice (her attitude may change if she starts getting a deluge of complaints) Call your local CORPORATE OFFICE to complain.   My wasted time on hold
__label__5 I have had Comcast for over 5 years now, it would seem ever since I have retired. My wife and I moved from upper New york state and we received terrible internet service where we lived! Always shotty, you would have to cross your fingers and say a little prayer to Mary in hopes that it might work! When we moved down here the folks in our retirement community told us about bundling our package for phone, television, and internet so we did. Now I have no use for the darn phone because I have had my cell phone now for some time and it served me well, but for some reason Verizon just doesn't do too well where I'm at! I don't have any coverage! That's why we got the phone.... Well if I tell you that the service I was provided was anything less than amazing I would be just lying through my teeth!Now sure over the years we've had a couple problems especially after hurricane Charlie and a couple nasty storms causing outages and downed power lines, but it was all fixed shortly there after! One time I called up the customer service just as angry as a gang of honey bees, ready to just quit them, because we were out of all three services for 1 week! They immediately apologized and explained that there were some downed lines which there happened to be, I went and looked myself, and they gave me a 25% discount on my bill for that month! I didn't ask for it, they just offered it to me and it wasn't just a day after my call that, it was back on!I see all these angry responses to Comcast and I might not know everything in my 62 years of life! I've been in war, served in the U.S.M.C., rank of Staff Sergeant was the highest I made it to til my service was over! I will say this that for my area, they do well by me. Maybe the difference is the places we are at but they are stellar in my eye!
__label__0 On the 12th of August Comcast came to my home to repair damage done during a storm. On our next bill, they charged me $28.99 for a trouble call. We called customer service and informed them we had the service protect plan. They agreed and told us they would give us credit on the next bill. We were expected to pay the entire bill with the charge for the service call. I told their customer service rep this was not right. I should have my bill adjusted immediately and not wait until the next billing cycle. I am sure we are not the only customer that received an adjustment in this manner. I should not be penalized because of Comcast's accounting system. 
__label__1 I moved into a neighborhood in May that Comcast does not service. I canceled my service with Comcast 6 days later on 5 June and returned my equipment to the return center on 19 June. I continued to receive bills after that and called almost weekly to get the account closed for good. Every time I called customer service, I was told that the account error would be remedied and the amount I owed (nothing) would be corrected in their system. The error was never corrected, and my account was even turned over to a collection agency. After spending hours on hold, speaking with Comcast customer service employees, and multiple confirmations that the trouble would be taken care of, my account remains with the collection agency. Comcast, due to ignorance or greed, refuses to correct their error and credit my account for the erroneous charges.
__label__1 After deciding to give Comcast a second chance, believing that they now had better customer service, I now know I was WRONG. First, even ordering service was a headache. I placed my order online, which went ok. Then I received a 'Welcome to Comcast' email. Less than an hour later I received another email, stating that I needed to call to set up installation and my order was not fully processed. I called and they could not set up an appointment at that time and someone would call me back within 8 hours. No call, so I called them. After 45 minutes or so, I finally got an installation date and was able to access my account online.Second, I was told my package came with DVR but did not received the DVR box. Instead I received two HD boxes. I don't have HD TVs. After spending over two hours chatting with a representative to get a DVR box, I still don't have it because the order did not go through properly and is sitting in their system in limbo (again). Third, I received my first bill and there are two additional installation charges I was never told about or authorized. I was told there was one install fee for the technician to come and install which would be for $39.95. I am also being charged for another install fee of $15 for an additional outlet.
__label__0 Set up to get bundle package and was told by customer service that I would get the same channels.  Tech came to the house but Comcast had not set aside the correct amount of time to trunk over the phone line from Fairpoint, so they gave me a temporary phone number This was incorrect procedure, so they had to cancel my current work order and initiate a NEW work order, thus making me wait 9 more days.  The tech unhooked everything and did notre-establish the phone line in our bedroom, plus we now didn't have The Movie Channel. I called and they kept mtransferring me to the phone tech who told me I would have to wait until my appointment. They showed up in the AFTERNOON, even though I specifically took time off work in the am, so had to RE-SCHEDULE again.  When all iis said and done, I was told The Movie Channel WAS NOT part of the package.  When i complained, the customer service rep REFUSED to let me speak to a superior and I was hung up on TWICE. THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR POOR SERVICE. Once I get Fios in my neighborhood, I will switch and be done with Comcast for good.Missed 2 days work
__label__0  My friends in New Zealand are unable to send me any e-mails over my Comcast internet service. There is no reason for this. I spent a lot of money on Comcast and will be moving to another company after many loyal years.
__label__5 Comcast installed (in our home) their Xfinity home phone and internet service in the week of February 4th. They told my husband and I that it would take about five days for our old phone number to port over from T-mobile to them (Comcast). Today is February 19th and we still have not gotten our old phone number ported over yet, but instead we have what Comcast calls a temporary phone number. Because they have not ported over our old home phone number, we cannot retrieve our phone messages from our old phone number. We would like our old phone number ported over as soon as possible.
__label__1 Comcast is HYPOCRITICAL using credit reporting agencies. While using this practice, Comcast refuses to contribute previous account information on behalf of any customer. Comcast WILL NOT use previous Comcast Customer's Account Information to determine eligibility opening an account. This is REGARDLESS of how good of a customer you were! I had 2 different subscriptions, NEVER missed a payment! Looks like you can miss a payment or more - Comcast doesn't care! Comcast does not use that info anyway!I am demanding, [EVERY COMCAST CUSTOMER SHOULD], Comcast enter previous Comcast Account information in the Credit Reporting Agencies! If Comcast is going to determine a customer's eligibility for an account, using a credit score from one of the three credit reporting agencies! Just tell Comcast if they do not then you will go to another service company. Remember if Comcast will not do as you want - YOU CAN CHANGE! Discrimatory practices for Not Wanting Credit - cash only. (ID Theft 2003 & 2004 - After Chapter 11 - MY debts cleared - Made choice never have credit again - Why make it easy for someone else?!)
__label__1 Comcast has many ways of charging customers and because they don't have direct competitors, they ** the customer. I wanted to try an upgrade for a month to see if I want to keep it and there is no way I can do that. Also, there is a charge for "removing the trap" from the pole outside my home in addition to the upgrade charge. There was no supervisor "available" when I asked to speak to one and I was told that the agent would "submit my request" to speak to a supervisor and they would call me back sometime (no within an hour, etc.). So I could not resolve my issue with Comcast. They are reprehensible in customer relations and obviously are only profit oriented. Believe me, as soon as a decent competitor is available, people will be leaving Comcast in droves. I'll be first in line. All I wanted was to try an upgraded package for a month and I was not allowed to do that and if I upgraded, I would be charged not only for the upgrade, but an additional charge which could not be explained to my satisfaction. Also, I could not speak to a supervisor.
__label__5 Comcast TV, internet, home phone - I switched service from Century Link on 8/4/2011 to Comcast. I am continuing to be billed by Century Link. When I switched, Comcast stated they would take care of paperwork but neither will help with problem after being contacted several times. Both parties are wanting payment. I am paying Comcast for their service. I need help in resolving this problem.
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer for 5 yrs and fortunately have not had any issues recently. It appears that Comcast has outsourced most of its customer service. My internet connection was dropping intermittently for the last 5 days and I called to get some help. My call first went to Mexico and the man there was unable to help me. He transferred me to Mike in the USA and he was able to get my service working again. About 1 hour later the problem started again. I once again called customer service this time ending up in the Philippines. That lady told me she would need to schedule an apt for a technician to come out between 12 and 2 pm. At 2 pm I had not heard from anyone so I called back. This time my call was sent to Columbia. That man told me that the appt. was between 12 and 5pm. Once again I waited and 5pm came and went with no technician at my home and no phone call from Comcast. I called back customer service once again and this time spoke with someone in Panama who told me that my appt. had been cancelled! I asked to speak with a supervisor and was finally transferred to a man in Schaumburg, IL who told me that there was never any appt. scheduled for me and that the information I was given was "fraudulent". Needless to say I'm furious. Comcast makes millions off its customers and should be ashamed of itself for trying to cut cost and send customer service overseas. If I had another option for internet service I would change companies, but I don't have any other options where I'm located! Beware of terrible customer service and of bold face lies from this company!
__label__0 We were transferring our service to our new home.  A three-hour window was given for Friday, 7/1/11, between 11-2.  No call, no show.  So we called them and were told they were so sorry and they would send our concern to dispatch.  Dispatch called at 3 and they said they were so sorry, their serviceman was just leaving a job that had held him up and he would be here soon.  They called at 5 pm and said they were so sorry but their serviceman was still at the other job but would be here between 5 and 6.  No call, no show.  Called back and they said they were so sorry, they will check and that they didn't know what happened and they'd send this over to dispatch.  Dispatch called and you guessed it, they said "so sorry" but he will be there by 7 pm.  No call, no show.  We called again, and they said, "So sorry but he has not been put in a cancel notice so he 'must' be coming. No, we didn't know when, I understand you were upset and I would be, too.  Yes, I can have a supervisor call you back."The time, oh it will be one to two hours!  For the third time, they will credit my bill whole $20.  Wow.  Serviceman finally got here at 7:30 pm, saying, "So sorry.  Yes, I had your number but no, dispatch was supposed to call."  Did I hear from a supervisor?  You guessed it, "NO".    
__label__1 I do not even have a service yet. Its been two weeks. I am waiting everyday for a technician to come and check the connection outside. The in their box and every day are apologizing and understanding my pain. Yet no ** comes.
__label__0 Comcast is the worst of the worst.  Our house is quite large so we need two connections to get all the TVs.  One line was sitting 1 inch below the ground and when the big truks came to pick up the leaf piles twice a year, this cable is invaribly damaged.  It is often two or three visits just to get them to fix it.  We asked them to bury it and they said OK but the ground team has to come.  After 2 calls the ground team came and buried the cable aboout 1 and 1/2 inches at best and it took all day.  We complained 4 times until they came back and reburied it about 1 and 3/4 inches.  You could kick the dirt and expose the cable.  The next time the leaf trucks came, no service for half the house again.  I asked them if they could run a cable in the attic to connect the other part of the house to the good cable.  They said they don't do that.  I asked who does and they said they did not know.  This was two years ago.  They are so frightfully inept and confused that I have given up.  I can no longer stomach comversation with these people who could obviously not care less.  When they call me with promotions for phone and internet, I just laugh and say no thank you. The only damage is to their reputation which apparently is so bad that my problem matters not at all.
__label__0 About 18 mos ago we bought a HD television so that we could get a brighter clearer TV as my husband has failing eyesight.  We were told by Comcast that HD would come by Feb 2009.  Indeed it has come even sooner Jume 2008) and though it was advertised as being in our area it is NOT coming here.  It is NOT coming here ever. No one at Comcast can tell us why and we spent gobs of money for the TV set up for HD TV.  We are so angry because we have no other options to get HD for our TV.       The other aspect about Comcast is that their technical support and customer service is so bad we frequently have to spend half a day just to find out something as simple as You have no email because hackers got into our servers.  Then when the servers are fixed in some kind of ritualistic rotation, it finally gets to us 3 days after it gets to a town (Indiana, PA) 30 miles down the road.        The damage may be great as my husband was planning to use the TV as a very large screen for his writing. The other damage is psychological...Comcast clearly sees us living in a poor area and will not fund what is necessary to get HD up here yet we have a commerical account for a stable ISP address because of my work.
__label__1 In June I received a phone call about upgrading to the Xfinity Comcast X1. Going over all the "Extras" the rep told me that my total bill would be $160.00 and some change. With this I got HBO and Starz, Home phone and internet "at the highest speed" (did NOT notice a difference). Then one month goes by, we got the bill... Lo and behold it was just under $300 (289.15 to be exact). We then called Comcast to try to understand why the bill was so high. On hold for 10 to 15 minutes we get a rep and he told us it was due to the charges for the install of the X1 system. They call it pro-rated charges. I then continued to tell him the rep I had talked to in June said that it would not have any charges for the install or the new system. I then asked to be connected to a Supervisor then was told NO and that he was the only person that I could talk to. (Call was around 2:00pm CST.) Then I asked a second time and was hung up on.Then I decided to phone back to Comcast, this time I received someone that was either new to Comcast or was very good at turning my words. (Nickname for rep: The Snake.) As we talked I told her what I had expected and what my previous calls contained before I had the X1 system. Then she told My Wife and I that we were experiencing such a high bill because we missed a payment. Due to having Chase bank we went through our bill and found out that we had paid the previous bill in full. (Sent Over to Rep to confirm.)At this point I was completely frustrated... So I then asked "The Snake" what would it take just to cancel everything with Comcast, then she had said "Well sir there would be a fee to cancel your service of $328.19." Fully knowing that we no longer had a contact with Comcast... I asked her why does she have to lie. That she knows that I no longer have a termed contract with Comcast. Proceeded to ask for a Supervisor.Finally thought I got someone on the phone that would help me further understand my bill. NOPE! The supervisor got on the phone and said that he was very sorry for all the instances that happened to us. That he would go ahead and change the bill back to the way it was prior to getting the new "X1 entertainment". That he would change the bill. "Sir & mam I just wanted to let you know that because of this change in your bill, it will take a few days to reflect in your billing cycle." Me: "Perfect and thanks for everything that you have done." END OF CALL...Today 3 days after the phone call my wife calls me at work. "Babe did you see our Comcast bill." "No why what is wrong?" IT'S $550!!! WHAT!? THE quote unquote supervisor took the New bill and our old bill and just stacked them! Comcast has the worst Customer service! Please DO NOT GO WITH COMCAST FOR ANYTHING!! THEY ARE 100% LIARS AND CON ARTISTS TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK! WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!
__label__1 Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Comcast is awful!!! The cable goes in and out.. The guide will not load most of the time and Xfinity on demand never even works. EVERY person I have talked to about fixing the cable when it was going in and out was rude! When we moved and had to switch apartments they automatically assumed because my husband is Spanish that he wanted the Spanish package (I don't even speak Spanish so I couldn't watch half the channels) or maybe they got the orders mixed up. Either way it was Comcast's mistake. When he called and told them he never ordered that package or that specific box and he wanted the same thing he had before they finally agreed it was THEIR mistake and said they would send a tech. Out free of charge because it was THEIR fault. After the tech came the bill came and they had charged us and we called them, they said they had never said that because "there were no notes put into the computer". (whose fault is that? How convenient they just didn't put any notes.) We ended up paying for comcast's mistake. BS. I can't wait to switch back to Verizon FiOS!!!!
__label__1 I am a new Comcast customer, as of 9/15/2015 it's been 38 days I am their customer and I have spent more than 35 hours with them on the phone resolving issues with their cable TV. First they send bad equipment, then their customer service does not understand the issue, after several days they conclude it's the X1 device and they send me new one, that worked for 5 days and quit, now the real nightmare starts. They have no idea what's going on and sends a technician, the technician checks the wires and replaces the X1 device again, works for 2 days and then the same issue, does not connect to comcast services.I call them again and the same story continues, this story went on for 38 days and after 4 X1 devices I still don't have TV, my Internet works fine but the problem is with the TV, they keep saying it's my wiring issue and the technician says otherwise. I ask the customer service to cancel my account because it's just been 38 days and the service never worked, they say I have to pay $250 early termination fee. Guys, I plead you to avoid this company, go elsewhere or just enjoy Netflix and Hulu. These people are parasites and you will end up with agony and several days on the phone with their arrogant idiotic customer service. YOU SUCK COMCAST.
__label__1 We had contacted Xfinity/Comcast to set up a thermostat that would allow us to remotely set the temperature of our home on 3/19/2015. They were supposed to come on 3/21/2015 to install the thermostat but never showed. On 3/23/2015, my husband contacted them again to set an appointment. The customer service representatives were unable to provide a reason for their missed appointment that Saturday. We set another appointment for 3/24/2015 between 1PM and 3PM. The technician did not show up until 6:30 PM. He started working on the thermostat but, when asked how much longer it would take (around 8PM), the technician said that he was almost done but that we wouldn't be able to get heat because "the lines were backwards." The technician was getting ready to leave our residence, knowing that we had no heat. My husband asked him to replace the original thermostat as it would be about 32 degrees and we have four children (two 8-year olds, one 6-year old, and a 6-month old). He worked on the original thermostat for about half an hour and then left our residence without notice. The heat was not connected to the thermostat and the thermostat was hanging off of the wall when he left. After multiple attempts to contact Xfinity/Comcast, we were unable to get another technician to our residence and it was unclear whether or not they would bill us for the "service." They also refused to provide a name or ID for the technician so we could file a formal complaint. My husband was on hold for almost an hour and a representative disconnected the call twice. We had to call an emergency service to fix our thermostat and hook it up to the heat which costed $75.
__label__5 About a month ago, I began having difficulty with my internet connection. So, I carried my laptop to a local coffee shop, and set up a connection there. Problem solved. Then, I called Comcast and spoke with a technician (in the Philippines). They sent out a technician to look at my Comcast equipment and connection. He informed me that the problem "must be my computer, because the equipment seems to be fine." So, I arranged with a professional technician to check my computer. It turns out that the problem was indeed with the Comcast box. The router part of the box was going bad. When I called Comcast again, they told me I would have to come pick up a new box myself and hook it up myself. So many problems, so much cost, so little service!
__label__0 Just the worst customer service and lack of taking responsibility for their mistakes I have ever seen. As a new customer initially for internet and cable, the screw ups began with late for the installation and over billing were somewhat fixable but clearly a pain in the **. Now comes the migration to their phone service because my soon to be ex-wife wanted the phone services out of her name. Thus migrating the home number from T-Mobile home service to Comcast. I gave Comcast 10 days notice and informed T-Mobile of the transition. Comcast was called 3 times to confirm the transfer of the number from T-Mobile to Comcast. All three times, everything was confirmed for a transfer on the date of installation. When the service technician showed up with the new modem he had an entirely new number and knew nothing about the old number that was to be used. Subsequent calls to customer service and being put on hold for over 35 minutes only resulted in an insincere, "Gees... were sorry," and the fact that they never did what they said they were going to do. It will take 5-10 days for them to contact T-Mobile and make the change. There was/is no making up for their mistake and no promise that they will get the job done as promised. These ** guys suck and if you have a choice for other providers in your area, use them.
__label__1 How can America and Americans can be soo STUPID to keep this Company in existence. No country in the world can SCAM its citizens like this. Each time I have to Call and fix the astronomically high bill. They say it's fixed but I know and they know that it will continue.
__label__1 When I signed up for Comcast, I was told my bill would be 118 monthly. I expected the first bill to be off due to prorated charges BUT 254 for my first bill is INSANE!!! That's more than 2 months worth of services. There is no reason why I should be charged for 2 months. Not to mention the internet services sucks! I could never log on without my internet going out for 10 minutes at a time. The cable was bad too. People think only satellite freezes up and goes out. NO! MY cable would go out and freeze up for no reason at all...no explanation, no bad weather, nothing. They sent a tech out and he couldn't figure out the problem with my internet so that was never fixed. I never do reviews but I'm just so unsatisfied with this product, it's UNREAL.
__label__1 I pay over $300 a month for the bundle service - cable TV, telephone and internet. I have three televisions on HD cable and pay extra for each of the HD boxes. The biggest problem we have is with the internet service. The service will all of a sudden disconnect from the Internet. When you troubleshoot the problem, it will say check your modem/router connections, which I have done. We have several computers in the house and the disconnect does not happen all at once - it is random on each computer. It would seem to me if there was a router/modem connection problem that they would all go down at the same time. You can be responding to an email and go to send your response - no connection. I have tried to contact customer service and have not been connected. I tried to email them two days ago and my entire email system went down and I did not receive emails yesterday. I have not called because I know they will say it is my equipment and we will have to buy new/pay for a service visit. We have been customers of Comcast since they first entered the market here over 25 years ago. We are starting to look at other options. I am tired of being held hostage. If it were just me, I would disconnect everything but I have a sports fanatic and grandchildren who watch on-demand and cartoon network.
__label__1 Got to work on January 20th. Found out we had no phone or Internet service. Called Comcast, they said they are working on it and would be restored before 3pm. Which by the nature of our business is too far a stretch. Called them again at 3pm, they said they would be sending a technician out within an hour. I called them an hour later, they said the earliest time they have available is the following day the 21st, not in the morning, not in the afternoon but between 4 and 9pm. In essence they are telling us to come in and sit down for another whole day not able to fill prescriptions, customers cannot pick up their medicines because there is no register to ring them up or counsel them, we can not receive prescriptions from doctors offices because no fax, no Internet for electronic prescriptions, no phone was working. Tried to make them realize the damage they're causing to my business but that would not even move them to get us a technician. If there is a star below 1 star that is what I would have given. Comcast does not care if they put us out of business, send all our customers to competitors but they are quick to send you monthly bills. I am really disgusted with this company and their lack of concerns for people's plight. I do not know how many customers we have lost to competitors in a span of 48 hours. What is the lifetime value of those customers? Only time would tell. We will start exploring our options too.
__label__1 You use their modem, you get charged $10 every month. Still you don't have good connection and can't use the Internet if you not buy the modem. You pay for a 75mega bytes speed, you get less than 30, you get upset and tired of calling them everyday and decide to buy your own modem and router. You mess up your speed even more and with on and off Internet connection and when you call them, they tell you it's your router (that are very new) or your laptop that is just 3 days old. I can't seem to use any other company here because Comcast monopolized the service here in Rockford IL.
__label__0 A sales rep. came to my door, gave me information and then asked if he could come in, and I said no. I took the information and said I would look into it and if interested I would call. He then came back to my home a few days later at 8:00 pm, then again on Saturday around 1:00 pm. I did not answer the door on either occasion.Again this Saturday, 9-25-2010, around 1:00 in the afternoon, I was in my garage and my neighbors came over and this Comcast rep pulls in my drive way and when he saw me and my neighbors, he pulled out of my drive way. I told my neighbors who he was and they stated that he has been at my home several times when I wasn't home. I went in the house and called Comcast to file a complaint. I had to call 3 times and was put on hold from 25 to 40 minutes each time and then finally the said they would have a supervisor call me before 5:00 pm. They took all the information regarding the complaint and my address. I heard them typing this call took about 20 minutes. No one called me.I called again on Monday, 9-27-2010. I couldn't get a supervisor, called again today, 9-28-2010, and told them if a supervisor did not get on the line now, I would contact the newspaper, TV and my attorney regarding this serious matter. I finally spoke with a Salvadore and he said that he would take all the info and pass it along to his boss and they will start an investigation, he gave me a case ticket number. I don't believe this because he said there was nothing in the system regarding me ever calling on Saturday. This company to me is really something and doesn't care about the people out there, especially when they are single women like myself who is being stalked by one of their employees.
__label__1 I moved out of my earlier house, gave Comcast a fair warning. They agreed to suspend service, wanted their equipment back. They give me locations to drop off the equipment, I was unable to do that because of the move. A couple of months later they come in collected their equipment. Then they send me refund check of $48.95 in Feb of this year. Account closed! Today I find out that my Comcast had reported me to a collections agency and the report is still open. I'm trying to buy a house & my credit score is badly affected!! I cannot buy!! All because Comcast has been callous and not reported to the agency that all debt is cleared! I have been on the phone for 3 hours right now being moved from Dept to Dept & country to country!!!
__label__1 They will change your services without notice and charge you more. Also, they know there are no other providers in my area so they have jacked up prices to a lot more than TWC or FIOS customers pay anywhere for LESS service. I googled and found out that there had been a class action lawsuit 15 years ago exactly for this reason but somehow COMCAST managed to drag it along for 12 years then paying nothing.
__label__1 Problem with my TV pixelating. About 25+ phone calls to Comcast located everywhere but in the United States. After no resolution of the problem and the exchange of 2 Xfinity cable boxes, the lack of customer service only got worse. The second cable box and remote I was given I took home and setup. The remote control would only work the volume... nothing else.I went to Comcast the next morning and was given a replacement remote I was assured would work correctly. Before I left Comcast, I put the batteries in it, looked up the code for the TV they have in their lobby, and tried out the remote. It would only control the volume. When I went back to the "customer service" girl who gave the remote and pointed that out to her, she replied "Oh, that remote won't work with the box you have. Here's the right remote." It is no wonder that Comcast has no customer service middle or upper management people you can talk to about poor service experiences. THEY JUST DON'T CARE!
__label__1 I was charged for service when I had cancelled my service AND returned all of my equipment. This is after over a decade of being a customer. I had several experiences of being setup with a completely different package than I had requested. The customer service I received from the outbound collection service was HORRIBLE! I will NEVER go with Comcast again. I aim to find a company that appreciates a loyal customer. They will have the next ten years of my business.
__label__1 They owe me about $5800 for my overpayment and I cannot get phone calls/emails returned even though they promised a check within 10 days on October 2. Will not let me talk to a supervisor. It is incredibly frustrating and all I get now is the runaround. Can you help? Yes, $5800!
__label__0 I ordered service (Internet and digital cable) from Comcast when I moved here mid-December 2008. This is where the problems began. Setting up the Internet service on their network required installation of software on my computer. Fortunately, I had the software monitored as it was installing so that I could fully remove it afterwards. This software installation requirement means that an end user cannot use Linux as their only platform when activating service with Comcast.Nothing in the DOCSIS specification forces end users onto a particular operating system, nor should it. Within the first 72 hours of activating service, I was losing connectivity to the Comcast network, but not in the sense of the modem or the router losing connectivity. Instead, the Comcast network kept trying to force me through their self-installation mechanisms as though their network forgot my modem's DOCSIS mac address.For the next three months, I would lose connectivity, but not by the loss of communication with the modem. Instead, the Comcast CMTS would refuse to communicate with my router (or PC, when connected directly) regardless of the lease time remaining on the DHCP assignment from Comcast's CMTS. Starting in March, the only change was the duration before I would have to reset my equipment to maintain connectivity. That time frame went from losing connectivity every seven days to every four days.This all changed from being an annoyance to a borderline complete service interruption on August 16, 2009 at 7:30 pm EDT. At this time, I lost connectivity and had to restart my router before the CMTS would give a new address. Following this reboot, I am now losing connectivity every 1 hour and 45 minutes, give or take two minutes (though this two-minute window may have to do with the time it takes to reboot my equipment and obtain a new lease).Currently, the 1 hour and 45 minute window means that to maximize my network connectivity, I would have to reboot my network on average 13 times a day, which by any reasonable person's standards would be considered completely unacceptable. Additionally, this reboot must be done manually as the Comcast CMTS is not permitting a DHCP release and renew, which means that any equipment that follows the RFCs related to DHCP (or it's predecessor BOOTP) must either get a successful release or wait for the lease timeout before the new lease (in this case 30 days). Under these circumstances, without manual intervention on my part, I would have Internet access for 1 hour and 45 minutes out of every 30 days.I contacted Comcast about the connectivity issues and was told that an appointment could be set up for Tuesday of next week at the earliest, even though they do see that I am receiving a poor signal from their network. This precise change from exactly four days between reboots to precisely 1 hour 45 minutes is just too exact to be related to a physical network problem - and instead screams of a configuration issue on Comcast's network. This is especially evident considering there were no changes on my network to coincide with this severe reduction in an already poor quality and overpriced service.Now, for some background on my networking history:I have worked in telecommunications as a technician for the last decade (full 10 years) and am Cisco-certified. Additionally, I work for an ISP and perform both installs and re-grooms on ATM, Frame Relay, VPN, and MPLS private networks, in addition to Internet connections with or without BGP for customers with circuit sizes ranging from 56k up to bonded 10GigE and everything in-between.I have also had cable Internet service with the following previous providers (based upon my residence at the time): Cable One, Charter, Time Warner, and now, Comcast. Over that history of Internet access, I have tried various routers from several different vendors and the current router and modem have operated successfully for months on end (longer than the DHCP lease time for each of those networks) without the necessity to reboot my equipment (modem or router) at any time besides those of my own choosing while operating on All of those cable providers listed previously except for Comcast. It has only been since operating on Comcast's network that it has been necessary to constantly reboot.
__label__1 I've just been trying to change service over from my mother (who is 80 something and is losing it as well as being in the hospital) to my name so I can pay the bills. So far, it's taken over 6 months and we're nowhere closer to finding a solution. Everyone tells you a different story and no one knows what they are doing. Do yourself a favor and get whatever other carrier you can.
__label__1 After a hurricane in August 2011, it knocked all the wires down, and until now, it's not yet repaired. We have reported this 4 times already. We are concerned that the wires on the ground will fail, this winter or earlier. Our business depends on telephone and internet. We are a fully computerized medical practice, in a building with many others; we only depend on Comcast, the only provider available.
__label__1 The tv shuts down every night and only thing they tell me is it's a required maintenance... I mean really do you have to reboot an entire WAN every night?
__label__0 I have been a Comcast customer for many years. We do not have many choices for cable providers, so it is either Comcast or the Dish Network. After having a tree limb fall on our power lines, the electric service had to come and cut all the lines leading to our home, including the cable line. Within a couple of hours our electricity had been restored. I then called Comcast to tell them that I would need someone to come and repair our cable lines. I was told that it would be 48 hours to get someone to our home. I was not pleased with this response, but I agreed.Now 48 hours, 4 phone calls and one internet chat later, I still have no service. I was promised at 4:40 pm today that someone would definitely be out to restore our service only to find out their office closes at 5:00 pm. Now this leads me to believe that this supervisor (Ed) made a promise just to get me off of the phone. I am still sitting here, 3 hours later with no cable service. I pay over $220 a month for all the HD, internet, DVR and special perks of this cable company. This is horrible customer service and if people had other options they could boycott Comcast and put them out of business. I am over these big companies treating the hard working people of this country like this. Now just speaking to the call center, they again apologized for the confusion. So, this is not fair.
__label__0    I have been a Comcast customer since they took over my previous provider.  So about 6 years now.  For the past two months, my service (cable, phone & internet.) have been non usable.  I called Comcast the first I noticed this.  They said they would send a technician to my home to see what was going on.  Well the day came and gone that the tech was to come out.  The problem is getting worse.  So I call again and reschedule.  Again the day comes and goes.  So by now I am very annoyed!  I call again.  They claim he came out and no one was home.  I said not true.  I took off work and was home all day as well as my wife who works from home.  The customer service rep argued with me to the point I hung up.  I thought was petty to fight about. So I call back and got another appointment scheduled.  The day comes and the tech actually shows up!!  He discovered a my cable box was defective and the line running into my house was bad.  He fixed it the best he could, until they could replace the line.  Comcast calls me the next day to let me know that on November 22nd they will be repairing my line outside.  I said GREAT!  Well the 22nd comes and goes. No repair. Mean while I'm paying 160 a month for nothing.  I call back to find out what is going on.  The rep puts me on hold for 20 minutes.  She returns saying, when a truck in available they will be out.  I said WHAT?!  You gave me a date and time.  She said they never did.  I said fine. A week goes by nothing.  I call back. Talk to a rep who gives me an excuse "when we get permission from the twp. We can then do the repair." I said ok this is new.  I call my twp office.  They told me they gave them the go ahead a week ago.  So I call Comcast back.  I was on the phone for an hour, arguing trying to get this repaired.  The rep told me I was inconsiderate, knew nothing about my services and hung up on me. At this point I looked up the local office here for Comcast.  I drive there and had to pretend I was a delivery person to get in the building.  I find the office and ask to speak to someone in charge.  A gentle men comes and talks with me.  I explain to him the situation and how I was getting the run around and treated.  He said there is nothing he can do.  I asked for a credit on my bill since I paid for service I cannot use.  He credited me a whole 36.88!  I told him to eat his credit and canceled service.  I ordered Verizon and Love them.  I will never use Comcast again!So by now I am very annoyed!  I call again.  They claim he came out and no one was home.  I said not true.  I took off work and was home all day as well as my wife who works from home.  The customer service rep argued with me to the point I hung up.  I thought was petty to fight about. So I call back and got another appointment scheduled.

I ordered Verizon and Love them.  I will never use Comcast again!So I call Comcast back.  I was on the phone for an hour, arguing trying to get this repaired.  The rep told me I was inconsiderate, knew nothing about my services and hung up on me. At this point I looked up the local office here for Comcast.  I drive there and had to pretend I was a delivery person to get in the building.  I find the office and ask to speak to someone in charge.  A gentle men comes and talks with me.  I explain to him the situation and how I was getting the run around and treated.  He said there is nothing he can do.  I asked for a credit on my bill since I paid for service I cannot use.  He credited me a whole 36.88!  I told him to eat his credit and canceled service.  I ordered Verizon and Love them.  I will never use Comcast again!
__label__1 Yet again I've experienced horrible Comcast customer service. (again and again and again) I was online with a very helpful tech for 2 hours trying to resolve an issue (got bounced to several people and finally ended up with the helpful tech) and the chat got disconnected. I told him/her that my computer gave me a signal that the chat would disconnect if I did what they wanted me to do. They said no they would not be disconnected, but yes they were. They were given a phone number when the chat started but no call and I have no way to contact the tech which means I have to start the discussion all over with a new person. You would think given the fact that I said i think I might lose you they would have called me on the number they were given. I'm trying to connect online to watch the Olympics. Guess that's not going to happen. Because I don't have 2 hours to start over. I was trying to watch people I actually know compete. As usual you can't count on Comcast. I have no choice but to use them in DC, so they don't have to provide any service.
__label__1 Have a service with condo association - worst service ever. When I call their line, it always repeat itself and once I finally reach the end of giving my number, address and so forth, 4 times around, it hangs up. Now I have an issue with the operators. They can never find any notes of previous calls made - very frustrating. I asked for a copy of our discussion. I was told they dont do that. Each person I talk to does always says the person before them made a mistake and they are SORRY as if that resolves my problem. I had a fraudulent fees on my account of 157.00 and since then they froze my account. Now this was supposedly taken care of last year but someone did not do their job and cancelled the ticket order because they did not see all the contact number rectified that I provided and simply left the account in jeopardy. This been going on for a year now even when I talked to managers like Luisa by email --no answer. Spend 6 hours on the phone with 6 different department, having some deep hang up till I got someone yesterday who put a new tickets verification on. Meanwhile no service or no new service and I need internet.
__label__0 I have 2 laptops connected wirelessly to a Comcast modem for internet service.  Hereinafter referred to as Modem 1  On or about 6/23/08, a Comcast Technician came into my home and installed a second modem to connect directly to a third computer in the home.  Hereinafter referred to as Modem 2  On 6/24/08, while Modem 1 was functioning, neither laptop was able to access the internet.  After an approximate 2.5 hour conversation with Comcast IT employees, Modem 1 was provisioned and access was restored. Provisioning of Modem 1 was at approx. 11:00 pm.  On 6/25/08 at approx. 7:15 am, Modem 1 was still working.  On 6/25/08 at approx. 8:00 pm, Modem 1 again would not permit access to the internet by either laptop.  Additionally, Modem 2 was not permitting access for the entire day.  During the day on 6/25/08, a representative of Comcast advised that Comcast always has problems with more than one modem installed in a household due to their computer system.   After approximate 3 hours on the phone with Cecil and Eric of Comcast during the evening of 6/25/08, neither modem could be effectively provisioned.    As of 6/26/08, I still have no connection to the internet, with an appointment for a representative to come out on 6/27/08 between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., for which I will be missing time from work.  In addition, during telephone conversations on 6/24 and 6/25 with representatives of Comcast, I was mistransferred a minimum of 4 separate occasions during each phone call thereby placing my call back into queue, Hello and thank you for calling Comast. Press 1 for English...  I then had to repeat myself from the beginning for each separate representative.  Comcast knowingly, maliciously and frauduently sold a contract for an additional modem knowing full well that Comcast would be unable to provide service for both modems as was so confirmed.  Additionally, by the adding of the second modem, existing internet service ceased to function completely.  Over five hours on the phone with representatives during the course of two evenings proved absolutely fruitless.  I am losing time and money with no connection to the internet.  I maintain an online business where response time is of the essence.  I am unable to respond to potential customers and existing clients thereby causing me great detriment.
__label__1 We have basic cable thru Comcast. We pay $83.00 a month for this service so we can have a wireless TV and Computers. At least three to four times a month we have the speed of: Bing 97, Download .81Mbps and Upload of 1.36 Mbps. When called, you are on hold (with the worst music) forever. When they do come on the line they try to overwhelm you with their technical knowledge. (Speak English, I am not impressed!) I just want what I am paying for. How do we get what we are paying for?
__label__1 I am a snowbird and spend half my year in Florida and the other half in Massachusetts. In May I left Florida from Massachusetts and put my account on hold but paid $15 a month so that when I got back to Florida in the fall they would automatically hook my TV and everything back up to where it was originally, including original prices and selections. I called Comcast in August, 2 weeks before returning back to Florida and asked that my cable phone and Internet be turned back on Sept 9th, a day before I got home. When I got home my cable was not working. I called customer service told them that I was on the summer plan and that they should have hooked my service is back up already. They finally got my cable going yet had none of the channels that I originally had, therein they did not go back to my original plan.After 4 more phone calls and getting me hooked up with a brand new plan, which is not what I wanted, I had to call back again to specify that I wanted my original plan back. I just received my first bill since coming back to Florida and it is $265! They charge me $20 more than my original plan and also charge me $97 to switch plans which I did not do. So I just spent an hour and 45 minutes being passed around from customer service to billing with no one taking the responsibility of who needs to help me resolve this matter. I have never in my life dealt with such incompetence!! If my account is not fixed within the next day I'm canceling my service and going to make sure I tell all my friends and family to cancel also. For multi million, probably billion, dollar company they should be ashamed and embarrassed at the ineptitude of their staff!!!
__label__1 Lousy would be insult to the word lousy. They are ** of the Earth. I can't believe this company is still in business. I have a house in Florida and decided to get triple services as we were going to be there for one week on vacation. I live in NJ and have Cablevision and compared to Comcast, they are an angel. I made an appointment from NJ to get phone and internet installed and decided to get one HD box. The technician came without HD box, so I called Comcast and every time different people came on the phone and gave different information about services and rates and nobody would confirm the appointment. Comcast would just say, 'We don't have any record'. Finally, the technician did come on Saturday. I can't wait to get Verizon FiOS or any other cable company in Florida in my area. What is wrong with Comcast? First, the company gets work thru contractors and contractors have sub-contractors.One hand doesn't know what other hand is doing and we, customers suffer. I would like to write a nasty gram to Comcast directly. Once I moved to Florida for good, I will get satellite and get everything thru them or different cable company.
__label__5 I have been having some issues with Comcast customer support. We have had service with them for well over 10 years, and our price continues to raise every year! I called to inquire about cutting back at least a few of my premium channels, and they said I would see the rate on the other channels go up, leaving me with the same monthly bill. The CSR was rude, and he obviously didn't care about my needs as a customer. In my opinion they are becoming the worst type of monopoly!
__label__1 Comcast service is absolutely horrendous. We continually have slow internet, problems with connecting to on demand service. Have had the cable box replaced at least 3 times. You can NEVER speak with any person in the US, wait times are always long, you are never allowed to speak with a supervisor AND when we demand a correction on our bill for charges when we have had no service they want US to call them back to connect to a different dept to request a refund!! They are the WORST for service and customer service. I hate Comcast. I am a working person and DO NOT have time to sit on the phone for 30 minutes or more during my work day!!!!
__label__0 I had set my TiVo to record Globe Trekker, for the episode including Iran. Guess what happened? ONE HOUR OF BLACKED-OUT PROGRAMMING!GREAT IDEA, COMRAD-CAST!I was unable to watch the episode I was looking forward to viewing. Why should Comcast use their prehistoric political angles to keep me from watching a program that encourages viewers to get along with the rest of the world?! There has to be a legal precedent involved in this kind of instance.
__label__0 We made 2 check payments for our MI comcast account but have accidentally mailed it to their Seattle PO box, which is for CA accounts. the checks has a complete information in which account we are trying to pay, but they applied it to our Comcast CA account which is so stupid because it doesnt even match the amount of our CA Comcast bill. So I have to call MI comcast and told them about this, I even called CA comcast to have that payment taken out of our CA account, a supervisor told me she'll take care of it to be applied for our MI comcast account. But 4 weeks have passed and never this problem, I have called them every single day. They have disconnected the service, we have to pay by credit card, they charges disconnection fee, and they kept wasting my time for at least 30 mins to more than an hour every single day.
__label__1 First off, I've been without internet for a week and on demand for a week as well. So I call the second day after nothing worked the first day to schedule a visit and the automated system kept saying that there was an outage in my area and it'll be resolved by 12:36. So I call later that afternoon and tell them and they try to send signals to the modem or whatever and it wouldn't work. So we scheduled a visit for that Friday between 10-12. Mind you that the first option they gave me was for the following freaking Monday and I said HECK NO that is way too long, I have a business to run.So the guy came on Friday at 1:30 NOT between 10-12 because I saw him pull up, he sat there for like 20 minutes and when I looked again he was freaking gone! So now I'm a little hot, so I call and ask what the heck is going on and why'd he just leave and the lady said, "Well there's another outage in your area and he wouldn't have been able to do anything but he should have at least came to your door and told you but he didn't". So later we rescheduled another appointment for Sunday between 3-4 and confirmed it.So I don't go to church. I'm here waiting on them to come and it's 4 and all call like, "Where are you guys?" And this lady on the phone tells me that it has been rescheduled for freaking Tuesday! I'm like WTF! Seriously! How the heck can you just do that?!! She said that after further checking for like 10 mins that the local office called to reschedule but no one picked up so we couldn't confirm. I was like, "But you just said it's scheduled for Tuesday so how the heck did you confirm that if no one picked up?" They didn't call by the way. So you just don't come?? You cancel it on your own and don't freaking show up?!! She said "yes ma'am that's correct..." So I'm pissed by now and then she says that someone will call me back by 6 with a rescheduled... No one has called!!! This isn't the first time something like this has happened... But I can guarantee it'll be the last... I'M GOING WITH DIRECT!!! 
__label__0 I am being charged for services when my services would be interrupted by them repairing services, indispute with Fox network, when service is failure to dig up cable line,weather condition cause cable interruption, this is the reason I switch my telephone and internet due to these poor working conditons, thenb I notified the company I would be switiching to another provider due to the poor services.
__label__0    1st of all my cable started out being $129.00 a month then it jumped to $227 a month. I requested several times for a technichion to come out & when he did come it was two hours later. My dvr & two cable boxws hasn't work for over six months. Thats ridiculious how much the bill is every month & they would'nt compisate us for our cable not working & not telling us that the cable services went up extremely high! & our computer iternet is very slow....
__label__0 What a mistake they were nothing like I thought for a internet provider. We always had service interruptions and slow speeds. Come to find out they had to take a trap off our line to be close to the speed that we were supposed to get and after a month they tried to charge us for more TV channels. The funny thing is we do not have any TVs in the house so finally after 3 months they removed the price difference but never gave is credit for it. Also if you do not pay them right away they turn you in to a credit service and trash your credit even if it was their mistake about the billing, I know this because it happened to me 7 times and even tho they issue was taken care of and yes a 7 times were errors on there side my credit is still tarnished from this to this day. Oh and by the way it was not like we were out in the sticks, we were located less than 6 miles from the main Comcast building.After 5 months those smart asses came back out and put the trap back on the line and did not tell us and flat out denied it when I asked them but I could see the trap on the cable up on the pole. After I told them that they were full of it they fessed up after about an hour. I was out of service for the total of 41 days in a 1 year time and many service glitches. It never would surprise me when I came home from work and found out that I had no internet. Finally in April 2008 we were pleased to find out that AT&T Uverse was available with high speed internet in my area.We called them and it was hooked up in less than 5 business days and running. Since then we only had 2outages and they lasted no longer that a few minutes and the speeds are much faster than Comcast ever was. Customer support is really good threw AT&T also. Biggest thing is about Comcast is they will keep changing and raising your bill and you never know month to month of what it will be.About a month ago we had new families move in to the neighborhood and I told them the horror stories about Comcast. All the families except for 1 went with AT&T except for my next door neighbor but after a month of horrible service and outages he went with AT&TAfter 5 months those smart asses came back out and put the trap back on the line and did not tell us and flat out denied it when I asked them but I could see the trap on the cable up on the pole.

__label__1 In Massachusetts, in bill dated November 27th, Comcast gave notice of price increase effective December 11, 2014. That is very short notice of time. Comcast refuses to reply to me as to why the short time. I am interested in finding out if this is Comcast's policy in the other states. So I am asking people to respond by identifying their state and advising the date of the most recent price increase notice they have received from Comcast and the date of that price increase takes effect in their billing process. In short: date you received notice + date your bank or credit card was debited for the increase. So that this site is not filled with numerous duplicate responses from the same state, please check the answers to see if someone in your state has already responded before you answer.
__label__0 I bundled my services under the 'triple-play' deal from Comcast. Cable tv, Internet, and phone, all for 99.99. When I first switched, I was overcharged 10 dollars a month, so I called and was told that whoever set up my account did so incorrectly and the only way to fix it was to add a recurring 10 dollar rebate to my account. What struck me as funny is that the 10 dollar rebate showed up in the 'one time fees' are of my bill. So I have a recurring one-time fee each month now. When I signed up for automatic billing my bill jumped again. I called and was told that someone had made an error and my bill was corrected. When I signed up for paperless billing my bill jumped again. I called and got the same answer, someone had made a mistake and it was corrected. A few months back I noticed my bill had jumped again and called, they fixed the problem as usual but I'd had enough so I canceled. Then I was charged 50$. I called and was told someone had made a mistake and it will be taken care of. While I was diligent enough to prevent any damages I find it almost impossible that simply as a coincidence each time I did something that made it less likely that I would scrutinize my bill (auto pay, e-bill) I was overcharged.
__label__1 Their customer service reps and their loyal team don't know what the hell they are doing! Comcast likes to take it upon themselves and charge you double the amount for the same services you have been getting for the past year. No courtesy call or letter a few months before to give you an option to pick another plan, instead they make your choice for you.
__label__0 I only purchased high-speed internet through Comcast, but decided to bundle with another company. They cancelled the account and mailed a box to me so that I could return the modem. The box did not come with further instructions, just the UPS return label. I placed the modem in the box and took it to the UPS store on April 1, 2009. I received a bill for $66 shortly after, but the rep assured me that the charges would drop off once the modem was returned. A few weeks later, I got another bill. So I called and the rep asked when I had mailed the package and what the tracking number was. I did not have it on me at the time, so he told me to call back and provide it. I did the next business day, but this rep said, "We don't need the tracking number; we got it already because we gave it to you!" She assured me that the charge would be adjusted off once the box was scanned. The next month, I received another bill from Comcast and a collections letter from a company they hired regarding the $66. I called Comcast on 6/6/09 and the rep told me to go to my nearest customer center and give them the receipt. I did that, but the rep at the center said he couldn't help me because the modem number is not on the receipt. I tried to make it clear that I returned the modem in the box provided to me, not a brick! He again stated he couldn't help me and suggested I call their customer service number and speak with a supervisor! Here I am in a customer service center being told to call customer service! I called and requested to speak with a supervisor, but the rep outright refused! She stated the first thing that needed to be done was a box research. She completed the forms and told me I'd be contacted within 14 business days. I know that the box is sitting in some warehouse and hasn't been scanned yet! My best friend works for Comcast and he just so happens to scan returned equipment in their warehouses! I informed him of the situation and even provided him with the delivery date, time, and the person who signed for it. He knows the person that signed for the package and stated he would handle it. A week later, he called me and told me everything was taken care of. For some reason though, I wanted to be sure. So I called Comcast 7/7/09 and the rep told me that there was still a balance and I was sill in collections! I demanded a supervisor, but the rep told me to speak with the collections department. I called collections and they wanted to do another box research. I refused to be put off and wait another 2 weeks with no results. I again requested a supervisor, who noticed that a box research was put in on 6/6/09 but nothing had been done about it. He suggested I go to a customer service center and I informed him that I did and was turned away! He took down all of the information that I had to provide and promised to follow up with me. Hopefully, something gets done soon because this is affecting my credit. This is not fair!
__label__0 I had the triple play service; phone, internet, and TV. I had trouble from day one when I paid $90 to have service connected. Two televisions did not even have the wire needed to hook to the cable. Three outlets were either missing or not screwed in. The cable was laying on the ground in front of my house. To this day I have a cable with two splitters running across my front porch. Comcast told me to be careful that it wasn't kicked. I had to contact Comcast seven times in under one year because service went out. I was told by a supervisor that they would refund the days I was unable to use the phone and other services. She also told me they would fix the installation. None of this ever happened. In fact, because it was a holiday weekend, my daughter who had just gotten home with a newborn baby the day before was home alone with no phone or transportation.This supervisor had been informed of this but insisted I would have to wait several days to get the phone working. I have now canceled the phone service. The next problem I have will go to the authorities of my city as I have documented it all. I have had cable with several companies of many years with no problems. Comcast has the worst installation, equipment and by far the worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with.
__label__1 They never came to fix the problem and never came to give me another equipment.I have been waiting for them to return the billing charges that has been taken even though their equipment and the wall keypad never functioned. They also have been charging me in the past for SPORTs channels and other stuff that I had never ordered and I always wondered why their bill is always in the above 180 range, and now they were supposed to give me basic cable, they moved my services for fifty bucks, and again charged my 79.99 as if I was a new customer. When I called them to inquire they gave me some reason, that I don't understand at all, plus they removed all the HD channels from my package and still billing me 79.99 for a month. If it was autopay it will be ten dollars off they said. Let's see what happens this month. I am watching them!Updated 10/17/2016 - The first review I have provided here on Consumer Affairs, about my alarm system malfunction. The person I spoke to said (B+B) Mr. ** mentioned the alarm system does not show had any problems so they cannot refund the amount they have charged me for the past 7 months.
__label__1 I would like to file a complaint regarding Comcast. I have had services with them since September 2014 (internet, home security and cable). I will not get into the multitude of problems I have encountered over the past year. I have been attempting to contact Comcast to disconnect all of my services as I am being relocated overseas by my employer. The first time I called (5/30) I was told that they were having computer issues with individuals who had my kind of account, and that I would have to call back to disconnect services. I have attempted to contact them again today. I was transferred three separate times and asked to repeat all of my identifying information. Apparently, I kept getting transferred to the wrong person. On the third transfer, I spoke with someone who said that I would still have to pay $500 to cancel my services because of a two year contract. I explained that I was not moving somewhere in the US, where I would have an option to continue my services with Comcast and maintain my contract. I do not have a choice in the matter and am moving to a place where they do not provide services. Comcast is adamant that this fee is still owed, when no other service provider is claiming this. Virtually every other company has stated that since I am moving to a location where they do not offer services, the cancellation fee is voided. I asked to speak to a manager ** who placed me on hold repeatedly. She came back with the same response. I requested to speak with one of her superiors. I have now been on hold for 63 minutes and no one has come on the line. I am not sure if they are finding a supervisor, if they are giving me the run-around, or are waiting for me to give up and end the call.I am extremely frustrated. I would like my services disconnected with no early termination fee since I do not have the option to continue my contract. They are providing sub-standard customer service all around and at this point, I would never return to Comcast for any kind of service if/when I return to the US due to the way I have been treated by them. It is clear that they do not value or respect their customers.
__label__1 I have never dealt with such a company. Their customer service is by far the worst I have ever experienced anywhere. My mother lost all of her services on December 30th - phone internet and cable. Comcast did not feel that it was an emergency to come out and fix any of these services until 1/4, leaving my elderly mother with no phone service for 5 nights. She has no cell phone either for an emergency. I have Comcast myself and am going to be looking for new providers for both of us. My brother and I both tried calling several times to have an emergency visit but Comcast said no. Her bills are paid on time and she now has to sit without service due to their equipment failure. I have shared this story with coworkers and neighbors to make sure Comcast will lose many customers as a result.
__label__1 I spoke with a young girl name Marry for a package deal. She was very pushy and she was annoying. I could barely understand her. She sounded like a 3-year old child. When I tell her I will have to call her back and hang up she has her boss call me!!! Her boss by the name Nick is even more pushy than her. He refused. I "had to speak with his employer again." I then told him "I am not getting the package at this time. I will have to call you back." These people are demanding. They are rude and they have no respect! I been a loyal customer to Comcast for years! But they keep getting worse and worse as time goes on. The guy who hooks up the cable broke my TV and were they loyal to their customer after that? No, absolutely not. If I continue to get treated the way I have by Comcast! They can thank Dish Network for stealing another customer!!! What a joke.
__label__1 On Sunday, January 8, 2012, I spent about 3 hours on the phone trying to resolve a problem regarding our email - i.e. emails sent by one individual are sent back with an error message. Each time I called, the call would go to an outsourced country (Philippines, I believe) and three times I was given the runaround. On the fourth call, I was told by an individual that the call had come to a "fee-based area" of Comcast and that I had to pay upfront $49.00! I was shocked by this method of Comcast to collect money for a problem that has originated from Comcast. I vehemently declined to pay a cent. I tried another call, this time asked for the supervisor and the rep said the "manager has gone home". I told him call centers don't run without a supervisor. Well, I tried again (6th call) and this time, I asked again for a manager. I was told that the supervisor was on the phone, but he said the supervisor would call me back and asked for my USA number. From past experience, I told him that people in the foreign-located offices never call USA customers to settle a problem. He lied as I have so far not received a call. I am sure if I had spoken to a rep in the USA, this problem would have been resolved. I am frustrated and fed up with Comcast customer service. Who should I contact now?
__label__1 I phoned Comcast business to inform them that their services were no longer needed. Representative said he would fax me a form and all I had to do to cancel and disconnect my services was to sign and return, so I did on October 31, 2013. On November 4th, I drove to local Comcast office and returned all of my rented equipment and was told I would receive a final bill within a week. I received my final bill on December 2, 2013 stating that I owed them another $193.00 for month of November. Remember, services were disconnected Oct. 31st. I called and was told I was suppose to call another department and tell them to disconnect me. I could swear we live in computer age now and one computer talks to the other, obviously not within Comcast customer service. I have spent 1hour and 33 min on hold today trying to talk with customer service and finally when I came off hold, the recorded msg says, "I'm sorry but the business dept of Comcast is currently closed. Our hours are 9-5." The problem in my eyes is Comcast doesn't give a damn about customers who disconnect services. There is no Customer Service within Comcast!!! Just a Recording!!
__label__0 Well where to start, I have had many problems over the past couple years more recent the past year. I have continually had problems with my boxes working and with on demand. I eventually gave up for a while due to the fact that I could not tolerate being treated so poorly and not getting the service that I am expected to pay for. Most recently on Saturday May 15, 2010 I went to a Comcast office because my HD box was not working getting on demand and one of my other boxes just stopped working completely a few days prior. So I get to the Comcast office and there is a door to slide the boxes in (thick glass) and the 1st thing that happened was the lady yelled at me for putting them in the wrong way? I mean like I was a child, the customer next to me felt the need to get involved and said maybe you should have a sign on how to put them in if there is a certain way to do so.Then when I told her I only need to exchange them for not working, she proceeded to tell me that the number on my HD box did not match up. I told her that is the only one we had and about 7 months (or so) ago one of the cable guys tried to exchange it that was the only time it would have been switched to fix the problem. She said well he shouldnt have done that and that now I would have to pay an extra $9.95 per month for the extra box. I proceeded to tell her that it is not an extra box, we only had the one HD box and I did not want to pay $9.95 for a box that one of the employees made a mistake on. She said until that other one is turned in I would have to do exactly that. She refused to try and help in any way just belittling me. I told her to give me the box because we needed it and that I would call the 800 number. She said they wont do anything ( as she was mumbling things about hating dealing with this) She finally gave me the box (charging me of course)and then asked me if I had the slip from 6-8 months ago from when he came out to my house .. I told her that I wouldnt have saved something from that long ago -- she proceeded to tell me she saves everything for 7 years, I told her she is a better person than me then! She said I didnt mean that then; she was just so nasty to me. So I left and called the 800 number and spoke to a gentleman who was very nice, he took care of the box and corrected the numbers on my account for me and then we found out that another problem with my account was as follows: When everything switched to digital we were sent a notice that said we needed a box for every TV. I called the 800 number and they told me that I could get 2 boxes at no charge for 1 year. Then normal charges would apply. Come to find out they have been charging me $8.90 per month for every box since July. I told him why I would go from paying nothing extra for the TVs which are in bedrooms to $8.90 per month each. He said it looks like they shipped out the wrong boxes; he could only go back and give me a credit for 2 months (about $36.00) but that is not fair to me. I am not an employee and how I am supposed to know they sent the wrong boxes. I mean they were mailed and I have to assume that they were correct. I have to be honest I never review the bill in detail because I dont really understand it. To make the matter worse when I got home and hooked up the boxes the HD box did not work and now I have to go again and return it. I work almost 60 hours a week and when I m home I have family obligations of taking kids to sporting events and other things. I was told by the lady in the Comcast office that it must not be that important of I cant arrange my schedule to have someone come out to the house? Many in todays day and age she has the time, but I am never nor can I be home for 4 hours at a time to wait for the cable company to come out. She said what about Sundays --- I told her no not then either. I mean she is now questioning my schedule. Bottom line ~ I want my bill and cable fixed!
__label__1 Well, they really have zero workers who have brains. The repair time for their mistakes is always a week out or more. They sent over a Comcast worker who was giving my neighbor cable. So they just disconnect my service and gave him my service because they did not want to do the work! Then drove into our manicured lawn and got stuck. To the point I had to call a tow truck! DO NOT GET COMCAST!
__label__1 No doubt the WORST TV/INTERNET/PHONE service EVER. Do not subscribe with them. They charge more than they tell you, don't show up for appointments, customer service hangs up on you. When I first signed on with them, I had 2 land lines to work from home. For 5 months my fax line would not work: 3 service calls, new fax machine and still nothing. When we finally found out Comcast didn't port the number from AT&T. They offered nothing,and was charged $350 install fee! They have zero customer service and don't care about customers. Even service men tell us it's awful. DO NOT USE Comcast. You'll be sorry. I promise you.
__label__0 I have been a cable user with Adelphia since 2002, the company that was taken over by Comcast.I called to ask to add an HD receiver and the rep told me that would cancel my entire contractual arrangement with Comcast for all services written with Adelphia which they had agreed to honor.Comcast would now up my rates (Currently over $100 per month for all cable TV services +  Internet service) and also change my current Internet contracted rate of $25.22 per month I obtained by buying all Adelphia television services.They were to honor those contracts I believe.A cable box is $6.95 per month, why not just provide that added charge? By adding anything to the service it gives them the excuse to force completely new pricing across the entire contract. It seems the company doesn't care about the customer - only to get as much as they can from the customer. I would by happy to pay for the HD box.They want to charge $49.95 vs. $25.22 for Internet because I want to ADD an HD box?I think these people are arrogant, need more competition and better management.   The consequences are I will review  other service options with a good chance I will change my business with Comcast.It takes one customer at a time to erode a business.
__label__1 My Comcast internet service is constantly cut or so slow it is impossible for me to load web pages. This does not allow me to accomplish any work that needs to be done at home, do any online gaming and forces me to work late nights at the office. Sometimes the service is as bad as not getting a signal at all. Whenever I call to ask about what could be wrong, they constantly try to blame the problem on my router or modem, both of which I replaced already the first time they told me to, or put me on hold for an unreasonably long amount of time. Then, when I called a technician to come over, he claims there is no problem and promptly goes to charge me $40 for coming over. Then when he leaves, I try to resume work and the internet connection gets cut again.
__label__0 I have contacted Comcast several times about a safety issue concerning the cable wire left on the side walk and in the grass area. The children are tripping over the wire and the splitters were left open. All we want is for the wire to be buried. My grandchild fell and hit his head on the step, others have hurt themselves also.
__label__1 I decided to switch to Comcast for my TV service about 6 months ago. In doing so I asked about Senior discount because I am 66 years old, I was told that they do not have it here in Philadelphia, but they do in Jersey...does that seem fair? What do you think? How can we get a discount for seniors here in Philadelphia? Thanks.
__label__0 Getting my emails to show are extremely slow, not to mention weather on there is not my local weather, closest was Hershey. I still can't access my account info for Comcast view bill.
__label__5 Comcast installed my service on DIRECTV's wiring, resulting in poor service. A tech came out and decided we definitely needed the correct wiring and I would not be charged since Comcast failed to wire my home from the start. I received a bill for $500 for wiring. For 4 months I spoke to 13 people, including a visit to the local Comcast office. All customer service reps and billing dept reps assured me on every call that the bill would be fixed while my service was constantly be suspended. Yes, they never fixed the bill or refrained from suspending my service every few days so now I'm done with them. I'm a new, happy customer of AT&T, with great service and customer service. Comcast has the worst customer service I've ever experienced.
__label__1 Total Lies and Deceit with their Agents Representations: I had huge problems with service throughout 2014 - and finally, Comcast offered a discount in my monthly payment to make up for technicians not showing up and most importantly, poor quality service. That said, in Jan/Feb 2015 I called Comcast to see if I could lock in my rate for 2 yrs. After speaking to three different agents over a period of four days, I finally agreed to another package that would lock in my rate for $150-$155 per month (First Lie). I deployed in late Feb as a contractor to AFG and after reviewing my bill in Apr 15, allowing for the prorated period to end, I noticed that my billing had now increased to $188.00! Obviously, I was tempted to cancel everything, however, in wanting to take care of my wife while deployed, I decided to keep all and contact Comcast again to figure out a solution.After speaking to two Agents and two days of phone calls, I was told that my package was the best they could do (Second Lie), though I was offered a slight discount that would now bring my bill to $170.00 per month. After agreeing to all and contemplating the deal over the few days, I finally called Comcast again to speak to a Supervisor. Well, I ended up speaking to a Great Agent overseas who told me that I could have been locked in with my old package for 2 yrs, and he would take care of everything. He did, and my new bill should be around $125.00 per month.After that call, I contacted Comcast again, this time, writing into Tom K's office - What a Joke!!! My intent was to see if I could be reimbursed the difference, based on the lies, and now knowing I could have kept my original package. As all of you know, Mr. Tom K. never reads our complaints and sure enough, I received another CS Agent after complaining about my experience, and then wanting to compliment the young man who finally took care with me. Standard verbiage and apologies, without any resolve. They told me they would contact me again and see if they could help. Nothing! I replied again to their CS email and now receiving another CS Agent - Office to Tom K - told me that my case would have to escalated! Still waiting... Upon my return home, I am cutting the Cable!!! Stay away from Comcast. Really, truly the worst CS Ever!
__label__1 I split time between two homes in CO and FL. I have Comcast in CO and decided that I would get it in Cape Coral. When they came out to install, there was no information left regarding channels or any account information. The installer said Comcast would mail this to me. The first day, the cable and internet went out 3 times; the first being for an hour and the second time for a few minutes. The third time, it was out at least until one in the morning when I finally gave up and went to sleep. I called Comcast that night complaining and they told me that it would be up and running soon. The next day, my services (internet and cable) did return. That night, they stopped again but only for about 5 minutes. It was still irritating. That week my service was in and out. I had a supervisor contact me saying I would not be charged for that time period it was out. This kept happening and I was even told at one point that the cable was not out. I was told it was my equipment but my neighbor had Comcast also and confirmed hers was also out. The beginning of the second week, I called to cancel because I could not take anymore. I was given a location to bring back my equipment. I got to the location and it was no longer there. I called on my cell phone and they gave me another location. It was not there either. The third time, I was very upset; I was wasting gas on a provider whose service was crap. I finally got hold of a different rep and they sent me to a location that was actually open. I made sure I received a receipt for my equipment. I made sure I talked to a rep and go names. I was told since I cancelled within 30 days, I would not be charged and that because of the headache, I would not have to pay for installation. I got another bill. I called and the rep said it does not look like my account got closed out properly and that she would do this now. She said she was unable to put into the computer the actual day I did call (even though I have my receipt returning my equipment) but since I was still within 30 days that I was still not going to be charged. Once again, I got a bill. I called and was very pissed by now. The rep said it was taken care of and she saw the notes in the computer and to ignore the billing. Guess what happened? I got a letter from a debt agency telling I owe a debt and it will be reported on my credit report.I am beyond upset by now but I paid it because I have A credit and was worried. I call Comcast again. They tole me I would hear back by the proper department regarding this within 1 to 6 business days. I have yet for anyone to call me back. I contacted Rick ** via his page that guarantees you will be satisfied. No word except a email saying we have received your letter and someone will contact you shortly. That was weeks ago. It is upsetting that this company who I still pay for service in Colorado is a fraud. They do not guarantee anything and they hide from their customers. I am one of those people who do not like a big government involvement in companies but when you have companies like this taking advantage of companies, it really makes me change my mind. I hope that some action is done to stop this company from preying on others. I have watched my fees here in CO go up and I would have to pay to get out of my service. As soon as my contract is done, I am done with this provider. The fact that they can wreck someone's credit makes me ill.
__label__1 I have been a customer of Comcast Cable Service/Xfinity for 20+ years. I signed up for their X-1 service late last February 2014. It has been a disaster. I lose connection on the satellite boxes regularly and it can take several hours or on the most recent issue - days to reset the box and receive service again. (I still do not have service on one of the satellite boxes and it has been 5 days.) The service freezes, I lose connection with the main box. Some of the issues are so ridiculous that they are comical. I have had technicians out to my house on average once to twice per month. I spend hours on the phone trying to have service restored - approximately every other week. We cross our fingers when we turn on our televisions - hoping we will have service. I requested a credit and was given one $60.00 which I happily accepted but informed them that it was woefully inadequate and I expected something much larger or I was leaving for Verizon Fios. They said they would look into it but did not seem to really care.
__label__0 Starting in the beginning of May 2008 my husband and I got divorced. We moved into a new house and the first thing we did was call comcast. They came out the first week of May and installed our tv and internet services. The gentleman was very nice and said we just needed to contact customer service to have the three email accounts on my ex husbands transferred over to our new account. Easy enough- that's what I thought. I contacted customer service right away and the Rep put in a ticket to have this completed. I called back a few days later to check and make sure it was completed and was told the ticket had been closed and the tech did not see any problems with us accessing our emails and they were working fine. I advised them that this was not the issue the ticket should have been opened for and that we we're just trying to transfer over our emails- we were not having any problem accessing them at all. The rep then put in a new ticket and told me it would now be entered correctly and completed within 48 hours. At this time customer service also contacted my ex husband to make sure his permission was granted for this to take place. On May 12th I called back to see what the status of the claim was. I was given some tired excuse and told that they would make it a priority so that it would be complete within 24 hours. I told them I would like a call back when this was completed to avoid any further time of mine wasted calling back in. On May 17th I still had not heard anything regarding the ticket and transfer of our email accounts and once again phoned comcast. This time I was told it was still pening and someone would be calling me on Monday. I never did receive this call and had to phone back in again on May 25th. This time I spoke with a Supervisor named Veronica/Ronnie. She looked into the issue a bit further and said the reason this was taking so long and still pending was because comcast had not received permission from my ex husband (which they already had at the beginning of the month). Rather than spend anymore time on the phone I said I would call him and have him call in to give his permission again. Ronnie said as soon as they spoke with him the issue would be taken care of within a few hours. My ex husband called and gave his permission. Later that day I still did not hear anything from Ronnie and called back. I was told she had left for the day and as far as this supervisor new it would take 24-48 hours to be completed now.I waited another week. On June 1st I had still not heard anything and called back. This time I spoke with a supervisor named James. After going over the problem for what seemed to be the thousandth time he said the reason nothing was being completed on this ticket now was because last weekend when they finally spoke with and got permission from my ex husband that the rep simply forgot to resubmit the ticket! He resubmitted the ticket and assured me this time that it had all the correct information, everyone's approval, and that it would be complete in 24-72 hours. He also reassured me and noted on the account again for whomever that completes this calls me to let me know it has been complete. Now here I am, it is June 8th. I still had not received a phone call and once again had to take time out of my day to call comcast. Today I spoke with a Sup named Greg. He advised me that this ticket is still waiting to be assigned for a tier 2 rep to complete. I told him that I thought it was an eslcated/emergeny flagged ticket and was to be completed immediately according to the past Supervisors. He confirmed this but could not give me any reason to why it has been 8 days and still it has not been assigned nor completed. He could not give me any time frame as to how long it will take for someone to get assigned to this or how much longer my ticket will have to be out in limbo. It doesn't seem to me that in any customer service enviorment that an eslcated issue should take 8 days or more to get resolved. I wouldn't have minded waiting the 8 days in the beginning, but considering we have already been dealing with this for the past month it seems a little rediculus that this cannot be made a priority. Everyone at comcast seems very good about putting the blame on the person who handled the situation before them and giving excuses, but no one seems able to do anything to fix the situation. I contacted customer service right away and the Rep put in a ticket to have this completed. I called back a few days later to check and make sure it was completed and was told the ticket had been closed and the tech did not see any problems with us accessing our emails and they were working fine.

__label__0 I have been trying unsuccessfully to get Comcast service where I live. I have been told that there was a block put on this address and that is why I cannot receive cable service. My son is the one who has an outstanding bill with Comcast (he even has Comcast cable at this new address and if it is not in his name, then it is being done illegally by using another person's name). I have talked to several customer associates at Comcast to resolve this matter and get this block removed from my address so that I can get Comcast for myself under my name (I did have Comcast myself in the past and did pay my bills). Please, can someone help me? I just want to receive Comcast service and I do not feel that it is right to penalize me for the actions of anyone else even if that person happens to be my son! It is just not right. I do pay my bills so why should I be penalized?I have done all that I can do. I have given your people at Comcast Henry's current address so that you can pursue collection of the debt that he owes you. I have even given you information that you can use to check and see for yourself that he is getting Comcast cable at his current address where only he and his wife live, so he must be getting it under another person's name illegally. Thank you very much.
__label__0 I am writing this after Comcast put me through 48 hours of hell but it really started over a year ago. I am an avid football fan so I decided after over 15 years of basic cable with Comcast to get a DVR. I researched the DVR and found that it was limited in recording size by 160 gig HD. There was no option to upgrade it internally or externally. Comcast had also made sure the customer could not offload any recordings to a computer or get a different DVR. Everything was no, no, no. I decided to live with it expecting Comcast to eventually allow customers to upgrade.About two weeks ago, with football season approaching, I decided to revisit the DVR situation. I was surprised that it was identical to last year. Comcast has disabled or blocked every possible way to get more recording space. My DVR can record only 20 hours of HD. One HD football game lasts for 4 hours. I could almost fill this DVR up in one weekend of football. This was when a coworker mentioned I should get TiVo. The more research I did, the more I found the answers where yes, yes, yes.The TiVo was highly upgradeable in every way. There was one problem. There is a multitude of horror stories on websites such as comcastmustdie.com and others of Comcast customers who have attempted and failed to get Comcast to do one simple thing (install Comcast cable card in the TiVo box). After researching the situation and considering that I hold a Masters Degree in Information Systems from Kennesaw State University, I figured I could walk a Comcast CSR through the process.I knew from my research that I would be better off to go to Comcast and get the m-card because every part of this process could be done over the phone. It's a simple matter of typing some numbers in a computer (m-card pairing) and sending an initialization hit from the Vinings head end. I also knew that many of the service reps sent out have no idea what they are doing. I won't even go into the trouble I went through to actually get the m-card from Comcast.When my TiVo arrived, I followed the instructions and made sure that the latest software was installed. On Monday night, July 27th, I was ready to make my first of about ten calls to Comcast customer service. The CSR was named Pat. I knew from the online forums what numbers she needed such as host ID and data ID. She said she didn't need all those numbers - that everything would start working in about 45 minutes. Nothing happened so I went to bed and started the next morning.I didn't get the names of every CSR I talked to but I know it was at least 8, and maybe 10. The fact that the first one I talked to didn't set up a case file proves that their entire existence is a joke to Comcast. With a case file, the eighth CSR I talk to will know this. Asking them a question is equal to asking the guy that bags my groceries what to do about my cable TV. Sometime on Tuesday afternoon, one of the CSRs mentioned that she could schedule a field rep to install my cable card the next day. I was exhausted so I reluctantly agreed knowing I may be paying $17 for more misery.Lamont arrived at 12 noon today in a Comcast truck. I started bombarding him with technical information about Val:V missing and the Auth:MP problem. He didn't know what I was talking about but he assured me he would get my cable card working. I took some notes. He called someone at ** using my phone because his was malfunctioning. He told them he was getting an illogical equipment message from the first person (the dispatcher) he called that could not help him. He said it was job number **. He switched the m-card I had received from Comcast with another one. He also solved one mystery.From the second I received the m-card, I was billed for digital service a/o. He said the Comcast rep had charged me for an additional stb instead. These charges were on the bill that I received on Tuesday. I was able to check the conditional access screen (which he knew nothing about) and see that the Val:? had changed to Val:V but Auth:MP still displayed which needs to be Auth:S. He said I was 36th in line to receive an init hit from the Vinings head end. He said I should have all my channels within an hour and he would call back to verify.He assured me that if the init hit failed, he would return to fix it. Indeed, some unencrypted HD channels displayed as he was leaving. I commended him and told him I would keep checking channels until he called. He gave me a receipt and took my Comcast DVR and the original m-card I had received from Comcast. That was about 5 hours ago and no call. Below, I have provided every piece of information Comcast may need to correct these problems. I believe it would take a person with basic knowledge of how to use a computer and telephone about 5 to 10 minutes to fix this problem.The grief this has caused me has made a permanent negative impression on me concerning Comcast. What is the price to pay for that? Right now, my options are limited. I have invested in a TiVo DVR, a year of TiVo service, and football season is coming up. My personal knowledge of technology ensures me that a time will come in the near future that I can rid myself of this Comcast. Consider this: I intended to eventually have Comcast cable, Comcast Internet service and Comcast phone service. Now, I intend to eventually rid my house of all traces of Comcast.In the meantime, this is what must happen in the next 24 hours. I want every single channel that I am paying for restored and an email or phone call from Comcast assuring me that I have been refunded for the erroneous charges and that I am not charged one single minute for the DVR and m-card Lamont took with him. I also will not be charged for Lamont accomplishing nothing. Make sure the $17 is removed. Considering what I have been through, I should receive a month's credit but I can assure you at this point with the time and money this has cost me that would be an insult. You will however give me what's mine. I will not waste my time on the phone with another Comcast CSR and I would prefer that no one else from Comcast be sent to my house.In the event that all of this does not take place at 5:00 pm eastern on Thursday, July 30th, 2009, I will draft a cover letter and place that and this entire email in letters to the president and CEO of Comcast and every member of the board of directors of Comcast, the FCC, the governor's office of Consumer Affairs and the BBB. I also intend to post this email on comcastmustdie.com and any other websites or forum that will allow me. Next week, I plan to start requesting meetings with the President, CEO and members of Comcast board of directors. These people need to hear in person what Comcast is doing to its customers.
__label__1 I called the account rep for Digital Starter+Internet for $89.99 offer that I got in the mail. He said that doesn't exist but he can offer me Digital Preferred + Internet (Blast) for $99.99 + $10 for HD box locked for 12 months and no contract and ship the equipment. So here are all the things that went wrong:He didn't tell me that there is $15 self install kit fee. They start adding $10 additional fee for Blast internet. When I called and said I would like to cancel my account, their escalation department told me that there will be a termination fee because I am on a contract. I have NOT accepted any contract either on the phone or through email. When I talked to the manager in the escalation department, he said I have a different package and I did not sign a contract. So they basically don't know what they are talking about and are not connected to each other.
__label__1 A CUSTOMER FROM 2010: Connecticut. I was recently sent a letter on October 25th, which I received on Oct. 27th stating that I owed Comcast 20.00 for using a DVR box that I was not paying for. I thought WTF? I do not have a DVR box at all. This had been confirmed on other occasions as I had to call Comcast to complain of tiling on my TV screen. To boot, they sent me my monthly invoice dated 25, received also on Oct. 27th s with a $20.00 fee attached!On October 30th, I called the beloved customer service and after you have to deal with all the button pushing, the MAN on the other end said to read the model number- it was an RNG 100 a box that DOES NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO BE A DVR and HE, politely as pie, he says, nope, Im sorry that is a DVR box. I said this is the 2nd time you have harassed me about having something I dont." Scruples? Comcast or Xfinity have none. I was pissed and said  Hey get one of your techys out here and we will see." Sure enough, I had the best technician come out. He took one look and said THATS NOT A DVR BOX AT ALL." I said "Thank you, I knew that but some idiot that I called the day before and made me read the serial numbers to, said different." What a piece of work Comcast is.I told my very informative, very well trained techy, he should be a manager with the way things are going with this Conglomerate called Comcast/Xfinity. I then told him with poor communications with my phone - I have a bundle deal with phone, internet and TV - and he said "thats not right" and I explained that I also get bumped off watching a streaming video - on the Xfinity site, which I PAY FOR! He investigated where the cables were hooked up and I mentioned that a previous tech said because I am on the end of the line sometimes the signal was not as strong (meaning I am at the last portion of where the wires go to my home). I lose signal strength big time. He said, "why didnt they put an amplifier in?" I was FLOORED!!! I recently had someone come out due to the tiling issue with my TV and he said all was OK with the house - which was correct - and the issue was at the POLE.So at that time, why didnt this technician install an Amplifier to increase my signal strength??? I've been paying for lousy, service for months!!! My favorite techy was dismayed as well. He said, "thats the problem" and installed the amplifier to increase the strength of my signal. But all along I had been paying for something I did not have. Conglomerate. So, besides having a mishandling of my account @ Xfinity/Comcast & accusing me of having something I never, ever had, plus the fact that I should have had an amplifier installed months ago, plus the fact that my phone calls out of country were so lagging in conversation to the other party, it was utterly annoying plus the fact that Comcast charged me for something I never ever had, plus, OMG they OWE ME!!!Where do they get off and when do customers start to matter? 400 million phone and interactions with people who are pissed off - my lord, Get it together or get the hell out! I plan to gain a much overdue credit with this Conglomerate. They will pay for the distrust they have put on this particular customer. They did not trust me- why in the heck should I trust them.
__label__1 Comcast for some reason, to my surprise, has been billing me twice every month. I pay my bill on time each month online and it is withdrawn. Recently when I married, we started using my husband's bank account and I noticed that my bank account overdrew... What? Why? Oh because Comcast withdrew from my account as well.So I started investigating this and I start to realize each month, every single month for over 8 months, Comcast has been clearing my online "web" payment and also taking out a ppd amount (ppd meaning prearranged payment and deposit) which I have never set up automatic payment with Comcast, not ever! So why is this happening?!?! I wrote to "Tom" and am sending snail mail to corporate because someone must be held accountable for double billing me for over 8 months. I am a hardworking person who pays their bill each month and on time!
__label__1 My cable and Internet went out at the same time. At first I thought it was an outage but found out later that they said it was a bad connection at my end. Mind you I've had cable and TV here for a good while now and the service was ok at best I was able to play my games and watch television with no problems till tonight when everything just shut off and I am still waiting for it to come back on. I was told that I have to wait 3 days for someone to come out and fix their **. Yes I'm pissed.
__label__1 I have a summer residence and have tried calling Comcast on five different occasions to change my service to a basic package while no one is using the home. I have an Escalation Request Ticket # and still no satisfaction. Tried calling five times today and was disconnected each time.
__label__0 The comcast claims to provide a very high speed internet service. I have purchased their 12Mbs internet service package. I have also purchased their triple play service which is the most expensive service. I am their high paying customer. I don't mind paying high monthly fees as long as I get quality of service.  Lately comcast internet speed is very slow. I tried to call the customer service and they didn't help at all. I kept on calling multiple times and problem hasn't been resolved.  They claim to provide highest internet speed. All their commercial focuses on speed.  I am getting 54kbs internet speed. I am paying for 12Mbs. Their customer support was unable to help. I plan to switch to other internet service provider. It is painful to switch service to other provider and waste of my time and money. I have to do this but wanted to file complain for comcast so other people dont' suffer.  
__label__5 Comcast is capable of providing decent service to their customers, but not without charging you an arm and a leg for it. Also, they keep raising their prices for nothing and we have to call them every month to dispute the charges, and it's like as if they want to give us the runaround. Why us??? If you ask me, my suggestion for Comcast is to let customers pick exactly what channels they want to have and charge us a reasonable price for it, along with internet and phone. I watch only comedy pretty much, but Comcast loves to throw a lot of channels in that we won't even watch. Who has time to watch all these channels anyways, unless they have nothing better to do with their time?
__label__1 Worst customer service I've ever come across. I see why you're recruiting people out of customer service jobs for your company. A few months back, I called to see what it would cost to add STARS onto my account. The representative on the phone told me that it would only increase my TOTAL bill another $3 a month. I thought this was a great deal, and asked SEVERAL times, "How much my total cost would be?" Each time I was told it would only increase my total bill $3. When I finally look at the bill two months later, it's gone up over $25. So I called customer service and spent an hour on the phone. After getting nowhere, except a non-working phone number to a supervisor, I called back for a 4th time. This time I spoke with the first level customer service agent, who told me she could adjust my bill to the amount I was quoted. Now when I am getting ready to go to bed, I go upstairs and my cable box says "not authorized for use" so I had to call again and spend more time on the phone. I was given a reference number in case I had any problems. I have them the reference number and they told me that they had taken the $9.95 charge for the extra box off my account. And I had to pay for it to be turned back in. Another 20 minutes on the phone I spoke with someone whom I gave the reference number to and they kept telling be about my plan. Nothing about the price adjustment I was promised and supposed to clear up with my reference number. So they turned my box back on and gave me a credit of $10 for 12 months. Now, if I have the service longer than 12 months, I'm screwed. And as I type this, my box isn't even working. This is the worst service I've experienced. Ever. As soon as I can I will be trying to look for another option. All I've been given is lies and the runaround. Your company told me one thing, and did another, THREE TIMES. How can you stay in business when your employees are committing fraud by putting me into packages that I never agreed to, then telling me my bill would only go up $3 when it was close to ten times that amount?My reference number is **. Spent over two hours on the phone to get what I was quoted by your company, and even after they tried to fix it, they still screwed me. And I had to spend more time to fix your problems. I was recruited by a headhunter to work for your company because I specialize in customer service. In many industries. And I can tell you that if you were a retail store, and people had the choice to drive further to reach another store, you would be out of business. But since your the only option for some people, you seem to think that treating them fair and honest doesn't matter. If I was managing a small part of your customer service, I could turn it around in a week. Easy, be honest. Don't argue with customers who have a legitimate complaint and tell them about the plan they have. Listen to them, and fix their problems. Now, I'm guessing I'll be forced to call every month to get my bill fixed because no one there seems to know how to do anything or explain what they did. I was told that $20 was taken off my bill, but they didn't tell me that they took off the charge for my extra box and that it wouldn't be working. Or that if need to spend a half hour to get less than what they told me just so my box could be turned on. I will be posting this on every website I can to warn potential customers about how your company works and treats its customers. Something needs to be fixed. Fast.
__label__5 Most trouble calls are from non-technical people following a script card. The end of the call is always followed up with a sales pitch. Internet speed is slow during the evenings. Selection of programming for the package I have is terrible. But I'm all set with spending any more than I have to. Every 6 months the price goes up $3-5 for the same terrible service. At least 1 local outage per month. Cable certainly isn't what it once was. Give me MediaOne or AT&T Broadband of yesteryear. Comcast is the worst.
__label__0 I signed up for high speed internet. It is supposed to be 12mbps down and 4mbps up. I'm not seeing those numbers on a consistent basis. In fact, when I am downloading a file from the internet or email, everyone else in my house can download at no more than about 200kbs. It appears as though Comcast is throttling bandwidth when files are being downloaded. In addition, downloading speeds hover around 500kb/s most of the time, not even close to the advertised 12mbps. I feel that Comcast has misrepresented their product and I will probably demand my money back. This is very very disappointing. I am losing time and money, product not as advertised.
__label__1 On the 4th, we watched TV as normal, then left the house for a short time. When we came home in the late morning, 2 Comcast trucks were working on the box. In the house, no services were working. Eventually, everything came back on but one TV. So we called. They can't come and fix until Tuesday, and the trucks outside were doing "routine maintenance." I called again to see if we could get an emergency appointment. I was hung up on. So I called again. This rep told me he was escalating the incident and gave me an escalation number. He said I would receive a call within 2 hours and took my cell number. No call back came, but when I returned home, I had 4 missed calls on my home number from Comcast. I called again today. The rep said that I would not have received a call back and that those 4 calls were related to another matter, but she didn't know what it was. She told me my issue was probably with my TV and that they could not assist. Fed up, I asked to speak to a supervisor. After at least 30 minutes, the supervisor Jason from the escalation department came on. He said that they cannot get an appointment any earlier than Tuesday. Then he tried to go through the entire troubleshooting exercise that we had already gone through 4 times. He told me that I was being uncooperative because I wouldn't do it again and that he had nothing to offer me. I asked if I could speak to his boss, and he said there is no one above him available to speak to and that he is it. So here we are with no TV in the living room and 20 people coming over to watch the World Cup final tonight. I sent a message to the customer service center. I have no hope of getting this fixed in time, but I would like to have the terrible service addressed.
__label__1 On June 6, 2015 I called Comcast customer service for help with internet service. At the end of the call, the CSR who gave her name as **, gave me a sales pitch. ** told me I get increase my internet speed for only $7.00 per month, and it was a 30 day trial period during which time I could cancel at any time and not be charged. I asked ** at least five times if it was only $7.00 per month and that I could cancel at any time and not be charged. She said yes. I was also told I would not be charged the $7.00 until the end of the 30 day trial period. I said OK.On June 16, 2015 I went online to look at my Comcast internet data usage for the month, and found that my bill had increased by $17.00. I called Comcast customer service - billing - and spoke to **. ** told me part of my increased bill was due to Comcast price increases that go into effect on July 1, 2015. ** told me that $11.42 would be removed from my bill and that she has no idea why ** told me a $7.00 price. I told ** I wanted to go back to the exact service I had. ** assured me she would take care of it.On June 20, 2015 I went online and Comcast still had not corrected my bill. I called Comcast billing yet again, and spoke to **. ** said it was in the system to remove $11.42 from my bill, and ** assured me it would be taken care of. On June 30, 2015 my bill still has not been resolved. My bill has never been paid late. My bill is due tomorrow. How can any company be so incompetent? I really don't think they care. I am getting ready to switch to DIRECTV for TV, and AT&T for internet service.
__label__1 I signed up for Comcast Xfinity triple play about a year ago with an offer that said I would receive $200.00 in the form of a prepaid gift visa card and come to find out so did a lot of people. After about 6+ phone calls and several promises, and no return calls I still don't have my $200.00's. I still have a copy of that offer, and offered to fax it to them but was told that they had no way to receive a fax.
__label__0    I was one month late on my bill on 11/16/09 (160.00) for a billing cycle from 10/14 - 11/14, my services were interrupted. I contacted cable regarding the amount due, i was told one price and asked if I wanted to make my payment over the phone, I declined as I knew that someone would have to come to my home to reconnect.  I was transferred and then told that I needed to pay 330.00 because a new bill had gone out for services 11/14 - 12/14. I asked why do I have to pay for services not yet received especially since I was disconnected before the new bill came out.  I was told that is there policy and that the entire amount needed to be paid in cash (no debit/credit card) would be accepted. My services include cable, internet and phone thus I have no phone service at all.
__label__1 Comcast raises prices throughout your 2 year contract. Each month my bill has been more than the previous bill. It went from 198.00 to 295.00. When I called Comcast customer service to find out what was going on, she stated that all the promotion deals are rolling off due to it coming to a end of my contract. If this was a 2 year contract why are all the promotions rolling off monthly before the 2 years expired. Then she tells me my next month bill will be much more than 295.00. I will be canceling and finding a new provider. This company has been a headache for me for years. Really Bad Company.
__label__1 Approximately September 2013 I ordered Comcast business class Internet because I was having problems with the normal residential Internet. I was told all kinds of great things by Neil the Comcast sales guy. I signed up and they installed the service within a couple days and right away I had problems. The modem that they installed Locking up and it would take until the next day before a tech would arrive. They replaced the initial modem with another one of the same type and again by that night I had the same problem and could not access the Internet. The techs came and began to insist it was my fault. Even though they could not prove what I had done. They insisted I needed a network professional to run one cable from their modem to my computer.The problems continued for weeks to the point that I had to go into their office and create a scene. They insisted it was still my fault and then began a good old boy network of bashing me and putting me down including threatening and intimidating me by sending their biggest techs in twos and threes into my home and their techs tried to tell me to shut up in my home. I proved that it was the modem that was faulty and I proved it beyond a reasonable doubt and they still came back and said it was my fault. They decided to back each other up against me. I complained to corporate in Philadelphia and my complaints went nowhere. To this day none of my complaints have been answered.I have Post traumatic stress disorder, I am a registered disabled American, they violated my civil rights by abusing me and they were notified that I was disabled and that I had PTSD. I eventually insisted that they install SMC modem because it seemed to work much better, since that time which has been about two months I have had no problems. Since Comcast installed this SMC modem, I have done nothing to it at all. I haven't even restarted the computer it's hooked up to in two months' time nor have I restarted the server that runs on it. They still insist it was my fault and I need a network professional. I have more than proved this was their fault.Because of my disability, they caused me to have close to 2 to 3 months of anxiety attacks and panic attacks some of which cause me to stop moving. When I say stop moving, I mean the stress causes my muscles to tighten up so tight that I will not be able to move and I will fall on the floor if I'm standing kind of like those standing goats that fall over. It is very serious and very dangerous because this can kill me if I hit my head. I have also had nightmares almost every night because of this event. The level of my PTSD is that of a soldier who went through three tours of duty through Vietnam.At no time did they try and handle my disability appropriately nor did they look into my complaints to see if they were at fault. In addition, they have turned and lied and altered documents to make it look like they installed the SMC modem first and I have witnesses that saw them install the faulty modem. I even intercepted an email from their security department and their tech in which they were putting me down. I am not going to tolerate this if I have to be subject of a dictatorship in my country until at which point the dictators come to kill me I am going to make Comcast pay. They violated my civil rights as a disabled American with PTSD, they violated my rights as a protected consumer in the US of A, and they violated their own company policy and possibly criminal law by altering documents and lying and committing perjury and fraud.This is not an isolated example as Comcast has a history of treating customers abusively. Especially port disabled customers. In addition to this they threaten to terminate my service and they asked me numerous times to find another service because they did not want to fix the problem. All of my phone calls to Philadelphia corporate headquarters have been ignored. They in Philadelphia have returned the complaints back to hear in Spokane which then completes the circle of the good old boy network where nothing is getting done. I want something done immediately!
__label__0 Everyone was told when the digital conversion took place last year that we had to get rid of our old analog sets so we could view all but the pay channels. Now this year, Comcast comes back and says you will not be able to see anything but basic cable without one of their digital boxes. They gave us three but we have a large family and have to pay monthly for more. Just another fee for them to make money off of. Now we are paying for a service we can no longer watch on all our TVs throughout our home without paying Comcast's extortion money. More cost for cable TV. People in older homes having to load up receptacles to add on powered converters.
__label__0    About a week ago I experienced some sort of network error that could not be repaired through comcast tool. I went without the internet for a week, and personally I feel I shouldn't have to pay for those days since it stated it was a Comcast issue. I'm sure [they] have hears other complaints since I know of three other people this has happened to recently. My money, and time have been wasted due to [their] errors.
__label__1 Comcast sells 75 mbps service. My connection is, most of the time, under 0.9. Complains take 30 minutes. Improvement: none. Why are they allowed to stay in business?
__label__5 Comcast. They were to set-up services at my house on 11/8/14. They call me that day and they said they need to schedule for the next Saturday 11/15/14, I said ok. They come in on 11/15/14 and set-up the system. It work great until about 5:00 PM that day, then stop working so I call Comcast. I was on the phone with them on Saturday until 9:30 PM. They told me I would have my system up and running by Sunday morning. Sunday come and nothing. Got on the phone again. Finally, I had the system back up at 12:00 PM. I said ok. At 4:00 PM on Sunday, my system went down again so I call Comcast again. I was on the phone with them until 8:00 PM. They made an appointment for 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM for Monday. 12:30 on Monday, I call Comcast. Reason, nobody show up so they told me they would be over from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Again no one show up but my system started to work around 4:00 PM again. It only work until 7:00 PM so again I call Comcast. They told me someone would call me at 8:27 PM, still waiting. So today at 8:30 AM, I call Comcast again and I told them to cancel the contract. Lesson learn: Be careful when they offer you a shipper price. That is what you get, no services. That is why it's shipper.
__label__1 I had called a year ago or more asking about this charge and they told me it was for something else, not my internet modem/router, so I let it go. I went to the Comcast Office and they confirmed that it was not their modem which they could tell by the serial number showing in the system and have been billing me for 4 years. They entered a refund ticket for $376 of which the main office only credited back $24. This is a legal issue, it is fraud to bill someone monthly fees on something that is clearly showing in their records a serial number that isn't theirs. I need legal advice as soon as possible and will be going to BBB.
__label__1 I moved out of the Comcast area, so my alarm system could not move with me. Comcast demanded all payments for the term of the alarm system starting over from the last time I moved. The move was not planned. I had been paying for the alarm system monthly for 6 months, then moved inside their area. Paid another couple of months before moving out of the area. The demanded payment for the full term $1100. Did not even count the first 6 months payments. I called a couple of times they said I would need to call back. They turned me over to collections, which I have paid religiously, $59 twice a month. This shows on my credit report. I will never have any kind of service with Comcast again.
__label__1 I chose Comcast/Xfinity to be our DSL and alarm provider, but their actions were not professional from the beginning. We were given a few credits by their corporate office for several no shows, in which one caused us to miss the delivery of important information for our uncle's funeral. The installation person would say that he would be at our house at a certain time, but he did not show up or give a courtesy call. This would jeopardize our work schedule because most of the appointments were on a weekday.Comcast/Xfinity finally installed the equipment, but the billing credits had not been posted and the balance represented the wrong promotional rates. This caused the bill to be incorrect; it continued to be incorrect throughout the months of service. I have made many requests for them to produce a correct bill. Here is a list of problems that I have attempted to resolve with Comcast/Xfinity: This is the message that I receive as I access the Comcast.net portal to check and control things in my house, while out of town: "Page Error; your account has been suspended. Please contact your service provider to resolve the situation."My bill has been incorrect since February 2013. Although I have made every attempt to get a bill that shows the correct amount, I continue to see the wrong amount. Internet speed is supposed to have been the fastest, but it seemed sometime slower than my regular AT&T internet speed.Although I had my alarm checked more than once, I still experience the same problems. Four times this past month, I have come home and entered my code to disarm my home alarm. The alarm continues to beep after I have entered the code several times, until the siren finally sound off. Tanisha ** (Executive Customer Relations Houston Region) sent someone out to check this problem. He diagnosed the problem as the code being entered too fast. If I enter the code and one digit does not respond, I will not get another chance to re-enter the code and disarm the alarm. This will eventually lead to the alarm siren sounding. If my alarm constantly triggers, my neighbors will soon ignore it and that leaves opportunity for a real burglary to occur unnoticed. Another problem is the complaints of my alarm going off early in the morning and in our quiet neighborhood; it is disturbing my neighbors. I did not have this problem with my old alarm system!My email system no longer keeps track of when someone enters or leave my house.I could not monitor or control features in my house for weeks all because of reasons mentioned. I made several requests for Mrs. ** to give me the service that I paid for or cancel my contract. Without any attempt to resolve the problems and give adequate service, she immediately canceled my service the same day. I believe this decision was made to avoid giving the credits that were supposed to post to my billing account. I also believe that her decision was an attempt to avoid honoring the very low promotional rate that was offered in the beginning. When I spoke to her the same day that she disconnected my service, she told me that I would not receive a refund for the poor service received the entire time of service. She also made sure to inform me that by taking this matter up with corporate CEO (Brian Roberts), it will only trickle back down to her.I sent Mrs. ** a final email as an attempt to get her to correct the problems. I told her that I'd really rather have this situation resolved and allow them an opportunity to give better service. She told me that my service had already been cancelled and it would cost me installation fees again. She also informed me that the special promotional rates would not be available. This definitely demonstrates how unethical and unscrupulous Comcast/Xfinity is to their customer. To lure a customer in with promotions and not give the service that is expected, but cancel the customer's account instead of attempting to resolve the problems is just ludicrous and immoral.I am requesting that my full service be restored along with the same promotions that were tied to the account; I also need all issues and concerns resolved: I need my bill to reflect the proper amount online moving forward. I need the keypad that does not properly work replaced with one that does work. I need to be able to control and monitor my system online without error. I need your system to do everything that Comcast/Xfinity advertised it to do. I need my high speed internet to reach the speed advertised in the promotion.My house that was monitored under Central Security is unmonitored and can be broken in at any time. If service cannot be restored, I would like a full refund of any amount paid to Comcast/Xfinity!
__label__1 Balance on my account keep increasing! First, the reps are rude and unprofessional. You just never know what your balance will be after so much adjustment of services that were never authorized by you.
__label__1 I called their 800 number to cancel service and the lady would not let me. After she went on for 10 minutes on a lower plan and I told her I still could not afford it, she said I had agreed. B.S. I only agreed to listen to the plans. I am disabled and unemployed. SHAME ON YOU COMCAST!! I want out of Comcast!!
__label__1 I just recently agreed to upgrade to the new X1 system on August 6. In the call, which was recorded, I was not only given a date of Aug. 17 for installation but was given the option between two free installs - do it myself or have a Comcast technician come to my home and do it. I opted for the latter. I was also told on August 6 to expect a confirmation email with all the details.As of August 7, no email had arrived. I called Comcast and was very surprised to learn that not only was my installation date now August 28th without any notification, I was also informed that there would be a $39.95 callout charge for the installation. I did receive the email shortly thereafter this and found out that not only was there going to be a $39.95 charge but an additional $20 for a 1 Product Install. So in 36 hours, I went from a free install on August 17th to a $59.95 fee for installation on August 28th. Comcast agree to review the recorded call if they could find it and get back to me no later than Tuesday afternoon, August 11th. We'll see.
__label__0 For the past 4 months, I have had major problems with my phone; calls get forwarded to my son's or a business without me doing anything. There was also a period where calls where blocked, and then the phone did not work at all. Now after numerous visits by Comcast, the problem continues. Calls get forwarded to my son's house even though I have called Comcast many times. One of their technicians was here and I called and told them. The following 2 days, I had to call again, still no result. Some people are getting to the point they don't want to call me. Where do I turn to get this mess fixed? Comcast had gotten too big. They really don't care if your phone, etc., work or not, just pay them. Well, I'm fighting back and I need all the help I can get. I don't think it is too much to ask for your phone to work.
__label__1 According to 24/7 Wall St and research survey group Zogby Analytics. Polled adults regarding the quality of customer service at 151 of Americas best-known companies in 15 industries. "Comcast has had bottom-ranked customer service for seven consecutive years. Comcast had the worst customer service reviews of any company this year by a wide margin. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. 1. Comcast > Pct. ratings poor: 28.3%. At 28.3%, more respondents ranked their experience with the company as poor than any other company. Furthermore, 54.4% of those surveyed claimed that their overall customer experience was negative, nearly 10 percentage points higher than the next worst rated company. This is Comcast's seventh consecutive year on the Hall of Shame, and its first year at the top".Business Insider rates Comcast #6 for the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. CheatSheet rates Comcast #1 for the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. According to the American Consumer Satisfaction Index's Comcast #3 for the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. Consumerist Named Comcast THE WORST COMPANY IN AMERICA. Comcast finds itself at the bottom of the American Consumer Satisfaction Index's. Forresters annual report rates Comcast as the lowest TV Service Provider. Consumer Reports also placed Comcast's customer satisfaction near the bottom of the telecom industry. Shall I go on.One customers story. I have been with Comcast for over 18 years. The past several years it is rare that I don't spend hours on the phone on a monthly basis attempting to correct problems with the service or the bill. My internet and phone service has been down for several days at a time - more than a few times in the past 2 years. I have had the cable modem changed out 3 times in as many weeks. Each time I was told the modem did not work or was not the modem. Regarding my bill that was supposed to be consistent if I agreed to a 2 year contract I have called almost on a monthly basis in an attempt to correct. Every month I am told one or a combination of these excuses: 1 - The previous agent did not code it correctly. 2 - The previous agent was incorrect. 3 - The previous agent made notes but did not complete the changes/corrections.Each month I am promised that they would make the proper corrections. The future bills would be correct. I am given exact dates when it will change. Some have even given me their direct phone #. Last month my calls were never returned from this direct #. And yet this months bill was almost double the amount. I have spent dozens and dozens of hours on the phone. Not counting service calls. Even calling Comcast Corporate (BTW the last person not to return a call was the agent assigned to my previous complaint by Comcast Corporate). I have thought about switching to Dish or DirecTV. But they are rated #4 and #2 WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE respectively. I really enjoy the products. However, the time and extreme aggravation caused by the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE leaves me looking and wishing for an alternative.
__label__1 Ordered the TV & Internet double package that I received from Xfinity mailer promotion. When installer arrived, he had been given a different order to install incorrect boxes and service. Some of this problem was corrected while he was doing the install, however after installation, I found I was billed way above the quoted costs. After 3 1/2 hours on the phone with 8 different representatives, I was still not given the package that was advertised and now 2 of the receiver boxes continue to drop signal. I am averaging 11/2 hour per day trying to get this corrected. My internet speed is not the speed I was told I would receive. I tried to replace one of the receivers that is dropping and was sent a box that was not what I ordered. Customer service reps seem to be of no help and only answer any question by reading their prepared texts. Now I find that pending charges exceed quoted prices again. I can guarantee that when my contract expires. Xfinity will never have me as a customer again.
__label__1 In November our promotion ended. I called Xfinity to see what other promotions were currently available and was talked into trying a bundled package with the assurance that if I was not happy, I could cancel the tv service and go back to just Internet for 39.99 a month for 25mbps. I called and attempted to cancel tv service and go back to just Internet for the price quoted as mentioned above. The representative told me I could not do that and 25mbps would cost us 69.99 a month and it was cheaper just to keep tv. She would not let me talk to a supervisor as I requested multiple times so I ended the call and called back a week and a half later when I was having internet issues. I spoke to a customer service rep who removed the tv service and upgraded us to 75mbps for the same price of 49.99 a month. I was ecstatic. She stated I would have to agree to a year commitment, I stated that was fine. I agreed to the terms of 75mbps for 49.99 a month for a year. I looked at our bill today and we are only receiving 25mbps for 39.99 a month and charged 10.00 a month for a speed upgrade?!? I don't even know how this is legal as these are not the terms I agreed to and we are being charged 10 dollars a month for services we aren't receiving. Comcast Xfinity is the worst company to deal with and totally scams its customers.
__label__5 What happened is I reported to Comcast phone helpline on 6/20/2012 that my cable and internet service was suddenly unavailable at my address four days after I paid my account balance to zero until the next billing cycle starts, 7/07. The technicians ultimately appeared 8/22 for the fourth scheduled appointment inside my home (tech appointment **). They first failed to appear as scheduled on 6/27. After the technicians performed 8/22 per schedule, they stated to me that it is impossible I receive cable and internet at my address until their recommendation to install a new underground line is executed. The Online Escalations Team informed me on 8/28 via e-mail that a technician will visit my place in 10-15 business days; evidence of the 9/4 visit yesterday is disturbed earth, new cable outside my home and restored internet and cable service within. The consequential continuous days of no internet or cable service availability at my address, my numerous reports to that effect with various Comcast personnel via phone plus hours of Comcast chat online, were inadequately recognized. Indeed the helpline personnel were actually combative on 8/21 and insisted technician records indicate service was restored previous to the first Escalations Department ticket prepared on 8/17. Because it is my direct experience that Comcast suspended effective customer service to me until 8/22 for a problem that likely could be solved before the 7/07/12 billing cycle, I have not experienced fulfillment of the Comcast guarantee. Comcast chat this date 9/5 of two hours resulted in the analyst preparing a ticket number for the Management Team to address the continued billing for internet and cable TV services when these services were neither provided me nor available until 9/4; which constitutes a service interruption of 76 continuous days. I give Comcast every opportunity to keep me as a loyal customer, pending their planned response the online analyst states is forthcoming within three days from today.
__label__5 For the first 3 weeks after I setup service with Comcast, I had to have about 6 techs come out to work on either my cable TV or internet service. They had to replace my 2 DVR boxes at least 5 times each because they kept replacing them with used units that still had the previous customers recording settings and recorded shows. The hard drives kept freezing up and suddenly failed. I ended up having to contact the Comcast executive customer care department, who finally had a senior level tech from a different region come out to resolve the issues. I am now without issues for about 3 weeks.My suggestion is, if you continue to have issues with Comcast, contact your customer service department and have them forward you to the executive customer care department for your area.  This group generally will take care of you.
__label__1 Most recently, Zach, Technician #** came out at my request and gave me a new X1 set top box and remote. They are awesome and as long as you get a 'real' Comcast Staff Employee out vs. a Contractor, your chances of having problems after they leave are reduced to about 1.0% vs. 99.99%. So, Zach is a Comcast employee. Extremely nice, efficient, cordial and just all around a good guy. He knows what he is doing and he does it. Unfortunately, this is beyond his control, but I had over 75% of my previous set top box filled with shows and movies I had not made it to yet. Zach assured me that these were in the 'cloud' and that they will load shortly.Well, my purchased items showed up, but not all of them. And, only 7 scheduled shows are recording now, when I had an ordered list of over 35 shows to record. I cannot even find the viewing order in order to see if my shows are even still in the correct queue - or in queue at all. I tried Comcast Chat, but no one ever came on. I've been on hold now with Customer Service for 39:03 minutes (with the repeat recording saying "Your estimated wait time is less than one minute.") I am sick to my stomach that not only did my shows get deleted, but the watchlist order I had them in also got deleted. I think it is time to give cable TV up for good and buy a Smart TV and just do HULU and Netflix and save $150 a month. It's a shame because so many people who work there are so good. But, this does not make up for all the bad. And, the bad has been really really bad.
__label__1 I am writing as a potential new customer who cancelled installation at the last minute. Why? Because: I am currently a Comcast Wireless Internet customer who also has DirecTV. I was promised some great promotional prices for TV and Wireless Internet bundling on the phone by a sales agent, which would have amounted to a $40 savings per month. When installer arrived, the prices he had on his work order were suddenly upped to over $40 more per month than I currently pay. I was also promised on the phone by the agent that I would not have to change my current Internet address, even though it is Earthlink.net and not Comcast. This turned out not to be true either, according to the installer.I specifically asked about installation charges and start-up costs prior to ordering the new bundling package, and was told there were none. The night before the installer arrived, I received a last minute email outlining installation costs amounting to several hundred dollars. This was NOT part of the deal, and resent being lied to. I don't like your hardball bait-and-switch tactics. Frankly, this constitutes fraud. Luckily I discovered these things before I opted for your service. If I had found out afterward, I would have called the Better Business Bureau. Maybe I will anyway. I will say that the installer was very nice and polite, and I feel bad that he wasted a trip to my house.
__label__1 I had endless problems with Video On Demand and defective cable box RNG 100 by Cisco. The problem is like a paging file glitch in Windows, where the memory file size is too small for the amount needed to swap to disk, such that the cable box goes into a system hang when accessing and paging through On Demand.The only solution is cold reboot (or Comcast to remotely reboot), a need required with every usage of the On Demand menu. It's a daily problem; every access yields the same result. I have complained almost daily, too (since November 4). Deaf customer service. Canned replies. And it took too long to even get to a human. And even if you call from the Comcast phone, you must go through the litany of saying your name, address, phone number, and last four of your social, even to ask a routine question. So a daily call is quite a time-waster.Box was changed; there's no change in the problem, of course. I was told to order Motorola DCT 2000 or 2500 by a Comcast representative, so I ordered it. And the Comcast person came out having no clue of the order and said the model did not exist. So I just told him to go away. This happened today.I've had to reboot the cable box at least six times since then, about 12 hours later. I had called and spoken to a supervisor who allegedly knew the most about cable boxes, who said he couldn't know what the problem was and was deaf to my explanation in the first paragraph above. There were many more problems than merely the cable box, but this problem is paradigmal of the whole.
__label__1 On March 4, 2014 I placed an order online via Comcast website to have services installed at my home in Jacksonville Florida. Comcast offered online a basic digital service of $19.99 and an installation date on Sunday March 9, 2014. Today I received an email from Comcast advising that it was crucial that I contact a toll free number and speak with a customer service representative to discuss the proper selection, billing, and installation of your chosen services. Upon contacting the customer service representative I was informed that the package I was offered online and that was confirmed online I would receive was not available and the only other basic digital option offered was for a price of $44.99. In addition, the installation date that I chose online (Sunday March 9, 2014) that was also confirmed online was no longer available and the next date was Wednesday March 12, 2014.I am extremely disappointed in the way Comcast portrayed a service package and an installation date to me as a consumer that was never available in the first place and that I was dumped into the lap of an offshore third-party company to handle my dissatisfaction and who has no authority to assist me (the consumer) with my concerns I have as it pertains to the bait and switch practices I have fallen victim. When I asked for an escalation number to voice my concerns I was told to go to Comcast website. Being that Comcast has a monopoly on cable services in Jacksonville my concerns about Comcasts unfair practices as a consumer is warranted for regulatory review. Prior to my filing complaints with all the regulatory agencies and advice from my attorney, I wanted to first provide Comcast with the opportunity to assist me with resolving my legitimate concerns pertaining to unfair consumer practices.Please contact me ASAP to attempt to resolve the issue and restore a customers confidence.
__label__0 On 04/03/09, my email was not working so I called Comcast. They let me know that there was a problem with their service and they apologized. Shortly after that, a Comcast tech showed up here at my home to fix my computer (which by the way I did not order but since he was here, I figured it was a plus since he could now fix the problem). He asked what was the trouble. I explained that my email was not working so he proceeded to try and fix the problem. But instead, he and someone he contacted at Comcast decided that the way to resolve my problem was to change my email; he never asked me if it would be alright. By doing this they did away with my existing email which by the way I've had for 15 years and all my friends, family, banks, doctors and all the businesses I do business with cannot get in touch with me. Now Travis said that all I had to do was set up another email account. That is easy for him to say since it was not causing any problems for him. Here it is 4/6/09 in the evening and I still do not have my email back. They keep telling me they are working on it but nothing has been corrected as of yet. I've left a message for him (Travis **) but I still have not heard from him either. I am very frustrated and upset. I understand that this should never have happened, because no one has the right to change your email without permission. Someone forgot to tell Travis.
__label__1 Comcast has made several appointments to come bury the cable in my yard since October. No one has shown. I have made several calls. They have put in several escalation tickets, yet no one has come out. It is a safety hazard to have this long orange cable across my driveway and walkway. People have tripped over this line. I have made it very clear that it is a safety hazard. They keep promising, not showing, making appointments, and multiple escalation tickets. How many more escalations tickets can they enter? How many more appointments are they going to make? When are they going to show. As a customer I am expected to pay my bill. As a customer, I expect to get service.
__label__0 Comcast internet installer lied to me, conned me into high-speed internet connection. It was good for a certain period of time under an introductory offer. He told me when the introductory offer ended, I would need to call Comcast and have another technician come out to disconnect the high-speed internet connection and that I would have to pay for the service call. I called Comcast customer service, they said that was not true. I believe Comcast in Denver is extorting customers. I am on unemployment and I need my computer to look for jobs online. This type of coercion is nothing more than an act of a bunch of thugs who have hijacked the Denver internet community.
__label__1 Comcast offers a nice selection of free and on-demand movies. The service would be great if you actually could watch your choice of TV show or movie without turning your cable box on and off each time you try to watch TV, or changing the channel because the volume goes out every few seconds. We pay $278.00 a month for the worst possible service. We called and complained many times and they sent out two new cable boxes to replace the old ones. We tried all day to activate both of them. One was activated after about 4 hours and several phone calls. The other is still not working and has absolutely no power to the box. Tried to contact Comcast but the automated system told us there was an outage in our area. I wonder how our other TV is working with an outage in our area. The automated system asked if we wanted a call back when service was restored. I cannot speak with a consumer care person to report the actual problem, which has nothing to do with an outage. Comcast says they will be there 24/7. Guess what? They are not there. I haven't found a good cable company. They are all alike, take your money and provide low quality service. I don't like a lot of regulations but there isn't enough competition with cable companies to get decent service. $278 is a lot of money a month. I think we should get reimbursed when our cable is out or you can't get help to resolve the problem. There should be penalties for not providing the service advertised.We do not get the service as promised and this has been going on for months. They always have an excuse.
__label__1 This is the third time in a month that I've had a negative experience with Comcast. The first time was when I was moving, had an issue, called them twice, sat on hold, got hung up on, and then the same thing happened again the following week. I am now unable to access my email even though I never changed my password and they told me a technician would call me from 5-9 last night, never called, and I have no email.
__label__1 When we sign up with Comcast and we had so much problem with the Internet needing rebooted then after our 3rd call they said would send someone out but they were going to charge us or if we needed to sign up and spend another $4.99 a month on a nearly $200 for a monthly service plan. Well we chewed them out and what do you know we haven't had Internet problems since but our cable is bad. Today we went to do a down grade on our cable because we needed to cut expenses, because our rent went up. They said that they were going to charge us a "cancellation fee"! We told them we are not cancelling just reducing. They said that our contract is for what we have right now and that we can only up-grade but cannot down grade. Well at the end of the school year, our son is home schooled, we are just going to stop paying them. We don't care about our credit because it is already bad because my husband kept losing jobs because of his disability, but now he has his SSD. We are just going to take our laptop to our local library for Internet, get a digital converter for TV, and we have Safe Link for our phone so we will save tons of money once we get rid of this joke of a company.
__label__1 Comcast sent out a letter to notify me of a new modem upgrade. We ordered it to be mailed out at the end of Nov. We never received it and then received an automated message the end of Dec saying "call to order your new modem." Never once did they say we would lose our service, yet since mid-January we very rarely have any service at all. Now the company tells me they will send someone out to install the new modem and update my boxes for $100. Otherwise the company will mail it out for me. I was next transferred to the person who would set me up to receive the modem by mail when she tells me I have to pay $15 for them to mail me out a new modem which they mandate I get. The letter, call and the person I spoke to just before Marcela said it was free to mail it to me and I install it. So, Comcast would like to charge me for doing their job of installing and exchanging their outdated equipment and I should pay for the 6 to 10 days that I do not have service. Yep, that is the way Comcast does business.
__label__5 About 3 weeks ago I switched my basic internet service with Comcast to a Bundle since it was actually cheaper at the time. $59.99 for Performance Internet (50Mbps)/HBO/Basic Cable for 12 months. I confirmed multiple times over the phone with the agent and thought everything was good. Today I called in to check on my current balance since the online system does not update for several weeks (apparently once a billing cycle). I was shocked when my balance was over a $100. The agent told me she did not know of any such package at the price point I was promised, but my account did show full pricing for the internet, some "HD Tech" add-on I didn't ask for, and the cable. So they were able to pile on all the services but not successfully bill me the right amount. Go figure. Fortunately, I called in and after some difficulty was able to get most of the charges removed (we will see, I have been promised things from Comcast before). I switched back to my prior internet-only service with them. Why doesn't Comcast email a receipt for the service change? Are they afraid that something in print could be damaging to their image? They keep everything secret on their end - you have to call in constantly to make sure things are being handled properly, otherwise things just magically slip up. It's an antiquated system from an antiquated company. I just hope the near-future will offer some alternatives for ISPs (Comcast has a monopoly in my area).
__label__1 approved! Charged 150.00 to cancel service and cut my service on the 18th of the month even though I paid thru march 31! One of the worst companies to deal with!
__label__5 Until VERY recently, technicians would lie to you about what service is available, promise items would be deducted from your bill (only to be re-placed on your bill the next month). Now, however, they are MUCH more pleasant, all the way up to average. Pixelation, almost daily; 5-6 outages a year, down from 10-12. Tallahassee, Florida has the highest Comcast bill in the state, for basic Xfinity service. Xfinity would not work with my new TV (an LG), so I had to use a DTA, instead of a set top box, and I am still using that. That prompted Comcast to bill me for BOTH a set top box and a DTA, and I have tried unsuccessfully for six, yes 6, years to get them to stop doing that, until recently. A technician had to come to my house, and I took the opportunity to walk him around my house so he could see for himself how many cable outlets I have and how many TVs I have. That technician SAYS he fixed my problem, and I will no longer be billed for "an additional outlet." We'll see. This is the fifth time someone has promised me that that ** additional outlet would be removed! Oh, they remove it all right, then re-place it on my bill the following month. The "Comcast guarantee": don't bother phoning them about it; you're not going to get through on the phone (after an outage). It will be busy until midnight, when that little guarantee will no longer be available because your incident happened "yesterday."
__label__1 Are you kidding me? I didn't receive a bill after the install and called the company 3 weeks after to check on billing. All I got was the automated system with an ungodly amount due. I suspect my bill is for 3 months and a late fee. When I tried to talk with an agent the automated system informed me that a 5.99 charge would be added to my account. No way I am paying to ask about my bill. This is a despicable business practice. I'm going down to the office in person and chew on a real agent. They are going to wish the company didn't charge to ask questions over the phone. What a ripoff. If you have any alternative to using Comcast, do it, this is this worst company ever.
__label__1 I have had Comcast for years, and I paid my bills on time each month. They always took the money out the 22nd of the month, because I am disabled and my money does not go into the bank till the 3rd Wednesday of the month. Well, this month, they took it out on the 14th; and I got an overdraft from my bank. It cost me $30.00 more. I called Comcast, and they said it was my bank that changed when the money was to be taken out. So I said, "Ok, let me get my bank on the phone while I have you on the line." (I got 2 phone lines in the home.) So I called my bank, and I am good friends with the bank manager. I put them both on speaker phones, and I asked the women from Comcast to please say again what she told me. She did, and the bank manager told her no and that we do not have any control of that because it is when they (Comcast) send out the bank draft. The women called him a liar and hung up on us.I called back and asked to speak to a supervisor. They told me none was available and that one would call me back within 2 hours. Well, I did not get a call back. So, I called them again the next day, and the automatic recorder went through its program and proceeded to now tell me that I owe a past due balance of $137.19. But my bill has always been $77.47. I got another person on the phone, and she proceeded to tell me I owe them for service that has been done because nothing was working right in my home and Comcast came out and wired my whole house when it was completely gutted and remodeled a few years back. I was told by the service man that was just at my home last week that it was done wrong and that he had to change things around. He drilled holes through my house walls and broke a set of my very cherished wine glasses that were custom-made for me. And all that was said was I did not see them.Now today 6/22/12, I had talked with another company rep, who had called me to ask about my service. If they do not want to know how I was treated, then why call and ask, because I let her know how I was treated and that I was very upset. But it seemed like she could also care less! Let me tell you one thing. It seems when you have problems with this company and you call to try to get things worked out, you piss them off and you end up getting a higher bill for whatever they can charge you for. So now, I have 3 boxes that were to be free, and now, I am being charged for each one. Plus, if the boxes don't work and I have to call to get someone out to get them working, I get charged for it now. But I did do one thing. I filed a complaint with the FCC. But most likely, they will sit on their asses and do nothing also. So, I called my bank back and told them to no longer let Comcast take any money out of my account. I am going to file on Monday with the Better Business and any one else I can think off. I hope no one else is being treated like this. But from all the complaints I have read, it is happening all over with every one with Comcast. What is going on with this company?
__label__0 Over a period of at least six months, I continue to get charged for a service I never heard of and never requested. This service is called blast and a $10.00. Charge appears under the internet part of my bill. I have asked that this service be removed as not wanted and Comcast tells me they coded it off the bill and it appears again. Now I'm threatened with service shut off for this fictitious $10.00 charge. The state of New Jersey Consumer Affairs has been placed on notice and I informed Comcast of this as well.
__label__1 I have closed my account in 2012. With the security deposit and additional payments I made, I am expecting refund of about account number - 116.98$. They have agreed on my refund but have never send it. I have called them multiple times, visited their office physically. All efforts in vain. I want my money back. Thanks!
__label__0 I am a loyal Comcast customer abused by rude representative (operator BZB) while paying bill at Marshfield, MA office.On July 1, 2011, I had an upsetting experience here while paying my bill.  There was an error on my balance (recently downsized services and had credit, which wasn't reflected on balance due).  The male service representative (operator BZB) approached me at the counter.  Barely a moment after I inquired about the error, he rudely replied, "I'm not going to spend an hour with you!" He went on to say, "last time I spent 55 minutes with you and later you complained about me."I stood there stunned as he insulted me with a coworker and customers present.  Refusing me service, he made me get in the other representative's line.  Evidently, he held a grudge against me (the consumer) for wasting his time the prior month!  Yes, I spent time reviewing options, figuring out which services to change, etc. I turned in cable boxes for free adapters to save dollars.  Once home, the CC technical department couldn't activate them (operator BZB failed to enter needed codes), causing us a loss of cable for two days! Who should be mad over wasted time and mistreatment?
__label__1 When I set the recorder Comcast will start about 2 or 3 min. early and end 2 or 3 min before the end of the programs so I have to record the next program to see the end. Also Comcast said I had to upgrade even if I did not want to so Comcast could get my home to be a wireless hotspot for them. WOW is it slower. Been online chatting as well as long call and all with no help but it ends with "we will have a specialist call you back". NO CALL BACK.
__label__1 Approximately 1 year ago, I decided to cancel my Comcast cable TV and internet service. I switched to DirecTV. After about a year with DirecTV, I became dissatisfied with them and went back to Comcast. I ordered Comcast. It was installed, no problems. After having the service for about a month, with no notice, they disconnected my service. They stated I owed them $675.00. When I called and cancelled my service a year ago and switched to DirecTV, they continued to charge me for months. I canceled over the phone. They stated they have no proof of this as their recorded conversations are only kept for 3 months. This is an outrage and nice scam they inflict on their customers.
__label__1 On two different billing periods within the last two months I have been charged for pay per view porn charges. The last month billing the online customer service stated the charges were from one of three cable boxes. The charges were over $200.00. This month I was charged with over $64.00 in pay per view porn charges. Since the last months billing, I created a password and verified with paying for movies. The one affected cable box is connected to an Xbox. Comcast is adamant there could not be any way the box was hacked. I asked Comcast to identify the source of the issue. They state someone has access to my pass code and ordered the movies. I have sent Comcast, through what they say "Ask Tom" a formal complaint. I don't want other consumers to be charged for fraudulent charges.
__label__1 I have had the worst experience with Comcast and they are not even my service provider and NEVER will be. My father passed away in June and unfortunately had cable through Comcast. When I called to cancel his account, a very rude woman would not let me because I am not an "authorized user" on his account. Really?! He's dead! Why would you not let me cancel the account? She was extremely rude and said that it would be illegal to let me cancel because of federal law. If that was true, then why did Verizon Wireless and Farmer's Insurance let me cancel? Pretty sure if there was a federal law against it, then they wouldn't have let me either. She told me my only option was to fax or email the death certificate and gave me the information. Problem is, when I tried to email it, the email address came back invalid. Then, I tried to fax it multiple times and there was a busy/not responding message that came back every time. A month or so later, I was finally able to go to a Comcast location and cancel. Then, I get a bill from collections for my deceased father saying that he owes for services provided after he had already passed, because THEY WOULD NOT LET ME CANCEL IT!!! How crazy that now they want to be paid because of their terrible policies that would not let me cancel the account for almost 2 months after he passed? Absolutely ridiculous. I will NEVER use Comcast because of this situation. The customer service was horrible and they apparently enjoy ripping off and taking advantage of people who have lost their loved ones. Shame on you, Comcast!!!!
__label__1 I spend about $200 a month on Comcast services. My Internet access on three out of the five home wireless devices stopped working or work intermittently. Comcast wants me to spend more money with them; using new signature services to get technical support for my wireless problems. This is even though everything worked perfectly until two weeks ago.I had my laptop checked at Staples, and it connected instantly to their wireless system. The problem lies with my service to Comcast; they will not help me, unless I pay more special service fees. I resent this greatly and feel exploited by them. If I can economically change providers, I will. I also will get my technical support from Staples because I feel ripped off by Comcast. It is their equipment and their service that I am not receiving consistently, and it is not because my equipment is defective. Comcast wants more money from me to sort the problems out--no!
__label__0 
__label__1 I cancelled my cable service about 8 months ago with no issues. I kept my internet service and just used the basic channels that I received by plugging directly into the wall. Several days ago the channels I was receiving were encrypted to prevent me from watching them anymore. I decided to get my Comcast television back. I never returned the cable boxes when I originally cancelled my service. I was told by several different customer help technicians that I could use those same cable boxes and everything would work properly. After the negotiations of price for the products and refinancing my house to pay for it, I purchased basic cable and internet. The customer help department sent out signals to the cable boxes that I had. After several attempts I was still not receiving a signal. After talking to several different people (because I kept getting disconnected), I was told to go to the closest Comcast building and swap out the cable boxes. The first 9 people that I talked to were from some other country that spoke broken English and had a thick accent that I could not decipher. Once I was able to talk to an English speaking representative that knew more than what was written on a cue card, they explained to me that after so many months without use, the product becomes inactive and can't reactivate it. I drive to the closest Comcast building and explain what happened and they were very polite and helpful. I came home to set up my equipment and hooked everything up as instructed. I called the number that was provided to activate my equipment. One of my cable boxes accepted the signal and began working right away. The other one was unsuccessful. I contacted customer help again which was short lived due to being disconnected again. Once again I contacted customer help to have the lady on the phone attempt to send another signal to the device. After the failed attempt she thought that she could send the signal again and fix it. After several failed attempts of sending the same signal to the same device, she finally recommended I return to the local Comcast building and exchange this device for another one. I have had more hassle dealing with this company as a whole in the last 48 hours than I have with any other business over the course of 10 years. Most of the employees that you talk to on the phone don't know what they are talking about and can only read whats on the cue cards in front of them and/or speak broken English with a thick accent that keeps you from understanding what they are trying to tell you. I suggest stop contracting this service to people in the Philippines and use United States citizens that speak fluent English and have a working knowledge of the company. Take pride in your company and the people you hire. The majority of your employees do not have a clue on how to help you solve the problem that you have, no matter how simple it may be. So after paying 75$ a month for a service that only cost me 30$ four days ago, I am contemplating leaving this company as a whole and making sure that all the people that I know and come in contact with on a regular basis hear my side of the story in an attempt to open their eyes.
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer for over 10 years. I have had a temporary set back and needed to move in with a friend for a few weeks. So, I returned my equipment to Comcast on 6/28/2014. I was told I had about a $150 refund due and the clerk processed it. After 4 weeks (8/1/2014), I called Comcast back to inquire about the refund. I was told that my refund initiation had not started. The telephone person said it would be started now and take another 3 weeks to get the check out. I just called today (8/19/2014) and was told that my refund was denied, because I did not return my equipment. Now I have to get my receipt (luckily I kept it) and go back to where I returned the equipment. I received no notification of any of these "refund interruptions". What if I did not keep my receipt. I think their plan is to make the refund process so painful, that I do not follow through. Or they are hoping that I (and I would guess most people) would not keep their receipt. They have all my old Comcast equipment numbers in their computers. Why do I have to go figure out what happened to the equipment they "lost"?
__label__1 It is no wonder Comcast has such a terrible reputation. First person I spoke with was from the Philippines after spending over 15 grueling minutes on the phone as I had difficulty understanding the person who was trying to convince me the "Regional Sports Fee" was a state tax (which is B.S.). He said he would transfer me to someone who was fluent in English. The second person was even worse, I couldn't understand him at all. He transferred me to someone else, also with a foreign accent who finally transferred me to someone in Michigan who I could understand. That is 4 people I spoke with trying to get an answer.When I questioned the "Broadcast TV Fee" ($3.25 to $5.00, a 54% increase) and "Regional Sports Fee" ($4.25 to $8.00, a 88% increase) plus that I don't even like or listen to sports, but we have to pay a fee for something we don't use. She also tried to spin that it was a "government fee", more B.S. She then tried to explain it by saying Comcast costs are going up. Right. Please show me where Comcast costs are going up 54% or 88%. Perhaps increases in executive salaries and so-called athletes salaries are increasing that much. One of the reasons I don't watch sports is the ridiculous incomes the industry demands.Comcast is lying to and ripping its customers off not only by forcing a fee on many people who don't use that particular service but increasing the fees by exorbitant amounts and lying about the increase when the consumer price index is only going up 0.5% while average American wages & salaries are at 20 year lows!!
__label__1 Recently I have had three extremely annoying contacts with Comcast. The first: My bill was charged automatically to my credit card. The card expired, I forgot to contact Comcast. My fault. A young woman, who had been programmed to prattle, called and in her sing-song chant informed me that my bill was past due and my service would be canceled if I didn't pay it. I asked how that could be when my bill was automatically charged to my credit card. "I dont know anything about that, I am just calling to tell you..." She could not connect me to someone who knew something.I went on line and saw that the problem was my card expiration. The system would not let me change it, but gave me a number to call. I got a computer. Before I could complete my payment the connection was broken. Called again. Held out for a human. Gave payment information. She said there appeared to be a payment in the system that had not gone through. It would take 24 hours to see if it went through, then she would try again. She said I could not set my account to be charged automatically to my credit card until the payment went through. I thought, that at least my current bill was taken care of. A few days later, my service was canceled. This involved more exhaustively long phone calls but finally got payment made and service running. I was not happy, but I was not furious.The second incident. Now I am furious. Some of my email comes and some does not. I was not receiving confirmations for hotel reservations from hotels I've used before with excellent service. It took expensive international phone calls to learn that the responses had been sent but not received. Then, I got letters from two banks where I have accounts saying their emails to me were being returned. I called Comcast. The nightmare began. The first person could not resolve the problem: she said a highly trained technician would call me in one to two hours. Four hours later I called the same Comcast number again. I got Andrew, a pleasant young man who assured me he could resolve my email problems, but in the meantime, wanted to sell me a different Comcast package. It was cheaper, faster, and included more cable channels. After some discussion I agreed. He then said he would fix my email problem and call me back in less than an hour. That was the end of Andrew.The next morning, my missing email had not been restored. At 2:00 PM; tried to get online; got a page telling me how to install my new Xfinity devices. I didn't have any new devices, but I could not get on line. I called Comcast. Got Bertha, who was polite and seemed to be trying to fix the problem. After a long session our connection was broken. She had my phone number, but didnt call back. I called and started all over with Ann. Ann eventually passed me off to Katrina who after another extended session of accomplishing nothing said she needed to connect me to billing. I asked what billing could possibly have to do with it. She assured me they could fix it. Tonya in billing was very pleasant, but was clueless as to why Katrina thought it was a billing issue. Tonya handed me off to Kim.Kim wins the Totally Useless award. At one point she explained to me, that there should be two things on my desk. The big one with the picture was the monitor. She said the other would be a tall plastic black or white box. It is called a CPU. I was probably using a computer before the little ** was born. I told her I knew what a CPU was, and mine, a Mac mini, was seven inches square and an inch or so high. I dont think she believed me.At one point she said, when I do this we may lose our connection, but I will call you back (I've heard that one before). I asked why doing something to the modem would affect our telephone connection. In a voice heavy with exaggerated patience, because your phone is plugged into your modem. No it isn't. We argued the point for a while. I insisted that my phone had absolutely nothing to do with my modem or computer. She didn't believe me. She said, well, if its not plugged into your modem, where IS it plugged in? I explained that it was plugged into a jack in the wall. Apparently she didn't believe that either. She said again that we might lose our connection. I said okay. Amazingly we did not lose our phone connection when she tinkered with my modem. Nor did I regain my internet.She passed me on to Rhonda. Rhonda had a friendly pleasant voice and seemed knowledgeable and efficient. It must have been a slip-up in the hiring process. She rather quickly determined that she could not resolve the problem and scheduled a technician to come out. It was after five when I got off the phone. The next day, a new modem arrived via UPS shortly before Chad the technician did. Chad was pleasant and efficient and discovered that dear old Andrew had switched the numbers from my old modem to one that had not even been shipped at that point. Chad installed the new modem. Internet works fine. I have no idea if my email problem has been resolved or not. I wont know unless someone notifies me that they tried to send an email that didn't go through.Third issue. I was away for several weeks, and came home to a past due Comcast bill. For $240. $154 for February and $85 for March. According to Andrew, my new plan would be $69 a month. He mentioned no additional charges. I looked up the bill online. I found $77 charged for unexplained other services plus billing that added up to well over $69 a month. I found a number to call for billing issues. Got a person whose name was apparently Rain. He spoke in heavily accented English and didn't seem to understand the issue. I asked him to explain the $77 for other services. We got nowhere. I finally asked to speak to a supervisor. He continued to talk (apparently reading the charges from my bill over and over, but explaining nothing) while I repeatedly said, I would like to speak to a supervisor please. After 20 minutes on the phone I hung up. I sent a complaint through customer service on the Comcast website. Got an immediate response saying someone would contact me within 24 hours. That was March 18, today is April 2, still no contact. As soon as I notify all of my email correspondents of my new gmail address, Comcast will be history and WOW will be my carrier.
__label__1 I was charged for a tech to come out and fix my cable due to defective equipment. Unbelievable! Im on hold for 30 minutes just to speak with a manager and theres no help. Theyre saying too bad, not their fault. Not only that, they blew my TV one year earlier for not grounding the wires in the basement when they first installed cable at my house.
__label__1 This is the worst company for customer service, I moved and ordered their services for my new location. At the time I ordered, the agent was very nice and offered me a package that included the home security system and all the movie channels for 1 year for $145/month and I accepted. They could only install it during the week when I was not home, so my daughter sat at my house and waited for the installer. After he was done she signed and he left. When I got home I was very disappointed with the security system. It only covers 2 doors which leaves the other 2 doors and the 3 patio doors completely unprotected. What's worse the system does not work, it never goes off! Then I had no movie channels. I called to complain and they said they would send someone out and activate the movie channels no one ever came out and when I received my bill I was charged $400 because of the movie channels. I contacted corporate and after numerous phone calls I managed to get my bill down. The problem now is that this system still does not work. When I tried to cancel it I was told sure but it would cost $600 cancellation fee I told her the system does not work and she once again offered to send someone out but they cannot cover the doors. So I am stuck paying ADT for home security and paying Comcast for a box that occasionally beeps.
__label__1 Where do I start - from the beginning we've had trouble with these crooks. Installation was flawed - called and was promised a tech MULTIPLE times - no shows. Finally I went to their office in person and raised hell with a manager who tried to threaten me - that didn't work (helps to know the law....). Finally had two techs with the proper equipment show up to fix MULTIPLE issues with the original crap installation. Since then we've had multiple service outages. OnDemand often throws a "service not available" message, internet speeds vary DRAMATICALLY, and tonight I'm trying to watch a movie and the soundtrack gets garbled about every 5 minutes making me have to pause the movie and then restart it to fix audio. HOW ON EARTH can these idiots continue to be in business and be allowed to provide such completely incompetent service??? Can anyone spell CLASS ACTION against these twits? To charge what they do and fail to provide acceptable, consistent service is criminal.
__label__1 Okay, I had this technician come out about 2 weeks ago to hook up my Xfinity voice and internet service. He goes out back and sees my small garden blocking the area he had to work. So instead of avoiding my plants, this fool pulls up my wooden border and tosses it in the yard. He also stomped on all my plants like they weren't there. The wooden border is heavy with about 3 or 4 large nails sticking out. The thing was in my yard with the nails up... Anyone could have come through and stepped on it or tripped on the log. My son is the one who found it and informed me after he had left.Also, before he finished work at my house and before my son discovered the mess made outside, he left and said he had to go elsewhere to finish another job then come back to my house. He left and came back 45 minutes later then had the nerve to sit on my couch for 10-15 minutes saying he had to wait until a certain time to "clock in". WTF? So, you're gonna sit in my house watching TV until it's time to work? Really? I called Comcast and filed a complaint. I was told I would hear something after Memorial Day. I still haven't and I don't think I will because they just don't give a damn. But they had my bill posted to the account 2 days later.
__label__0    We bought a new house in frederick, MD.  I understand it would take a little while for comcast to come out and hook up cable.  April 24 , 2008 contacted a general contractor for COMCAST ( a joke)he stated that he would be able to come out and hook me up real soon.  Never happended if fact will not call back and stated that it would probably take about 2 months to get hooked up.  APRIL 28, 2008 had a ticket or der since then and have been promised many time s to be contacted by supervisers but never have.  I have school and need internet to complete school.  I am very frustrated with the lie's and the promises.  I have tried direct TV but they cannot hook me up because of the way the house sits and where the grounding wire is.  So I have no choice but to go with COMCAST.  This really makes me upset.
__label__5 Customer services is OK. Tech support - depends on who you get on the phone. Most of the time it is someone who can only read from a script. We pay for channels we never watch - need a la carte. Internet is very reliable, but Xfinity X1 not ready for prime time. Many system hangups, lost recordings, software hangups requiring almost daily reboots of the X1 box, X1 box noisy, aspect ratios inconsistent between HD and non-HD channels, recording often cut off near the end and finally the daily forced reboot at night is obtrusive and shows how crappy the Xfinity software is.
__label__1 There appears to be on going issues with the digital box. There is constant freezing whenever you're exploring the offered films and shows available on the networks offered. Whenever the playlist are chosen for viewing later, it is erased or suddenly unavailable for viewing. Numerous times are spent restarting the box to hopefully reset the digital box, but to no avail, the problems persist. Customer service is ineffective, no one seems to be able to assist. A very displeased customer considering the cost of the digital box.
__label__1 This has been the worst experience of any cable company I've ever had... The representatives are horrible. Service is a nightmare. This company is criminal to the highest power! It takes months to correct any error! In the meantime they charge outrageous prices while never correcting their own mistakes. Internet speeds are never what they say it is. Customer Service is a nightmare and never if ever address the issues.
__label__1 To make a very long, agonizing story short, I've had Comcast about 5 years. Over the past 2 weeks, I've received the worst customer service I've ever had from any company anywhere. The trouble started 2 weeks ago when our main DVR box went out. After several missed and re-scheduled appointments, I started to wonder. I pay $250-plus a month for their service, which, first of all, is nothing special. In 2 weeks, they have failed to show up for 4 appointments. When I missed their "conformation" call this afternoon after not getting to the phone in time to answer the techs two-ring-and-then-hang-up call, I called back in and she said, Yes, since you didn't answer, we need to reschedule your appointment for next Wednesday. I was like, Uhm, no. So, anyways, I talked to many reps and all were happy to please me while on the phone and then we never heard back from anyone. I'm forced into a contract with them because AT&T does not offer U-verse in our area yet. So if we want cable or internet, they're the only carrier in my area. As soon as it's available, I plan to cancel them very quickly! It's appalling. I'm literally sick to my stomach. After dozens of calls, our service is still out! Just be careful, new customers! They have very appealing new offers. But prices soon go up and the customer service is absolutely awful! I am very upset with Comcast!
__label__0 Wireless connection keeps dropping. Call for help and follow their prompts and wind up repeatedly at the wrong department then a person sends you to a wrong department and so on.  Inability to use the service I am PAYING for on a daily basis.
__label__1 I feel like Comcast should come and hook my services up.  I have been a longtime Comcast costumer.  When I called to get my services transferred, they knew I needed new wiring and they didn't say that I had to pay 50 dollars for an installation fee they set up to appointments. I feel like they should hook up my cable without charging me the 50 dollars.  I am not happy.
__label__1 I was promised if I leave DirecTV, Comcast would get me out of my contract with DirecTV, to join Comcast. Comcast sent a sales representative Gregory ** to my home in 2012, tracking number ** and told me if I join Comcast, they will get me out of my contract with DirecTV. He did not and DirecTV says I owe them 360 dollars. I do not, Hazlet, NJ 08723. Comcast came to me and also told me most of all the customers there went with Comcast. They promised me they would take care of this. Now I've been getting sick over this whole thing. Please someone help me, I am disabled and on a tight income.
__label__1 I've had Comcast at my current address for the last 16 yrs. Comcast is charging me for movies that were never ordered. This has been going on for the last 3 months. Comcast had their research dept look into this issue and have credited me for the last 2 months, but are refusing to credit me the $400+ in recently charged films. The movies in question are adult films (porn) which was not ordered by me or anyone else. I've changed the modem and cable boxes twice. I also have a block on every TV along with a required pin code in order to get anything on demand. I have no children and there is no way anyone can be ordering this from inside my house. I'm a breast cancer survivor, fighting to regain my health and my life. I'm a good person and I do for others. How could this be happening to me? Please help.
__label__1 This is beyond any doubt the worst company I have ever dealt with in my 75 years of doing business. I put them on auto pay when I first signed up and their billing was so screwed up that I could not trust them so I removed auto pay and delay with them thru snail mail. Their bill would come late and when it arrived I would pay my bill and they would try to charge me a late fee. I could never get a clear understanding of the charges and how they billed even when I got someone who spoke English well enough to understand.I moved from Cal to Washington and use their moving department who promised me a certain price and a $300 credit card... I set a moving date which I had to change by a couple of days. When that happened the deal changed although they did not tell me at the time that I changed the installation day. Later I found out that the price had all gone up and I lost my $300 card because I had simple delayed the installation date. I move to DirecTV and FILO internet and so far so good.
__label__0 Comcast has been charging us $45 a month for high speed internet access.  Comcast took over the lines here in Mendocino County, CA from Adelphia which provided internet at a speed up to 1.5megs/sec download.  The speed has steadily decreased under Comcast's takeover. It is a 2/3 reduction in speed in some cases.  Moreover I found out tonight that I am paying for 6 megs a sec. So I am getting 1/12th of what I am paying for. I have been timed out three times, the last after 15 minutes of trying to get it out and less than1/2 completion. I am unable to get what I am paying for or reliable upload and downloads at the speed I am paying for.  My contacts therefore cannot get important documents that are part of a political campaign.
__label__1 Comcast should be shut down because of criminal practices. Comcast never installed the correct equipment needed for us to access the services we are paying for. This has been going on for half a year. We are paying $159.99 each month, and our problems still are not resolved. This company has a monopoly, and they know it.
__label__1 The NFL RedZone advertises that you "see every touchdown from every game". You do see every touchdown. BUT!!! I hope that's the only part of the game you care to see! With DirecTV, I could find my Chiefs game and watch the ENTIRE GAME... START to FINISH. Unfortunately, now that I am roped into a 2 year contract with Xfinity, I find out they don't offer any such package. The best you can do is "RedZone" which is crap! For example, Chiefs went into overtime vs. Chargers week 1. The problem was, RedZone promptly switched off my game to begin the following game, leaving me with only highlights (and yes, every touchdown) from the rest of my game! What a crock, these people! I will fulfill my 2 years, and then I will switch back and never want to hear the words "XFINITY" or "REDZONE" again!!!
__label__0 when I subscribe to cable latino optimo with comcast cable they toldme I will be able to watch chanels fom 1 to 99  now I'm paying $6.00 dolars more per month and getting less chanels .I call the company and complaint about it they toldme I was getting all those chanels by accident because they weren't able to bolck them .they should give the costumers the right information before they get the service .I feel this is scam.
__label__5 What customer support? A problem... be prepared to be transferred at least 3-4 times and still most likely not have the issue resolved. They also lie about the bundling package prices. The X1 upgrade.. we were told we MAY get up to 75 mbps. We already had 25 mbps which they said could be average. What kind of "upgrade" is that? Then they give you a price, but when you receive the email confirmation, it's not at all what was discussed. Extremely deceptive tactics to lock you in for 2 years at really no discount. The internet goes out all the time. Pay more for less... That's their motto. The popular packages are removed from lower packages and put in higher ones to get you to pay them even more to get the channels you regularly watch. Mediocre. 
__label__0 I ordered xfinity service and I have still not received my phone service and it's been over a month. They are trying to get me to fix the problem and it's been impossible. No return phone calls as promised from supervisors, etc.
__label__0  I recently ordered Comcast internet service. When the tech arrived, he started installing the modem. In the middle of the install he received a personal phone call. He proceeded to carry on a conversation with what sounded like his wife during the whole install. I was in the living room when the tech stated, "You're all set." He rushed me through the signing of the paper work, and then he bolted out the door. I then went to get online and nothing--my computer wouldn't even boot! I tried over and over to get my computer to boot up, and nothing. I called a tech from the company that built the computer, explained what was going on, and was very upset to find out that the tech fried my mother board! He crossed wires or plugged something into the wrong slot. I am now going round and round with Comcast, their contractors, and back. Everyone is pointing their fingers at others. I lost all use of my computer and gained a $45.00 a month bill for a service I cant even access. Comcast needs to replace my computer.
__label__1 I am currently being sued by Comcast without a reason. I am actually in collection but my account is up to date and my balance is at 0. When I moved to my new rental I made the transfer effective March 1 and I moved and did not get my service installed until March 10 and it took the guy 15 minutes to install the service. No one bothered to let me know that my account number was changed and so was my phone number. I found out because my family was calling and getting a disconnect recording. When I tried calling them back from my house number, that is when I found out I had a new number. Hmm, all this time I took it and was glad to get my service. I did write a nasty letter to the CEO, who doesn't really care and got a phone call from some woman at his office offering apologies for all my struggles and my bill was going to be reduced due to a misunderstanding of some wall outlets that I was charged for but didn't need and never got. Long story short, I am now being sued by Comcast for an account cancellation that occurred in May 2013 according to the collection agency. However, the account number does not match my old account or my new account number. I have written letter after letter asking for a resolution and no response. Now my credit is being screwed up by something that is not even my fault and no one seems to care that this company is just out of control. Any suggestions?
__label__1 I signed up for Comcast internet in August 2011. My promotion was $29.99 for 6 months, at which time, the rate would increase to $44.95. This latest bill should have been the first bill at the increased price, but when I opened it, they're charging me $62.95. I called them and they claimed they can't find that promotion. Not only that, but the people you speak to on the phone have no control over the online promotions. Calling in on the phone is different than online.  What? This is so dishonest. I can't even believe, especially since they've been pushing this customer service guarantee. They've always been incompetent, since I started dealing with them years ago, but this is just dishonest, as well as bad business process. They also told me on the phone, that they've been getting a lot of complaints about the online promotion. Shouldn't that tell them something?
__label__1 First off, when they showed up to install, they did a shoddy job. The installers never hooked up the broadband phone service, I had to do that. All cable wiring was ran through windows, I have never seen that done before. The TV system has never worked properly and the wrong box was installed in the bedroom, it took a month to get a tech to correct that. The internet is slower than the DSL connection I had, but it is supposed to be faster. Now with all of that, we decided to still give Comcast a try and we kept it. 3 days ago, my wife paid the bill using their automated pay system. Our cable was shut off anyway due to non-payment. I called the customer service department and gave them the information, including the confirmation number. I was treated like I was trying to get something past them when I just wanted to know about my payment. After several calls, the service was not restored and I hit the rudest people on the planet earth! None of them wanted to solve this by checking to see what happened to the payment. All they could do was basically say the payment was not made. I went ahead and made the payment again, but now there are two pending payments on my bank account for Comcast. To this date, the second one still has not been found. My bank said Comcast claimed it, but Comcast said they have not. As soon as I can get a new company in here for internet, TV and phone, I will change. Run from them! It's not worth the hassle!
__label__1 I have charges on my bill that are not mine for xfinity home sensor pack. I have tried to have these charges removed for over a month! Only to be put on hold for 10-20 minutes, disconnect, transferred to the wrong department, once transferred to another company that had no affiliation with Comcast! This issue has still not been resolved. How is Comcast still in business????!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I discontinued service with Comcast in April and turned in their equipment and awaited a final bill. A month later they send me a bill for 300 and change bill. When I tried to check the bill online I was locked out of my Comcast account. I called their very unhelpful billing department and was advised that they had not put the final amount I owed Comcast minus the equipment I turned in at least a month prior. I called Comcast numerous times. Every time I was told a new bill would be generated with the correct amount owed and would mailed to me. During this time they put me in collection for 70 dollars that they claimed was owed to them and Stellar Credit (a collection agency) reported me negatively 2 times on my credit. Finally my 7th or 8th call I was able to get a photo copy of bill sent to me that I paid. The charge from Comcast cleared on my credit card on July 30th. On August 3rd I get a call from Stellar Credit who advised me of an outstanding balance owed to Comcast so he connects me with them who acknowledges that paid them. A few days later I check my credit which was not fixed and call Comcast back. Comcast tells me they have no record that I paid the bill to them and say I still owe them 70 dollars. The billing person promises that he will open an investigation to figure out if I paid them. A few days later I call Comcast back to find out where the investigation is. The billing agent has no idea what Im talking about and promise that the investigation must be on track. So now its been well over 10 days since the supposed investigation and no word from Comcast, plus they reported another negative comment on my credit on the 17th. Comcast has refused to work with me to fix this issue and fix my credit that has dropped over 100 points. They are clearly not trying to fix the problem.
__label__0 I asked Comcast if I could reduce my services with the company. I have a bundle package which includes Cable, phone and Internet. The company said that I would be able to adjust the package to a price I would be able to afford but they will charge me a $150 cancellation fee. I was not canceling their service, I only needed a better-priced plan. Is this legal?
__label__0 I paid the cable bill by check. COMCAST did not credit my account the $165 amt for the entire amt of the bill. I faxed the canceled check to COMCAST (Keisha). COMCAST turned off my service last night. I called Keisha again and she said she couldn't do anything about it unless I paid an additional $165 and she would talk to her supervisor about it. EMOTIONAL DISTRESS and COMCAST IS DOUBLE CHARGING ME!
__label__0 On Friday, October 2nd, I contacted Comcast on the phone to inquire about upgrading my internet service from my existing speed to the 50 Mb/second service. For those that do not know, this requires a cable modem that is DOCSIS 3.0 compliant. My existing cable modem is not DOCSIS 3.0 compliant, so I knew I needed a new cable modem. I am fully capable of installing equipment and getting line check information. I asked the Comcast representative on the phone what was required, and her initial response was that my service area was not upgraded to 50 Mb/second speeds. I informed her that it was as I knew someone in the area that had the service. She said she had to check and would call back.Five minutes later she called back and confirmed that, indeed, the service was available. She also informed me that it would cost $99/month; it would require renting a modem from Comcast at a monthly fee, and would require a $29.95 installation charge. I told her that I didn't want to pay $29.95 for someone to come in and disconnect my existing modem and hook up a new one as I could do that. She refused to waive the charge, and I told her that would cost Comcast $99/month of lost revenue. Researching on Comcast's website showed that the service fee was either $9.95 or $99.95 to connect to the 50 Mb/second service. I have no idea where the $29.95 fee came from. Later on that same day I made a post on Comcast's forums detailing my phone call experience. George, from Comcast, read the message and responded immediately that he would help.On Saturday, with George's suggestion, I had purchased the required modem and emailed George the MAC address. By Monday morning George had done a line test (remotely), I hooked up the new modem, and George provisioned it (remotely). By 10:30am on Monday I was running at the increased speeds with no installation fee. So, it appears that Comcast does have representatives that go that extra mile to make things right. I can understand the fees for those that are not able to do the installations. However, Comcast should be able to work with their customers to get them the service they want without unnecessary fees when those customers can do without a representative coming to the house.
__label__1 It totally sucks!! Don't go for Comcast, they are bad at just everything they do. I have to call them almost every day. Nobody knows nothing in that organisation. Everybody tells you different thing every time you call them. Their services do not work neither they bill it correctly. Credits that they say will be applied because of non working of services are never applied if they do they take it out from you the same amount in the very next bill. They tell you to sign some document and they add some different services. They just give you satisfaction on call saying that they will do it but they never do. Please suggest me some good services for my business. It's getting impacted because of "COMCAST".
__label__5 First off, this idea of a publicly access wireless gateway is a REALLY bad and terrible idea. Too many security and potential LEGAL issues. Unfortunately, I was force to "upgrade" to the XFINITY wireless gateway. It took "an act of congress" and I am still not convinced that that portion of the gateway is turned off. Very bad idea, indeed. Because I was forced to use this wireless gateway, Comcast has charged me an extra 145 on my most current bill. RIDICULOUS! I did all the work and they have the nerve to charge me extra??!!! I am not impressed at all.
__label__0 I was having playback problems with my DVR, both picture and sound, so I set an appointment to get a new one. When the technician came, the first DVR was making mechanical noises so the technician went back to his truck and brought in a second DVR. After 2 days, I was experiencing gaps in playback of no sound. So, I called for another DVR which had 30 shows existing on it that I had to manually erase, and Channel One On Demand does not work even after unplugging for 30 seconds to reset the unit (no help). The sound only works when I have it on full volume (totally unacceptable). In other words I got some old broken box. What gives with Comcast quality, it is sadly lacking.
__label__1 We are new customers who moved to Woodstock GA. Comcast was the unfortunate choice for wifi/tv service in the area. I called on June 6 to schedule our service tech to come out on Monday, June 15. The customer service rep said that they couldn't schedule past Saturday, June 13, 2015. REALLY??? That's 1 week out!!! What kind of calendar are they working with??? We were moving in on the 15th of June, and would not be in the home for a tech to come on Sat the 13th. She said we could make the appt and then reschedule it for a more convenient time once we were moved in. Monday, June 15, we picked up the equipment at a store located 40 min away because we needed to have some kind of TV and Internet service at our home before a technician could come and do the official installation. At the Marietta Xfinity store, I received 1 modem, 3 cable boxes and no remote controls!!! The girl who gave me my equipment had the nerve to ask for 5 stars on her review!!! She should get 1 star for not verifying the total equipment she gave me!!! Cant turn on cable boxes with NO REMOTES!!! DUHHH!!! Tuesday, June 16, we had a Wifi signal that disappeared that night. We had already started service and now had NO SERVICE!!! I called and spoke to 4 different people, all of which told me different things. One rep said my service was cancelled. Another rep said to take the modem back and see if a new one would fix the problem. Wed, June 17, got a new modem and the remotes that we should have gotten with our cable boxes, and still NO INTERNET!!! I was asked for a service technician to come out and fix this problem and they said that the soonest they could get someone out was the FOLLOWING TUESDAY THE 23RD!I'm a BRAND NEW CUSTOMER and I would have to wait another week for service?? Come on!!! I asked for a supervisor to please see if they could rush this since I work from home and need access to internet service. They said they would ESCALATE the problem and I would receive a call from Comcast on Friday June 19. Someone called my cell from Comcast on Friday but DID NOT Leave a message for me. Sometime during Thursday June 18, we got a signal in our house to be able to watch 1 TV out of the 4 rooms. I also found 1 signal for the modem in a upstairs room that is not my office where my computer is located. Saturday June 20, we called and spoke to a few reps that said they would ESCALATE the problem again and that a tech would call me on Sunday, June 21 at 10:40am to let me know that they would be out to fix the problem that day!!!I was happy to hear that news... However, I was hesitant that anything would happen with this. The rep told me that since it was late in the day Saturday that they couldn't send some out and that Sunday June 21, there was a tech available. On Sunday June 21, 1040am came and went!!! NO PHONE CALL from Comcast. I called Comcast at 11:30 to find out what happened with the tech. A rep named ** said that the tech that was scheduled was the wrong one and that the rep on Saturday who told us we would be taken care of didn't have the authority to schedule a tech. OH and to add insult to injury, our appt that had been scheduled for June 23rd for 1 week now had now been CHANGED TO SATURDAY JUNE 27 WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!! I lost my mind at this point because that June 23rd appt was to resolve all connectivity issues I had since the beginning, and to properly install our cable boxes with the TVs in each room and make sure that we had a 4 way splitter so our rooms would all be Xfinity ready. All the while, no courtesy phone calls from Comcast to let us know whats happening with our service. I called today to let them know that I would be cancelling service on Wednesday June 24th if they didn't send someone out before Thursday June 25 to rectify this bull crap. They supposedly ESCALATED me again and told me that I would get a call from dispatch within the hour to see about scheduling someone before Thursday the 25. Guess what, NO CALL and the escalation ticket was CLOSED OUT because no service tech is available before Thursday June 25. NO COURTESY call to inform me either!!!All in all, I don't ever want to do business with Comcast. They should be called Crap Cast, because all they give you is crap!!!! No follow up, a lot of lip service, bull crap lies about service being handled and just a huge debacle of MASS INEPTITUDE at its FINEST!!! I don't even know how the hell they stay in business!!! I was a happy Verizon FIOS customer in Pittsburgh, with not one single problem!!! But they don't offer Fios here!!! That's the biggest hardship for us!!! Comcast holds their customers hostage and they do nothing to compensate for their substandard service. All they keep saying is they will give us a credit for the inconvenience of the service not being done. There have been no credits on our accounts, only increases in the amounts we owe, which I will NOT BE PAYING!!! Comcast can kiss my butt!!! We will not be doing business with a company that keeps pushing its customers off into the abyss.
__label__0 I received a call(3/18/2009) from the Comcast equipment department saying I still had equpment for them I had already returned in July 2008.  I moved from that location over 9 months ago and I am not sure I can find the receipt.  I called the customer service office to find out why I was on this list.  Allan, a Customer Service rep answered the phone, he was very rude,did not want to help to look up my information.  I told him I wanted to speak to a supervisor and he then put me on hold for over 5 mins.  When he came back and I asked him why I was not transfered to someone else, he said was looking for the phone number for the corporate office as I requested.  I told him I did not ask for any such information,  I asked why he was being so rude and if he did not want to help me he could have just transfered me to someone else.  He said to do that, I would have to hang up and call back.  I told him he was not being very he rude about this incident.  He said he was the best Rep they had there.  I beg to differ, left that call not getting any assistance.I had to call back to speak with another Customer Service rep, who was very helpful, looked up the information on my account and saw I owed no equipment, she made a notation on my past account and advised me to call the Equipment Department to let them know of that I was not liable for any information.  I did that.  Why couldn't it be that easy with my inital call, I wasted 30 mins of my life and had to make additional calls for information I should have received in the first place.
__label__1 I've been trying to give Comcast my money for service for three weeks. I had someone come out to enable the service, didn't even need them to hook up the connections because I'm very capable of that. The tech finds that the cable is not giving a signal and says a new cable has to be run and that they are not allowed to run cables in apartments. So I go to my apartment complex and ask them to do it, they say it is not their responsibility and that Comcast should do it and they gave me the apartments personal Comcast reps number. I call that rep and he says that the tech was supposed to set up an appointment for someone to come fix the "pre-line cable", not run a new cable. So now I'm on hold to set up an appointment for them to come fix that cable so I can get go set a different appointment for someone else to turn on the service which they don't technically need to do anything at my apartment at that point since I will already have everything hooked, but I still have to pay for them to come onsite because there has not been service here for 12 months. All of that was after I spoke with customer service three times before trying to get a direct answer to a very simple question which I finally got after speaking to the third person. Customer service is non existent!
__label__1 I called Comcast on December 15th to let them know that we were moving and to shut off our service on December 23rd. As usual the Comcast customer service agent that I talked to was not American and their command of the English language was not perfect. A couple of weeks later after moving I took their cable TV boxes back. Then I get a bill in the mail for service owing for January and more for February. So I call them back and I get the gal from India (or wherever) again, who tells me that they thought that I was moving my service to a new address. After going round and round with her, she had me wait on-hold for at least 20 minutes until a bona-fide American "account executive" could get on the line, who told me that I had never made a shut-off request, even though their non-native customer service agent had just told me that my shut-off request had been misinterpreted by them. So they refused to give me any credit for telling them to turn my service off until after the date that I turned their equipment back into them, claiming that I never told them to shut off my service. What obviously happened was that their foreign-based customer service worker misunderstood me, and Comcast's official response is that I should have called back to make sure that my first call was received accurately. So just so that we all know, either make at least a couple of follow-up calls to Comcast just to make sure your first calls weren't misunderstood by their second-rate foreign customer service workers or be ready to pay Comcast for extra service costs. Thanks but no thanks, Comcast. I won't be needing that run around ever again.
__label__1 I called Comcast customer service (disservice) to complain about the fact my service rate had been increased $20, $20 and $40 for the past three years. I was transferred to a manger. She said that she was sorry for that and she could put me on a new plan which would reduce my rate, but I would need to switch my receiver box with the new version. And that she would also send me a free camera for my front door as a bonus. I told her that I do not want a security package for I already have a security system in my house. She said that this is a single camera and not a security system, plus it's free. I said thanks. Few days later, I received a box containing the new receiver box and remote. I never received any camera. I called them and asked about the camera. The agent did not know what I was talking about! Later I noticed that I was being charged more than what I was told. Few phone calls later, I am told that the extra charges were because I have home security package. I told them that I never ordered a security package and I never received any equipment for it anyway. The agent said that he will cancel the security package from my bill even though it was 3 days over the 30 day cancellation period. I just received my new bill. Lo and behold there is $220 early termination fee for the security system package which I never ordered or received any parts for. So I called again. The agent never let me talk to a supervisor. She kept repeating that because I had ordered the package I have to pay the early termination charges. She even acknowledged that there was a note from a prior conversation which agent had told me that they would waive those charges. But, now it is due to a supervisor to "actually" waive or not waive those charges! This is the worst company I have ever had to deal with. I believe it is their company policy to trick customers into different packages without explaining everything that they have planned to extract more money from you. This is not the first time. A similar thing had happened to me with them many years ago. By the way, I have had Comcast for over ten years. They don't care. I am so disgusted with corporate culture in America. Is there not a government agency that can put a stop to this systematic highway robbery?
__label__1 I have been on the phone with customer service for 1 hr & 20 min. I am now waiting for account verification. This company is a disaster! I don't know how they survive. Because I live in an area where I cannot use AT&T or DirecTV I am forced to deal with this incompetence. I was quoted a promotion rate which I now learned was through a telemarketing firm. Since I had to reschedule my install, I thought I would call and confirm what I had been quoted. (I just don't trust them to do what they say they will do) Just as I expected a foreign speaking rep said she could not find the promotional rate so they had to rework and offer to mirror what I had been promised which was not nearly as good as the promotional rate (mind you I spent 45 min with the telemarketer). I think this is a deliberate bait and switch process because it has happened before with other Comcast situations. I have now been waiting for 3rd party verification another 20 min! Of course when I go through the verification process I was not offered the same as customer service promised! They tried to force me into a contract when I was told there would not be a contract. I have been going through this process for 3 hours and I still do not have a confirmed appointment!! This company is HORRIBLE, PAINFUL and FRUSTRATING! HONESTLY I WOULD RATHER FIND A STRAY BULLET THAN DEAL WITH THIS MADNESS. They could care less about customer service! I pray that technology will continue to advance so that Apple and other streaming vehicles develop technology so that companies like Comcast will be forced out of business and we will not have to deal with such a ** performance anymore!
__label__0 Comcast Rewards Triple Play offered me a $4.99 movie credit.  I was unable to download the form and mail it to Comcast, so I contacted their customer service department, and was told on the phone by the male representative that he would look into why I was unable to download the form, and send me an email.  I never received the email and now the form is no longer on the website.  I was told that the movie credit was offered to me as a bonus for the services that I receive at Comcast.    Please look into this matter for me and thank you in advance.
__label__1 Comcast is by far the WORST cable company in America. They have the WORST customer service, the highest rip off fees, horrible customer service and fraudulent termination fees. The service is UNRELIABLE and they enjoy ripping you off. DO not sign up with them unless you want to pay high fees and get stressed out when you have irregular or no service for days, and they could care less. They enjoy tormenting you while you pay these exorbitant fees. I now have FIOS and have no problems. Comcast can go to hell, it sucks!
__label__1 We just moved into our new house and are trying to get a fence put in but have not been able to do so due to Comcast's cable lines running through our backyard. The wires are all exposed and pose a hazard to my family and pets. There is only one line running to our house. The other 10-15 lines are from other surrounding homes and business lines that are not ours. I have been trying to get in contact with Comcast for over a month now to get what is called a "down barrier". I have called over 6 times and put in multiple "priority tickets", and even had the Comcast technician who installed our new equipment call. I have been told numerous times that I would receive a callback in 24 hours, 48 hours, that someone would be out in 72 hours and NO ONE has ever called back or showed up.One employee actually forged our signature and signed off and saying that the ticket had been taken care of which is why our first two tickets were honored. I have given them over a month's notice to try to get this fixed. The fence is being put in tomorrow and now that I have finally gotten Comcast's attention (and someone fired in the process) they are saying I will be charged if anything happens to their cable lines and that they cannot be out until April 28th due to all the companies they must contact. As if that is my problem! I cannot even fathom how HORRIBLE Comcast's customer service is. I have been a loyal customer for over 5 years and pay a great deal of money for their service every month. It is absolutely ridiculous that they cannot even get someone you back. How can a company that large have such terrible customer service? They are, by far, the worst company to deal with.
__label__1 Called last week to complain about slow Internet (downloads about 1-2Mbs according to Bandwidthplace.com. After IDing myself to their IVR system, I repeated the info to a rep, Told about my problem. Asked all kinds of questions about the modem and router. Said that it was their equipment so they should know all about it. She couldn't help so transferred me to their "Advanced" support. Repeated all the ID info and then was asked about the problem. Said that they would try to fix and call back in two days.Obviously, no help so I called back and they scheduled a tech to come on Sat PM. He arrived on time and checked signal strength and said the problem is in their system. Service drop is old and loss is above their standard. He would write a work order to run new service drop and increase signal strength. As you might expect, no improvement so I repeated everything early this PM and will see their service tech on Sat PM. By almost any standard Comcast is the absolute worst company in America. I just wish that the money being spent in DC to get the merger through was spent on improving infrastructure. We can only hope... 
__label__1 Customer Service, Canceled Account and Billing : I selected Comcast to handle my landline and my internet service. An appointment was selected and they came out during the appointment on March 8, 2012 and everything was fine. Until I woke up the next morning (March 9, 2012) to discover I did not have a landline dial tone, but I also did not have internet service. I contacted Comcast to find out what the problem was but found that they were unable to locate my account in the system. After approximately 15 minutes of searching, they located my account and determined the individual who installed my service did not "push" the order through and they would need to correct this matter. Within 90 minutes the internet was back up but the landline was not. I was told I would receive a phone call to confirm the landline was taken care of but that call never came. Just 45 minutes after the internet was restored, it went down again. I again contacted Comcast and the matter was "fixed," but they still could not locate the phone number and that matter would be looked into and I would receive a phone call. That phone call also never came. I decided to do business with another company and have the phone number ported over. After four days of the new company being unable to port the number over, I contacted Comcast and was transferred to four different individuals before I decided to cancel the entire thing and get a new phone number. I was told I would not receive a bill because I cancelled in less than 30 days. I was never instructed where or when the equipment needed to be returned, so I took it upon myself to do this. I received a bill reflecting a balance and when I called to inquire about the charges, I was told the bill was incorrect and that I in fact did not have a balance and a new bill would be sent out. On 3/24/12, I returned the modem and router to the Comcast store in Richmond, VA. On 4/3/12, I received a bill reflecting a credit but not for the entire amount. On 4/4/12, I began the tedious task of contacting Comcast to get the matter resolved. Beginning at 17:37 hours on 4/4/12, I was transferred to collections because Adrianna could not assist me. At 17:42 hours, I spoke with John who could not assist me but stated he would transfer me. I told John I did not want to be transferred again but wanted to speak with a supervisor. At 17:50 hours, I spoke with Matt who advised he could not help me. I disconnected the call and called back. I called back, held for 12 minutes waiting and was disconnected before I could even speak with a representative. I called back, held for 10 minutes 20 seconds and spoke with Sheila who advised me she could not assist me but would get me right over to someone. At 18:25 hours, I spoke with Larry who attempted to assist me but the call was disconnected. I called back and held for 25 minutes and 20 seconds and spoke with Jeremy at 19:02 hours who advised me that he could not help me and that I would need to physically go into a location with the receipt showing it has been returned and the account will be zeroed out. Jeremy advised Larry was mistaken when he said he could assist me over the phone and because they could not verify with their own eyes that the equipment had been returned they would not believe that it had been. When I pressed Jeremy for another solution, he advised it could be faxed but that it would take two or more days to get to him for it to be processed. I am left with no other choice but to go into the Comcast store to resolve this matter because I have a Jewish Holiday coming up and surgery and cannot wait the time period for the matter to be resolved before my account is submitted to collections and negatively impact my credit score. I am beyond upset with how disrespectful of my time Comcast has been. Customer service has not been helpful and only wants to transfer the call to someone else or advise previous information is incorrect. I do not believe what Comcast representatives advise and do not trust that this matter will actually be resolved.
__label__1 Comcast representatives lied about the total charges per month. After going over all equipment, fees, tiers of service, etc. I was guaranteed to keep all of my old channels and all of the same terminals and equipment including my dvr for a total of 135 dollars plus tax. 2 days after installation my channels changed and I had to call them to have it reinstated. Then we get a letter saying that we have not been charged for two terminals and our bill will be going up 16 dollars. After several calls then waiting for a supervisor to call back, all I get is there's no way anyone quoted me that price - although they won't check their recording to verify. I was careful to verify everything item by item and had her repeat everything included and the total price before taxes. They choose to call me a liar and wont check the recording that she guaranteed would be on file if there was any discrepancy. (I did this because they've lied prior.) Why can't they check the recording and honor the deal that they made. I'M IN FOR A LAWSUIT! SOMEBODY PLEASE STOP THE LIES TO SECURE OUR BUSINESS!
__label__1 Tech Support has been telling me that the problem is with my hardware, browser or settings. I explained to them that it doesn't matter whether I use my work laptop while I'm working or desktop at home or an iPad. The computers have different browsers. All cookies and cache have been cleared, so those excuses are invalid as are all the other ones they keep telling me. I explained that co-workers and people outside of my company are all having the same problem with their Comcast email but this info doesn't seem to make any difference.
__label__1 After writing the president of Comcast over a year ago, I was promised it would be fixed but that never happened. After writing several letters to the FCC, my local congressman, the state attorney's office and the viewer a consumer affairs, I've learned no one has control over this company regarding enforcement. After being extorted of money for over a year, the action above finally brought some results. Comcast shows arrogance and an unwillingness to resolve problems unless you take drastic action. This is truly a company OUT OF CONTROL and answers to no one.
__label__1 Last year a Comcast tech came out and installed a splitter on my cable. They told me that I wasnt getting a strong enough signal. Then when my cable stopped working, another Comcast tech came out and said they should not have put a splitter on my cable. The next month, I received a bill for a service call that is over $60.00 now because they keep putting a "surcharge" on my bill. I called to clear my account and they sent me another bill with another "surcharge" tacked on. Why don't they take responsibility for their screw-ups? I do for mine. Screwed by big corp.
__label__0    After some shopping aorund for a monthly TV service, I ordered Comcast Cable TV on October 20th, that is 20 days ago. When I ordered it I was told that it would all be set up the next day. When the installer came, he ran a cable into the house and informed me that the cable coming to my house from the underground box was damaged and they would have to run another. The work was promised to be completed within 3 to 5 business days later. They said they had to get a construction permit from the city to run another cable underground. I have been waiting since. I have had three installer show up at my door and bring me the converter box without me being informed and without any prior scheduling request or setu; they could not finish the work because they said an underground cable needs to be run. I was also called by five or six different individuals from Comcast telling me they are in charge of my "case" and they promise followup. I was told Comcast is still waiting for my city office to sign off on the permit they submitted weeks ago. I called my city office and found out that no permit has ever been submitted, my street is cabled for Comcast.  My city office also informed me that the permits for Comcast are usually signed off within a day or two. I keep calling Comcast three to four times a day and am not getting any callbacks or service.I have had three installer show up at my door and bring me the converter box without me being informed and without any prior scheduling request or setu; they could not finish the work because they said an underground cable needs to be run. I was also called by five or six different individuals from Comcast telling me they are in charge of my "case" and they promise followup. I was told Comcast is still waiting for my city office to sign off on the permit they submitted weeks ago. I called my city office and found out that no permit has ever been submitted, my street is cabled for Comcast.  My city office also informed me that the permits for Comcast are usually signed off within a day or two. I keep calling Comcast three to four times a day and am not getting any callbacks or service.
__label__1 My parents have had Comcast because they are comfortable and familiar with the channels. I started paying the bill for them about 3 years ago. Within that time they've raised the price 5 TIMES! Each time, I'll call and ask why the price went up. And each time, the customer rep tells me, "Oh, that's because you're paying the regular price now. Your special price just ended." So I tell them That's the same line you guys gave me 4 price hikes ago. And each time, they tell me, "Oh, that previous customer rep was lying." It's been a battle trying to get my parents to switch to another provider but we will be switching once I get back from my business trip. For everyone out there, all I can say is BUYER BEWARE! Bad company and very bad service. I was required to give them at least 1 star, but that's 1 star too many.
__label__5 Over the past year I have received the worse service from Comcast in the 10+ years I've been a loyal customer. The issue I originally called about has not yet been resolved because the rep either hangs up on me when they can't fix the problem or the rep just gives up and emails me information so I can read and fix myself. As soon as I can find a company that provides high-speed internet and cable TV I will take my business elsewhere.
__label__1 When calling Comcast (already have cable and Internet) they offered to bundle and offered phone service. They confirmed (I have a copy of the Internet chat with the Comcast rep to verify) that I would not lose phone service while they converted to comcast. My mother in law had a health emergency 12 days later and the phone was dead. I called comcast and could not get through to a person. Once I finally did, they would not connect me to a person that could help, despite me asking repeatedly asking for a manager. I had to drive my loved one on the hospital because 911 would not work. She arrived late and it has jeopardized her recovery. I am in the process of consulting with a lawyer from the Department of Justice. Comcast should be shut down.
__label__0 We returned our cable boxes back on May 5, 2010 and cancelled our service. We signed up with WOW. Comcast is still billing us and we have spent hours on the phone with their customer service, who promise that it will be corrected. It has not been corrected as of today 6/8/10--over a month. I can't stand this company and I am sick of talking to the slugnutty idiots in their customer service.
__label__1 Comcast customer service of the worst... they are lack of training information. I was told that I could easily move my service from one city to the next however I tried that and then still needed to run my social security number so each time you set up service they need to run your social security number. The Cable company ever.
__label__1 I have been paying $140 a month for a bundle service. The internet is supposed to be at 50 mbps. I run an average of 2-5 mbps since having the service. I don't have time to be dealing with this, but have still followed the technician's advice of changing out the modem and setting up an appointment for a visit. On the phone, Comcast claims that the only evidence of my internet not working is based on call logs of me calling in. The billing individual said that I was lying and that the problem pre-existed any phone calls I have made to Comcast. I tried explaining I don't have the time to deal with these problems... considering yesterday and today alone I have spent over 6 hours dealing with the problem that remains unresolved. The evidence I have been paying for service I don't receive lies in the fact I have to have someone come out here to troubleshoot a more fundamental problem with my service, not in the phone call log. All I ask is that I am reimbursed for services paid for but not received, but Comcast refuses. There are few choices in terms of switching service and I need internet for my work. There must exist a remedy for this problem.
__label__1 Comcast customer service is deplorable, complete with incompetent, rude and poorly-trained service reps. Instead of improving customer service to attract more customers, Comcast is now trying yet another dirty tactic to increase their revenues and make their customers even more dissatisfied and disgusted. There is no other company I can get ISP so I have no choice but to pay through the nose for Comcast's internet service which NEVER operates at the speed they claim.Last year I cancelled my cable TV service but continued with the internet service (since there is no other ISP in my area).Now, less than a year later, they've figured a new way to screw me - They just sent me a letter saying as of this month they are going to charge $10 per 50 GB of data I use over 300 GB per month. This is EXTORTIONATE! According to the new monitor they've installed, I already used 300 GB in the 1st week. So they offered me a way to avoid this $10 charge. I can pay them $30 a month more for unlimited data so now I'm paying $100 a month for just the internet. This is a 42% increase and I am at their mercy. I have filed a complaint with the FCC and I don't know what else to do. Aren't they violating some anti-trust laws? How is a monopoly allowed to operate? Why is this company still in business?
__label__0 Okay, let's begin! Back in January 2010, I moved here to East Orange, NJ! I originally wanted DirecTV (I love satellite), but found out that this building only allowed Sheisty cable to be installed because DirecTV only wanted their service and not cable to have any input here, thus making Comcast the contract winner. Not that I'm downing Comcast's service because I haven't had terrible service. Anyway, there was an offer that if I signed up for their triple play contract that I would receive a $200 gift card! Okay. Since I work for a cable company, I know how this goes. So I thought to myself, "Hmmm. Great. I'll do it." So I signed up. The terms clearly stipulated that this was a 24 month contract and that starting with month 13, my price would increase by I believe $20. I would need to fulfill the requirement to pay my bill on time every month for three months, 90days. I have done that!To skip all the in-between because I know that some of you fools like myself already have been through this, it is now November 2010 and I still do not have a gift card. I have escalated this to a corporate complaints level and I still do not have a gift card! I believe Comcast has breached their contract in falsely getting me to sign up for their service without ever making good on their offer. That is fraud! Because this is a contract, I am not able to change my level of service without incurring a fee! I would like from Comcast an inconvenience credit equal to one month's service credit. They have offered to credit my account, the $200. That was not listed as part of the terms of the contract when I signed up, that if they don't send a gift card, they will credit my account. Thus, they are trying to make it easier on themselves to just wash this under the rug and act like it never happened, by making such an offer. Do I have a leg to stand on? Or I ***? The woman from the corporate escalation group says that she has looked into it and she is being told that I will have to wait another 30 days. That is **** near an entire year that I will have waited. This other guy named Rick from corporate left me a voice mail message a few weeks ago and told me that the card should be in my mailbox by October 20th. That was a lie! I asked Debbie from the corporate escalations team to give me a month's credit for the inconvenience, due to what I feel is a breach of contract. She told me let's wait until we get the gift card to you. And then they can review if my request has any merit. I think she is lying because they have no intentions of issuing a gift card! What do I do?
__label__1 Why does it take five appointments and a dozen calls to get service? I have had comcast for many years but they contract with untrustworthy technicians. On this day I have been waiting and given a third time for which I can expect the tech to come to my home. I haven't even taken into consideration all the snow we had had in Boston but everywhere I look I see XFINITY trucks but they will not come to my house. I had one lie and said he came but nobody answered the door. Fresh snow had been falling all morning and there were no tracks indicating that someone had been to the house but this is acceptable!So far to date I have been given $120 in credits for NO SHOW TECHS! Today as I sit here waiting since 7:30 am for my scheduled appointment slot of 8 - 10, 11 - 12 and this last time 1 - 1:30 the rep guaranteed me I would get installation today! I have spent countless hour waiting on tech to install my cable, phone and Internet. If there were a better cable supplier I would go with them but I heard horror stories about Directv, RCN and Verizon.
__label__1 Worst company in the entire world, if you can avoid getting Comcast, do it. They have a data cap on their internet which limits you to 300GB. They say it's enough to stream a ton of movies/shows, but it isn't, especially not with more than 1 person using the internet in a house. I have to day in and day out make sure that I'm not streaming too many shows on Netflix, or Hulu, or watching too many YouTube videos because if I so much as go over 1 GB of data, I will be charged $10. Don't get me started on their customer services, they don't exist. All customer service is outsourced to India and none of them know anything about what you want and none of them care to help you out in the least. NEVER GET COMCAST.

__label__1 Well on September 1, 2011, I ordered Comcast cable. Only supposed to be for 2 months as I told the sales representative. He said, "oh well, if you join your internet service and TV it will only cost an additional 29.99 a month". I said, "Ok, cool. Can I get it overnight?". He said, "no problem". I told him Friday I have work at noon. He said, "That's no problem. It will be there around 9:30am to 11:00am". Ok, I said. Friday came and left. No phone call like I asked when they get to my residence since it's gated. So Saturday, I called to see what had happened. Well the guy in Mexico assured me that a UPS guy tried to get in contact. That they were at my residence, knocked on my door and no one answered. I said ** because I was there and they can't get in. So I asked for the package number to track. He read it to me, I read it back to verify it's right. I said thanks and hang up. I called UPS to my surprise, there is no product number or no package scheduled to be delivered. So I called back another person from Mexico, this one's a lady. So I explained and she said it was returned to Comcast and it was never attempted to be delivered to my residence. So I said, since you failed you can fix this, take off the 25.00 overnight charge and have someone deliver it to me. I cannot do that, I can do another overnight shipping but it won't come until Tuesday since Monday is a holiday. I will also give you a blast on your internet for three months free she said. Cool, I said. So Tuesday came. I checked emails and I have three hundred dollar bill from Sep. 1st to the 3rd. ** is this? I called Comcast again and same old runaround. After the third person, I came to find out a few things.5. They actually had the balls to say "we'll see if we can take this off". I lost it after that. Lying, thieves, no principles at all.
__label__1 Been dealing with a nightmare at Comcast for at least 3 years now. I pay $90 a month for high-speed internet and receive half the speed I pay for. I have to keep calling there for them to turn my internet speed up. Then my service works good for a few days and it's right back down again. I've been through modems, wireless internet boxes, and still nothing but problems. They are no doubt in my mind throttling back on internet service.
__label__1 Endless time on hold. Pass from one operator to the next. D1 DVR constantly needs rebooting. No info on outage. Basically COMCAST SHOULD BE DISMANTLED.
__label__0 
__label__1 They ignored first amendment rights and ignored dispute letter for over-charging and making false charges for services not provided. Internet is for $29.99 or $10; cable, for $65.54 or $75.  However, Comcast wants $300 a month for services that were not given or started. This is fraud on the account.
__label__1 I had an appointment for this past Tuesday. The "technician" drove down the street, turned around and didn't stop. When I called, I was told that nobody was home. I rescheduled for today. The Tech showed up, switched out the boxes (again) and told me to wait a few minutes for the "On Demand" service to work. I was told to call him if it didn't work after a few minutes. I called twice, no answer and left a message. No return call. I just got off the phone (again) with a Comcast rep. and was told someone might be out before 8 tonight or first thing in the morning. It's pitiful and expensive service and I guess I will have to cancel service with them and go with another company.
__label__1 I'm really tired of trying to watch Comcast tv shows. Most channels experience regular "stuttering" of picture and sound. Today, I was watching CNN's coverage of the Pope's visit, and Wolf Blitzer sounded like he was speaking Klingon! This is typical of Comcast reception.
__label__1 When I called to establish service they had to call me back. Their "system" was too slow to tell me if I was in their area. I then spent 30 minutes going through their options and establishing service. I received a call the next day and was told that even though I had set up a installation date and established service with them they could not come out and connect service on the first of the month because there was already service at the house. Until that was cancelled they could not install mine. I have moved numerous times and I have never heard this before. The representative was unwilling to try to explain the issue in a way that made any sense and would not let me speak to a manager. In the end, I told him that I did not want service through Xfinity and would find another provider.
__label__1 For the past four months, Comcast has raised my bill even when I cut back to basic cable and they look for other things they can charge me and my bill is suppose to be $47.95 and they're still overcharging me $61.16. They said in a letter that after this bill, my payments will be $64.90. As a disabled person, I am not able to afford such. They continue to keep raising prices and need to stop.
__label__0 On June 5, 2010, I was surprised with an increase of my bill from $66.00 bundle package to $104.94. Comcast did not notify me ahead of time for this increase. A month ago, when I went to pay for my bill at Comcast-Hayward, I asked a staff in that office for any promotions. The staff told me that he will give me 12 months of premium channel for $9.99 and continue the $66.00 bundle package for another 12 months. When I received my bill, I was surprised that my bill was for $164.99. When I called Comcast, I was subjected to talk to different representatives about it. Comcast refused to honor what this company originally offered me. After I hung up the phone, my internet service got disconnected and I had to make more calls to question my internet service. I spent my whole day trying to resolve the billing issues and technical difficulties that I continue to experience. Today, June 7, 2010, I turned on my television set and I found that Comcast also disconnected my cable service. I had to call again to find out about my cable service. A technician by the name of Karen, had told me that someone disconnected my service. She has to turn on my service. I was on the phone waiting for half an hour to get a cable service again. It appears that Comcast had been playing with my services by someone turning it on and off.I've missed my 11:00pm show because I had to spend half an hour to get a technician on the line. Only to tell me that she is sorry, she will turn the cable service on. How can you get Comcast to do fair business practices? How can I stop Comcast staff to play with my cable and internet services. 
__label__1 The wifi signal is really really bad.
__label__1 Be prepared for a complicated, detailed and possibly faulty sign-up process. We encountered a rude agent, then failure to get phone number and equipment delivery. Had to go through "reprocessing." Hoping try no. 2 works.
__label__5 3 years now, number of receivers, WiFi routers, modems it's always the same result. Sometimes they work mediocre and sometime not all. What do you do? THROW more money down the drain with calling their service man or drive over to their office and get more of their faulty products. Bent over the barrel is right! I can't wait for dsl. Maybe their service will be faster than dial up????
__label__1 This might be my second or third negative review. My broadband speed decreased markedly; even the customer service representative on the phone was surprised. She talked me into a better deal with faster download speeds, but also scheduled a home visit by a technician, with the usual provision that if some marked decrease in speed was my fault, I would have to pay for the visit. The technician discovered that a splitter - installed not by me but by another Comcast technician years ago - as well as some recalibration had resulted in the decrease in speed. He fixed the problem. And, of course, Comcast charged me for the visit. When I called to complain, rather than remove the charge, Comcast issued me a credit that won't appear on my bill for another 4-6 weeks. Good thing I stopped their automatic payments.I find Comcast to be one of the most dishonest companies I have ever had the misfortune with which to deal. Twice in the past ten years someone - not me! - has "ordered" cable TV at my house (and I live alone without a television set). If there were an alternative service, I would get it. If free market competition is not viable to this increasingly necessary service, then I wish the state or federal government would take it over; Comcast is just corrupt.
__label__0 I made a past due payment of $203 on my acct. on April 4th; Comcast EFT from my checking acct. on April 6th. I went to the office and I was told I needed to talk to my bank. I called the bank and a manager tried to help me on a 3-way call. I was told it would be 24-48 hrs for my money to be refunded. When I didn't receive the money or a call from Comcast, I called them again and was told it would take 10 business days for someone to contact me about my refund. I waited and still there was no call. I called them on 4/14/09 and was told that there was a note on my acct. stating if I called back, they were to tell me that I wouldn't receive my $431 back and there was a credit on my acct. for $203 to past due balance. I paid and someone would be in contact with me. I think they are trying to wait me out so that they can use the credit on my acct. for the next billing cycle. Can you please help me?
__label__1 Up until a couple weeks ago I was happy with my Comcast cable service. I like to record almost everything I watch on my DVR to watch at my convenience, and I like to browse the TV schedule and program my DVR on the Comcast website with my laptop. Their website worked very well for that. A while back they introduced a new website and encouraged customers to try it out with popups on the old website. I tried it and found it terrible, all style over substance with none of the functionality of the old website. Several times I gave feedback which they had requested which was very negative, and expressed to a couple customer service people that I hoped they wouldn't do away with the old website, and was told not to worry, that they wouldn't do that.Then a couple weeks ago, my bookmark for the old website took me to the new one. I called customer service and they acted like they didn't know what I was talking about. So I went to Comcast's online customer forums, and there were many complaints there similar to mine. The channel guide on the old site had a 5 hour grid, and the new one only showed 2 hours. The old guide had filters for My Channels and My Favorite Channels, but the new one didn't, so you had to scroll through almost 1000 channels, most of which aren't in my subscription. The old guide had designations for "new" shows visible in the guide, and the new one you have to click on each program to find out if it was new. It was virtually unusable for the way I had been using it.The forum thread complaining about the new website is now up to more than 30 pages, with minimum response from Comcast. They tell us to use the App, but I don't have or want a smart phone, and I can't afford one anyway with what I pay Comcast for cable service. They also make vague promises about improving the new site according to customer feedback, but many people on the forum gave them negative feedback when the new site first came out as I did, and no improvements have been made yet. We have asked them to let us use the old site until the new one can be improved, but Comcast has no response. Comcast has a monopoly on cable where I am, and I feel I am paying the same price and getting much reduced service for how I use it. It is much more difficult and time consuming to program my DVR now, and many other people feel the same way.
__label__0 I have been subjected to inconsistent billing and communication about my charges for the past six months. I have been forced to call into Comcast customer service multiple times to rectify the errors, which somehow appear again. Each time, I am promised a new package, and a worry-free future, but it only lasts a month until I see my next bill.Sample this: I have been put in four different packages upon recommendation of your customer service reps, each time I have not been told about terms of the contract or package exclusions. I was even awarded a $50 credit for miscommunication by one of your reps, which never showed up, and I find out it did not because I was not entitled to it.Is this how you treat your valuable customers? Five years and I am not counting anymore. I am switching out of a majority of your services because I have tried in good faith for the past six months to be a loyal customer. It doesn't work like that with Comcast. So here I am, I complain for one last time. I expect no response, but I do hope you fix the number of bundles and conditions you place on customers with unclear transition points between each and varying contractual obligations. It is a maze that nobody can possibly solve.Some of your reps are polite, but the last one I spoke to was rude, cocky and even careless about my account history. Adieu Comcast, mostly, because you still have a monopoly on TV in my area. 
__label__0 My internet went down about two months ago. Comcast had 6 different technicians come out to fix the problem. I lost 1 month of internet access and probably 24 hours of my life on hold with Comcast. Almost, every time a tech would come out, they would replace my modem and leave. A couple hours later, the internet would go out again. I'd call Comcast back, be hold for hours, and wait 10 days for another tech to show up whenever he felt like it. Finally, Comcast decided that the problem was not my modem (after they changed it 3 times). The problem was at the pole at the front of the neighborhood. Comcast has aggravated everyone in the neighborhood, because we all had the same problem. And because of Comcast's incompetence, it took them 1 month to figure it out. I canceled Comcast, returned my equipment, and again, requested my modem back at the Orange Park branch. The lady was very rude to me and told me I must have a receipt for the modem I purchased years ago. You can see that there is a modem on my account that is not Comcast's. Apparently, that was not proof enough that I owned a modem. To top it off, I received a notice today that Comcast was sending a collector after me for one of their modems. No doubt, one of the three that the tech's switched out. Wow, Comcast has so much nerve. They are fraudulently charging me for not returning their modem, while they have also stolen my mine. 
__label__1 I negotiated a new contract with Comcast cable because my 99 plan became close to $200 over a period of a year. For the third time they will tell you that I was on a special that I never signed up for. When I called to cancel Comcast cable the supervisor came on the phone to convince me Tuesday they will give me a $99 plan for 2 years and my bill will not go up. I agreed. I received after one year of being in a two year contract bills with taxes $119 only lasted a couple of months. I notice my bill went up three more dollars. So I was paying $122.00. By the time I could call them in the next two days I received a bill stating that I owe 124.00 next month. While talking to an agent she stated that they are allowed to raise my bill while being in a two year contract. He referred me to the next person who told me I did not have a contract. Who referred me to a lead person who told me that I was in a contract but they are not raising the price on my cable deal but they are raising the price on my modem? So my bill will not be $124 it will go up to 126 because they are charging an extra $2 on the modem. I am trying to figure out how my $99 plans went up to a hundred and twenty six dollars on a $2 modem increase. Looks like I am back on my way to a 200 dollar phone bill with my $99 2 year contract plan.
__label__1 As many of us have noted, there's suddenly a brand new "fee" on my Comcast bill. In addition to a .50 cent increase for my TV cable package, and a $3.00 increase in my Internet charge, now there's a NEW "Broadcast TV Fee" of $1.50-so I'm now paying $5.00 more a month for???? Isn't there some sort of Regulatory Agency that's supposed to oversee this? We have no other choice where I live if we want cable so if that's not a Monopoly, what is? I'm totally disgusted by Comcast and their "rip-off customers at every opportunity" policy.
__label__0 Every afternoon, Comcast high-speed internet slows to a crawl. There are always problems with email. Is there anyone who knows of a better alternative?
__label__1 I requested two HD receiver and Comcast doesn't guarantee that they have an HD receivers with HDMI, actually the operator says that is a randomly process. That mean that if I receive an HD receiver, I'll be a very lucky customer. Does anyone inside Comcast explain to all employees (technical support included) what HD means and the differences between all the formats and receivers. Must be helpful have a some good customer service if you pay $120 monthly, don't you think?I really will try to get a big complain about Comcast services and how they try all customers. Actually I'm going to get a new service provider. Actually Comcast is getting all our money doing charges for HD channel that a lot of people are paying and they didn't receive this service. I spend time in a local office and they are providing receivers that doesnt have any port that will show an full HD signal to a TV, the worst part is that Comcast employee don't say the truth about it and customer think that they get an HD receiver. It must be stop and comcast should be explained that thing and why in NTSC or SD signal the compression show a low quality of signal and sometimes looks like TV channel are having problems like lipsync or pixelation.The best thing about the company are the ads.
__label__0 Comcast high speed internet.  Outlook email, unable to receive messages - error message 0x800CCC92.  (I can still send through Outlook, but I have to use Comcast web mail to receive my emails.)  Comcast tech support checked my settings then told me they do not support Outlook and that it must be a Microsoft problem.  Microsoft support shows this error happens when the ISP has not updated their Exchange Server.  So they are both blaming each other, and I still cannot receive email through Outlook.Very timeconsuming to use web mail and at the same time not have easy access to Outlook folders.
__label__1 Comcast lost all of my sent items in my husband's sent box in Xfinity/SmartZone. The technician in the Philippines was not able to find them. Upon escalating the issue it turns out this is a WELL-KNOWN issue in the escalation department and they do not seem to be able to figure out what is happening. Last week we could not send e-mails as the port number changed for no reason. That is the least of our problems now. Technicians said escalation would call us sometime tomorrow between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. expecting me to stay home all day and wait for them to call. They will only make one call. I was finally able to get him to use a call back time frame of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. for an escalation dept. phone call regarding finding my e-mails. We need an e-mail server we can trust as we are required to use our own e-mail for communication with employers. We need to verify that we communicated with them. Our e-mail setting was set to save to server assuming we could trust the server.
__label__5 I was a customer with Comcast. They lied about the discount. Was suppose to have someone do the work so I could get internet service, but he didn't do the work. So, they had to send a tech over after I waited for service for four days. They said there would be no charge for the tech coming out since it was their fault that my service was not ready. Wrong! They charged me for everything. They gave me a discount for 12 months then automatically signed me up for the next year without my consent. The bill was getting higher and higher so I called them. The customer service person told me that the discount they gave me for the past twelve months was added to my bill and each month they charged extra until it was paid. How can these people get away with this? It is as though no one can stop these crooks from their crooked business dealings. I need an internet service. All of them are liars and crooks!!!
__label__1 I went in to close an old bank account I had and were not using, and found out that a year ago COMCAST made a withdrawal of nearly $500 from it. I called Comcast and they give me the runaround eventually explaining that they basically don't care where the money comes from and I should take it up with my bank. Bank will not investigate since I closed the account and it's past 60 days from the transaction (time limit for fraudulent transactions). Seriously, both parties smoothly wash their hands away from this? I am absolutely sure Comcast can track down the payment based on my bank account number, day and amount of the payment, but they had no interest in doing so. Instead, they kept asking for an account number I had ten years ago and used to pay with the bank account that now got ripped off. They got money so they're happy and arrogant. So basically anyone who has your bank account can call Comcast and pay with your money. If you won't notice in 60 days you're screwed since no one cares. Watch out friends.
__label__1 I have their 105mb Blast internet and the 60 channel line-up plus HBO and Streampix. I have been having nothing but problems with inconsistent internet speeds and I lost 6 channels that I was supposed to have because they didn't want to correct their error. Instead when I proved to them that I was supposed to have these channels they changed what my line-up showed as on my account overview. Now, just to state this...I actually did not originally want TV through them. I had just the 105mb internet but when I sent in for a new router/modem they sent me a cable box along with it. I called, they gave me some deductions for their error and then offered me the deal I currently have. They told me it would be $89/month. Well, my first bill after the deductions they pushed through was $50. My second bill is now $137. Basically they are making me pay for the deductions. This company has done nothing but rip people off for years. Oh but on top of all of the mistakes they have made and the horrible billing...I have had to deal with some people through tech support that didn't even know what they were talking about along with others who were pure attitude and even swore over the phone. I am NOT happy with their service, I am NOT happy with their employees and I am NOT happy about their billing. If I could cancel without ensuing terrible fees or at least downgrade back to my standard internet I would. I am even getting charged for the old router/modem when I sent it back! I am nothing but perturbed!
__label__1 On Saturday 4, 2014 I had an appointment with Comcast cable and internet to get my old service install in my new house. The appointment was scheduled for 5-7 pm. The technician arrived at 6:35 and decide that was too much work for him and called probably fake supervisor who authorize him to come next day, Sunday 5 between 8-10 am. At 9:35 am Sunday I called to ask about my service and after a long time waiting for someone to pick up the phone they told me that there was no service requested for me. I told the lady on the phone what had happened the day before and she said that she was going to do something to help me. After multiple call disconnections and all possible excuses and attitudes at (8 something already pm) I spoke to another supervisor and told me that they had no solution for my problem and the department was already closed and there was nothing he could do for me.Today, Monday 6 - I am still without service and have not hope to get a better service. I feel frustrated, disappointed and angry. I hope someone finds the employee number of this person who was at home and called a "supervisor" to come next day and do the work. I hope someone finds the "supervisor" who promised me to send someone next day and never did, and someone able to improve the customer service of this company that is absolutely not customer friendly.
__label__1 I wanted to get internet service from Comcast cable services. I checked myself the availability of the Comcast service at my address and got the answer online that the service is available. So the next day, I called on the number 877-417-0922. My call was, after some time, answered by a person who called himself Kenneth. After taking all my information, he told me that I will get internet service at $29.99 and a free router and modem. Then he said, "you will pay for the two said devices and you will get the paid amount back as a rebate". After this, he said "you will have to pay for the shipment $19.99". Then he said, "you will not get the shipment amount back". The total amount he made was $199.93. He took all my credit card information. There was not enough amount in my bank so I offered him another card and told him to get the total amount from the two cards. He told me that I will pay double shipment if I have to use two cards for payment. I did not want that so I rushed and deposited some cash in the bank to make the payment from one card. After making the payment, he started offering me more of his offers from AT&T security and tried to connect me to the AT&T security people. I told him that I have been on the phone for about two hours and I was late for my job, I will do that tomorrow. So then he connected me to the installation department to setup the date for installation. The man who talked to me from the installation department called himself Steve, told me that my computer shows that Comcast service is not available at my address. After too much discussion, he told me that I should cancel my order from the sales department. So I called back to the sales department and found on the phone a person called William. William told me that the installation department people may be confused and that we have the service in that area and connected me back to installation department. This time, I found another person called Espo. Espo said there is no service at my address. I tried to reach Kenneth, the first person whom I had talked and who had taken all my credit card information to cancel the deal, but I could not get to him. When I reached for my job, I was two hours late. At my job, my cell phone started ringing. I had told Kenneth that I am unable to pick any call when at my job. I tried to call back, but nobody picked my call. The next day, I got a message from my cell phone company that I have used all my minutes and I need to refill my account. The next day, I called the number 877-405-5035 and talked to a lady whose name was either Rem or Allisan. She told me that I still can get the rebate. She told me to fill the forms online and send it for rebate. The form for rebate was asking for the date of installation, but I haven't been given the date of installation by the Comcast people because they are not going to install the service to me. There is much more to say because I have talked to some other people in Comcast. Please do not do this. Please be truthful.
__label__5 I have been a customer of Comcast Business Class for about 10 years. Currently I pay $125/month for service with static IP addresses. I have been extremely happy with the service up until about October 2013. The service became very slow from 20Mb/s down to 1Mb/s (upload was 5Mb/s to 0.2Mb/s). I am constantly resetting their cable modem to get a temporary fix. Comcast replaced the modem but the condition still persists. A call today to Comcast resulted in a sales pitch. They suggested that for another $15/month I could get 50Mb/s download and 10Mb/s upload. I just want what I used to get. It appears that they have oversold bandwidth and are rationing services, or they are purposely causing the problem in order to sell customers into higher priced plans.
__label__1 I have had Comcast for 3 years and somehow I got signed into a 2 year agreement when I was told it would be 1 year. Ever since I have added internet and phone, this bill has been out of control. Not to mention that they bill you a month in advance for services you haven't used yet. I can't get any help on why there is an additional $142.00 on my bill monthly nor can I get help lowering it. Very unhappy.
__label__1 I was a Comcast customer for over 10 years and was never thoroughly impressed with their service in general. (If that seems like it was too long to not enjoy, consider that all cable/satellite providers have bad referrals.) When I moved to Charlotte, NC I had to switch to another provider because Comcast is not available in the area. I was asked to provide proof that I was relocating for work to terminate my contract without the penalty. I personally went to the Comcast service center and provided that proof. A Comcast representative assured me that they would waive the early termination fee and even showed me the $0 early termination line on my account. 1 month later I received a bill from Comcast with a $518 early termination fee. I assumed it was a mistake and called Comcast. To my disbelief, they retracted the waived fee and acted like it was a policy to screw 10+ year loyal customers. I will never do business with them again and swear to spread this story to as many people as possible. On the bright side, it was charged to a credit card that I will challenge the charge and Comcast will never see another penny of mine. I hope this changes at least one persons mind if they ever consider Comcast vs any other provider. WORST SERVICE IN THE INDUSTRY (or any industry at all)!!!
__label__1 I used Comcast internet connection + their modem with 12mb/second until August 2015, no T.V for $55.59 tax included. In October 2015, I had Comcast on the phone, good news! According to them, for the same amount, they upgraded me to 75mb/s + T.V, which I accepted. In fact, their internet speed had never reach 75mb/s, the maximum was 43mb/s! The first surprise was the bill received in October 2015, $69.95 and no more $55.59. After 6 calls because they hang up the phone, Comcast gave me their claim ticket number and assured me that the price without the TV was $41.74 tax included (I did not receive yet their box for the TV). Comcast assured me that the next bill with the T.V will be $55.59.Surprisingly, the bill in November, has jumped to $176.46!! So I called Comcast again, this time I asked them to take back their TV, erased the bill and charged me as it used to be until August, that what Comcast did. As soon as they have disconnected the TV, my have lost the connection every 5 minutes because they have lowered the speed to only 3mb/s. I have never seen a horrible company like this before...
__label__1 Here is my complaint directly to the xfinity rep, it should speak for itself: I've got a real big problem with xfinity right now. Here's the deal, we have been renting this router from you guys. The wireless broke on it so we called in to get it replaced. It was never replaced, the people didn't come out and fix it or replace it. You charged me for the replacement. I called back and told them that it was never replaced. Got that so far? Ok, here's the problem: now that we've cancelled our ** service with you **, I took my router back to the Comcast store and they told me that we now have 2 pieces of equipment on our account. And they wont take it back until we get the other router (THAT WAS NEVER GIVEN TO US) back to them. Listen, theres only one way you can fix this: take that extra ** off our account.
__label__1 I am so frustrated with Comcast. I had business service and had to close my business. When I called Comcast to cancel, I was informed that the early disconnect penalty would be over $1000.00 because I was in a three year contract. Small business fail every day... So why would Comcast require a 3 year contract with such a massive penalty? So I called back 9 times - put on hold for extremely long periods of time trying to get some options. I was given a business rep's name for the Dallas area and she hung up on me when I explained my situation. I called back and left three messages and she never called back. Finally, after paying the bill for 4 months with no service, a customer service rep advised me to transfer the business account to my residence... Which I had to add Internet and pay double the price... I agreed to do that. I still have to add cable separately because business service in your home does not uncle cable (another additional cost). I finally got the service installed (Internet and phone) after a missed appointment that I took off work for. Now that the phone is installed, I disconnected the residential phone. I have NO phone service throughout the home, only in one room. I called Comcast and was told that business service only works on one phone. What?!? Seriously?? Why would the rep suggest transferring service if I could only have service in one room? Why wasn't I informed of that? Now I have no monitoring for my security system. Again, Comcast provided no options! I cannot believe this company survives with the way they treat their customers. As soon as this contract is up, I am canceling!
__label__1 I have never seen such a horrible service like Xfinity. Wish we have TWC or Verizon in my place. I am sharing some of my experiences below: Last week by mistake I clicked the upgrade modem link. I already have a docsis 3.0 modem, so I called the customer support and asked them to cancel the order. They said they took care of it. After 5 days I got the equipment from Comcast. Now I called them and after 30 minutes service desk told me to return it asap. Now I need to find a center and return it. For last few days, I am seeing tv service has been added to my account. I called customer care and told them I don't need TV service, cancel it. They said TV service not added to my account and no clue why it got added to my account. She said my plan is unchanged but I am not sure if Comcast will charge anything extra. After interacting to Xfinity customer care, it seems some time they are not aware of the things or mislead you.
__label__0    Comcast has the most confusing printed bills in the world for a reason. Money.After returning their boxes, turning off their internet and going to basic service they were still charging me for full service. I called them. I was told that Comast bills a month in advance but I would have these charges removed from my bill next month but I had to pay even though it was the wromg amount. So tell me how much my bill will be monthly. I was told $67.15. I asked repeatly how much will my monthly bill be after I paid this hugh bill. $67.15 per month. Okay I even took this guys employee number down ( which was made up)For 3 months I sent $67.15 per month. This is the amount Comcast told me to pay. Now they have cut my service off and turned me over to collections because my monthly payments are actually $87.50. Now all these short payments have piled into $300.00. I fought over an hour with a supervisor last night explaining again and again that I paid the amount Comcast said I owed. Over and over I asked him why he didn't pull the taped conversation I had when I was told to pay $67.15. He was sorry for the miscommunication but pay up or else be cut off. I'm on a fixed income. I made the original call to them to stop them from charging me for what I didnt have and to find out what my monthly bill was going to be after all my service cut backs. $67.15 is what they told me and thats what I've been paying. This is their fault not mine but they will not take responsibility. They want the money and thats it. 
__label__0 About 6 months ago, I started noticing that my internet service would slow or stop. At that point, I called and they told me that the modem needed to be reset and i could do this by unplugging the modem and waiting 10 seconds. That would work, but only temporarily. More recently, while I've been trying to watch movies via Netflix on my computer, the connection would either slow considerably or stop completely. I called again and the operator said my connection wasn't being recognized. To fix that, she suggested I unplug the modem and disconnect the cable for about 30 seconds. That works, again temporarily. This has been happening at least 3 times every time I'm trying to use the computer, regardless of what task I'm trying to do.
__label__1 WARNING: COMCAST BUSINESS and COMCAST RESIDENTIAL are similar to discussions with the U.S. and Afghanistan. Different languages, different leaders, different goals and expectations. I live in a high rise building. My office was on the 2nd floor and my residence on the 66th floor. The building recently converted to Comcast and the nightmare began. Currently Comcast -called me- to upgrade my service to X1. I informed them that this is an older building but Comcast just re-wired it.Numerous phone calls, emails, and promises resulted in my phone lines being disconnected and no new service. Business customer service at Comcast stops at 5PM Friday and restarts at 6AM on Monday. My lines went dead at 4:30 PM CST on a Friday. My good fortune was to reach someone, after an 18 minute hold, and request reinstatement of the phone service. It took over 2 hours.I have been in constant contact with the office of Tom Karinshak. "We value your feedback. Please know that we are actively investigating your concern. A representative from Tom Karinshak's office will contact you within one business day." This is the auto responder. Since that time I have a dozen reps that offer assistance but have delivered nothing. I have, to date, 152 responses.On Tuesday, May 26 a rep from Comcast came to my residence. He informed me that X1 would not work in this unit. He called Comcast and informed them of the situation. I personally talked to Comcast Executive Office in Oakbrook and we all agreed to stop the installation order paperwork and leave ALL services alone. Today, May 31 all my phones are disconnected. Because it is Sunday I can't get them turned back on till Monday. This is the second time in one month that Comcast Business and Comcast Residential can't communicate. With over 23 hours of my personal time, dozens of reps, hundreds of emails, not one person has offered any compensation or adjustments. No one person took total ownership of the responsibilities to resolve these issues. No one person has been able to bridge the gap between Comcast Business and Comcast Residential.Bottom line it has been over a year since Comcast took over the building. My total bills are in excess of $350 per month for internet, phone, and cable services. I am so frustrated and angry I have listed my home for sale. I have lived here since 1985 and the continual escalation of the 'lifeline' of communication leaves me with no other choice. AT&T does not want to service analog phone lines. AT&T and DIRECTV are not choices in a building controlled by Comcast wiring, etc. Comcast, in my opinion ranks as one of the worst customer concentric organizations I have experienced in my life.If you have a choice between providers Comcast should be your last alternative. Here's the response from the business rep that asked me to call him back on Monday, May 18. "Sorry I cannot call you, I am on inbound calls today. The number 8553366983 is the correct number if you're moving business to business and setting up services. But if it's residential to business, you'll need to get a hold of the residential side to find out their number to cancel any further porting on the telephone end." I am spending too much of my time on this matter. This is total disregard for me as a customer.
