__label__1 I've been a Comcast Customer for over 8 years. Recently Comcast raised my monthly service to over $200 per month. I called to cancel in May and was sent to the "recovery" department. I was offered a deal so I would stay. A month later I called to cancel my service once more, as I was not completely satisfied with what I was offered. I was transferred to the "recovery" department again where I was given, what I can see today as, a "too good to be true" deal. The individual offered to lower my monthly to around $160 per month total and would increase my internet to 50mbps, plus phone. I really did not need the phone as I have a cellphone plan but the internet MBPS increase got my attention. And he promised that this rate will not increase for 2 years, and that I could cancel if not satisfied.I was in the middle of traveling for work so I decided to try it. He said I had to listen and accept something over the phone and then I would receive an email, so I did. This month my bill was $200 again and I could not believe it! I was very upset, so I called to cancel my service for cable but decided that I would keep my internet. I was told that I could cancel but because I am into a 2 year agreement I would have to pay $250 cancellation fee. I was speechless to say the least. I explained that I never signed anything to what I was asked if I had to go thru a phone acceptance. To make the story short, I was tricked into a 2 year contract I guess because I called so many times to cancel, that whoever I talked to decided to lock me in so I would not be able to call to cancel again.After trying to make them understand that I was tricked into this and what I was told, I finally gave up due to the Comcast representative lack of interest in resolving the issue. I feel so betrayed by the company I have given my loyalty and business for so long that I decided to cancel anyway and take the $250 hit. Unfortunately I need my internet and the only other ISP is not the best. So I told him I needed to keep my internet. I got hit a second time by Comcast telling me that because I am cancelling an agreement, the only internet plan I can get is 105 mbps for a cost of $114 plus fees and taxes. WOW! All I need is a maximum of 25 mbps but I cannot even get that from Comcast after I pay them the $250 unfair fee. This company has changed a lot! I remember when they used to care about their Customers. Now they treat you well ONLY when you do not have a contract and when you do not call to complaint. The strength of a company that provides a service and/or a product is on their Customer service department. It is how well and effective they can resolve Customer situations, so you can keep your Customers. After searching the internet looking for answers, I just found out that Comcast is at the top of the list but for worst Customer service! I can see that... I guess Comcast has become so big and "business" like that people have just become a $ money icon for them. They do not care anymore... It looks like they do not mind the turn over as new Customers keep signing up every day now.
__label__1 Unfortunately, my landscaper cut my cable when planting in the backyard. I called Comcast to schedule repairs and was told that it would be addressed the following day. I took off work to be present, and waited all day - no one showed up. When I called Comcast to check on the appointment, I was told I was the last call of the day. Again, waited, but no one showed up. I called the next day to ask what happened, and was told I was on the schedule for that day. I waited and guess what - no one showed up. I made multiple calls throughout that day to check on the schedule, and got the same lines and routine by each representative. They have a script, and they read the script. They tell you what you want to hear, even though it is a blatant lie.I finally spoke to a supervisor, and he was worse that all of the agents. He had no better process or solution to the problem - very sad, sad customer service. They have no idea how to solve a problem. They have broken processes which are meaningless and worse yet, I don't think they care!! In the meantime, I'm still without service and wondering if I should just switch to AT&T. If I could rate them "zero" stars, I would.
__label__1 I got Comcast July 2015, it is now March 2016, the service is being spotty. I had issues with service down and I had techs coming to my house 6 time until now. The latest was on Feb 2016. The service was down a Wednesday morning. I called and they sent a tech on Saturday. He found 'no issues', but he said that the connection outside my house was loose. The service was up for a couple of hours after the tech was gone but went down abruptly. I called again and they send somebody next Monday. He checked and declared that there was a faulty splitter inside the house. He replaced it, the service came back on, but he said that the wiring was set up wrong with splitters in wrong place and said that the company would redo it BUT with a fee.A week went by with service (wow!!), but next Saturday morning - what a surprise - the service was down again. FYI: By the term SERVICE I mean everything. TV, internet. I called. As usual I went through the trivial, identification, plug, unplug (stuff that I already done), ping, trying to downgrade the importance of the outage. They scheduled a new tech appointment for the coming Monday. Another day off work for me. The tech this time finds that the problem is at the pole outside my house. A box worn out (he showed to me - I could see it almost in pieces) hanging. He said that the pole techs would come and replace it. And they did. I have service since. The same spotty, down at times but it's there.The story does not end here though. They gave me $20 credit for all those days that I had no service. I was pleasantly surprised. Then I received the email with my upcoming bill. To my (not pleasant) surprise they had added a $70 fee for one of the tech appointments. I called again (March 1, I started keep logs of all communications). 1 more hour of my day. I talk with a CS rep and after a long conversation and explanations that the issue was on their end (Comcast) he assure me that he would submit an escalation ticket (#CR565104731) to his supervisor to waive the charge. I thanked him and waited for the confirmation.When it came I realized that they only waived half the amount. Called again (March 4 - my birthday). Rep named Daphne told me that this was the company policy and she would not waive the rest of the charge. I was trying to explain that the issue was not in my end but outside the house at the pole, but she said it did not matter. I should pay. If I did not want to pay in the future I should buy a protection plan. Protection from whom? The same company that I pay for my service, apparently. She also tried to get rid of me stating that the issue has been resolved. Again and again.I demanded for a supervisor and refused to hang up. I also stated that I was the customer with the issue and I knew that it was not resolved as she wanted me to admit. Stayed on the phone for more than 1 (one) hour asking for a supervisor, while she was saying that there is no one available. (Me being in the same business - IT - I knew that this is impossible.) After approx 1 (one) hour she brought on the phone somebody (name Avis) as a supervisor. I doubt that she was one. She tried to get rid of me the same way. I again did not give up and demanded a supervisor (of the supervisor).Finally a supervisor (name Jon) came up after having me waiting (and listening to their misleading commercials) for 15' and he told me that he would waive the rest of the fee FOR THIS TIME ONLY. I have the email with the confirmation. I am waiting for the actual bill to see it happening. Stay tuned. The moral of the whole thing is that Comcast customers need to buy protection plan to protect themselves from Comcast. If not they will be charged for Comcast issues. When there is no competition for a business anything can happen. I have never in my life been treated like that from a company. Much more from a huge one like Comcast. In any case this is life. As my ancient ancestor Socrates used to say 'I get old while I learn'. Thanks for your attention, be careful who you are dealing with and do not give up. If we all raise our voice these things will not happen.
__label__1 I read in the local paper and received Comcast mailing notices that all customers in my area were being required to switch to digital cable. If we did not do so by March 6th, we would not longer have cable service.I contacted Comcast and they told me they could mail out the necessary equipment for free. They also said installation was easy and I could do it myself and call for assistance. The equipment arrived 2 days later. I have 5 TVs but Comcast only sent 2 boxes. When I called, they said there is a maximum of 3 free boxes per house, but I would rent the other two for $20 per month ($240 per year on top of the high rates they already charge). I was livid!I installed the boxes myself and it was simple except, once installed none of the boxes worked! I called the number on the screen and was connected with an Agent in foreign country. The Agent's accent was terrible and I have an awful time understanding him. After asking me a series of repetitive questions, he explained that he could not help and escalated me to a "Level 2" support.Level 2 service was no better. Although they spoke English clearer, they were not able to resolve my problem. The blamed the issue on my local Comcast office not assigning the boxes to my account. They said they could do that for me but it would take 45 minutes. I agreed and the agent said he would call me back once the boxes were assigned and the channels were downloaded. He never called back and I went to bed.The next morning the same problem existed with the TVs. I called Comcast again and explained what had happened the night before. Basically, they ignored my explanation and went through their script. Repeating exactly what we had done the night before. When we got to the part where they transferred me to "Level 2", (at 9 minutes on the call), the transfer did not go through and I was disconnected. Since they had my account number and phone number, I was hoping they would call me back and continue. They did not.I called back (888-634-4434) and started the whole process over... for the 3rd time. This time, instead of transferring me to "Level 2", they transferred me to my local office (804-266-1900), where I am currently sitting on hold.In total, I have spent approximately 3 hours trying to get this resolved. Any suggestions on how to proceed?
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer for over 10 years and have been a very strong brand loyalist. Today, I have been unemployed for 5 months. Recently, for obvious reasons, I got behind on my Comcast bill. When I was in danger of having services disconnected, I called them to explain my situation and say I would have the money the following day to bring it current, in cash.The service rep I spoke with was very flippant and stated I was up for disconnection and she couldn't do a thing to stop the order. All they had to do is stall it for less than 12 hours. But no
__label__1 I have been forced to use Comcast for my business in two locations only because they are the only internet provider in that area. They are terrible. If you have another option, use it. They took 3 weeks for my first location and 4 weeks for my second location to connect service. They send someone to check to see if the building has cable service available and then a week and a half later, they send another person to see if it has a cable outlet and a week or two later, they bring you the equipment. Really? I don't know about you, but internet access is imperative to my business. They initially closed the work order because their GPS didn't show my address. Come to find out, they had the wrong address. You can't get anyone who can make decisions, to answer their phone and they don't return calls. They have hidden fees which is probably to cover the three people they send out to look at the same thing. I wish I had options. Best of luck!
__label__1 I wanted to set up tv, internet, and phone in my new apartment, so I went online on a Monday and signed up for the Comcast Triple Play. Once online, I scheduled an appointment for an installer to come in on that Sunday and set it up for me. I paid my 100 dollar activation fee and was under the impression that I was on my way to having these services taken care of. Two days later I received a call that there was a problem with my order and I had to pay an additional 29 dollars to keep the same package that I ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR. So I said no problem I will pay the 29 dollars, then he said well your appointment for Sunday has to be changed, to which I replied can I install the equipment myself and he said yes I will ship it to you one day delivery.Three days go by and I still have no phone, no internet, and no cable. I call up and after waiting on hold for half hour I am told that I never completed the third party verification and my equipment is on hold until this takes place... I was NEVER told anything about any of that! Finally, I say that this is ridiculous, the least you can do is credit me the extra 29 dollars you tacked on at the last minute. They said that's what the charge is for, the next day shipping! Oh! The next day shipping that I was told would be there on Thursday??? Because it's Saturday and nothing has been accomplished! I was it waived or I will cancel my order and that's exactly what I did, over 29 dollars you lost a two year contract! Great customer service **.
__label__1 I was going to cancel my service and they talked me into staying on with a faster internet service and a new modem. Of course, when I got the new modem, it worked on the landline but the wireless portion did not work. Yes, I know it is cap sensitive and a million charters. When I called in to the little brochure, they slipped in the package it was for signature support services. They wanted to charge me for the support of something they just sent me that did not work. I said that was silly and she said this was the only department that could help with wireless... I hung up with her and called back in, getting cut off two times and spending over 3 hours of my time. I believe the issue is finally fixed now but that remains to be seen. The last service person was great... The three people I spoke with before her were very bad and did not follow through or help me with my problem. I want to switch to Dish or DirecTV now very badly...
__label__1 I've called numerous times about my "bundle". I have the triple play with the home security. They tell me it's going to be over $600 to switch to a different bundle. I was supposed to have free installation as part of my sign up and that was not the case. After two months they decided to refund half, absolutely ridiculous. They told me it wasn't going to be much more than what I was paying before, it's over $60 a month more. I will be canceling my services and I will never go back. I had been with them for over three years and if this is how I'm going to be treated, then good riddance! I would recommend not even signing up for any services this company provides. You will never pay what you think you will be, it will always be much more.
__label__1 I had set an appointment for today (11-8-11) at 8:00 A.M. and asked for a specific technician. This technician had made prior repairs, and I have confidence in his work. I was told that the technician will be at my home between 8:00 A.M. and 8:00 P.M. At 6:00 P.M., a computer message advised me that outage repairs were done and my problems repaired. Not hardly. No show Comcast.
__label__0 This is the second time I'm having trouble with Comcast. The first time was when I was getting my cable and internet installed. Due to the comcast's dispatcher's fault, I could not get hold of the technician even though he was in my building. The technician ended up leaving and I had to reschedule for an appointment later that day. Customer service was atrocious with one customer  service representative hanging up on me because I demanded to speak to her supervisor. I called back and described the situation to the supervisor who was completely unsympathetic to the fact that the dispatcher had messed up, that  one of his employees had been rude and the fact that I had taken a whole day off from work. He said I could either take the measly $20 inconvenience fee or nothing at all.   Three weeks later, the cable went out and I scheduled another appointment with comcast in the late afternoon. 1-5pm. at 2 08pm a Comcast dispatcher called me to confirm if I was still available for the appointment and I confirmed that I was. I called back Comcast around 3 to make sure if the technician was still on his way. The customer service representative confirmed that the technician had two more appointments ahead of me and would be here shortly. At 4 31, I spoke to another customer service representative who told me that the technician would be an hour late. Mind you, Comcast did not have the courtesy to call me and notify me of this, I had to call them myself. I called back at 5 31 to find out what the status was, and I was told to call back after 6, because there is a grace period of an hour for the technician to show up late. Again I was offered a measly amount of $20 for my 'inconvenience.'
__label__0 On August 22, I saw a Comcast truck working on a service box on the lawn between my home and a next door neighbor's house. They proceeded to run an 18 gauge cable 180 feet from the box and down the street crossing my driveway and continuing down crossing other driveways. They put an orange cone out on the sidewalk nearest the box, but on the sidewalk. They left without finishing the job. Today is August 25, and they have not been back to do whatever it is they planned on doing. The cable left out has been a hazard to the children playing, people walking up their driveways, trash men, and mailmen. There is a potentially hazardous box left unsecured with cables running out of it.I called Comcast yesterday and was told they are scheduled to come tomorrow, Aug. 26 and there is nothing they can do about it to expedite an unsafe situation. I asked to speak to a supervisor and when connected to another person, it was to no avail. Today I called again, and was redirected to an office in Canada where two youngish sounding women, kept telling me they were sorry, but nothing could be done. I was never notified previously by Comcast when any work would be done, and what work was being done. Consequences: An unsafe, hazardous situation for children and adults. Spending useless time on the telephone causing me to use up my valuable work time.
__label__1 I've called in for the fourth month in a row about the same problems.  They have been charging me before my promotion is up.  Once they correct it, they carry over the adjustments (credits) to the new balance.  They tell me one thing and do another.  Every month I'm being overcharged.
__label__1 Comcast has the worse customer service out there... I was on the phone for over 2 hours trying to get my billing taken care of. They messed up on my bill and no one would help me. I was disconnected the 1st time. I called back and then the lady hung up on me. Then I called back because I was pissed then the 3rd person I asked to talk to a supervisor and she disconnected me again! At this time I was gonna stay on that phone until I spoke to someone so I called again and ended up talking to a lady who was just nasty to me and disconnected me again. Now I ended up calling back to talk to the last person NUMBER 5 and he sorta resolved my issue but not 100 percent. I swear I can apply for a job at Comcast and my qualifications can be rude, nasty, have no clue on what to do and I would get a job. I canceled Comcast the next day! Guess what? I was able to get through to them in 1 minute when I pushed I wanted to cancel! I told this guy everything and he was trying to get me to stay. I told him that it was NOT his fault but because of horrible customer service I am canceling and this is NOT the first time I have dealt with bad customer service from Comcast. I can't believe they are still in business! I will never ever go back to them even if they gave cable and phone for free!
__label__1 2 days before Thanksgiving 2015, wife calls me telling me cable is out. I call Comcast 'promising' to pay when I get paid. They then LIED (assured me) that services would be reactivated. After SEVEN (7) hours of checking connections, calling customer service over & over & over & sheeesh... I turned in the equipment same day of being lied to & STILL getting CHARGED for a service I am NOT receiving 30 days later. HELLO??? GO DISH and its A LOT better OVERALL.
__label__1 Telephoned Comcast to order service on April 16, 2013. Informed Comcast that my move in date was May 1, 2013. A deposit was required and made to obtain a Bundle service. On May 4, 2013 received a bill asking for payment for one month. Telephoned Comcast and informed them that I had just moved in on May 1, 2013. Comcast informed me that statements commence on the date of order even though services are not provided. On May 1, 2013 a service representative came to my home to install services. While ordering phone, TV, and Internet, the installer only installed TV. Was informed that he had another appointment and had to leave. Leaving me high and dry.While the installer was at my home he broke a $300.00 figurine that was fifteen years old. Telephoned Comcast to advise of damage. A Comcast representative told me that a report would be written and the matter would be closed in three to five days. After three weeks, telephoned Comcast to ask for update on damage issue. At that time, the rep informed me that Comcast was not handling the matter and I should contact Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. Each time when telephoning Liberty Mutual the agent was nasty and refused to assist me.Finally after a four-week wait Liberty Mutual told me that their company was a third party and would not pay for any damage. Liberty Mutual was told that I DID NOT BREAK the figurine the installer did. Telephoned Comcast and reported the discussion with Liberty Mutual to the CEO office and was informed that an executive would contact me to resolve the matter. Three days later a representative - not an executive - telephoned me and told me that Comcast was not going to help me even though they did receive confirmation that the installer did own up to the breakage of my figurine. A week later a check in the amount of $110.00 was received with a take it or leave it statement. Deposited the check and immediately cancelled services with Comcast as I will not deal with such a dishonest company.How do you allow this Company to continue to do business? Comcast continually fabricates, increases payments without notification, does not adhere to agreed prices and denies or feigns no knowledge of what is told from one representative to another, and will not take ownership for what they do. Along with what occurred above Comcast billed for incorrect amounts and did NOT record payments paid. This all took place in a seven-week period!!!! This Company should NOT be allowed to continue to provide any type of so called service to the public. Thank you for allowing me to inform you of what takes place with Comcast.
__label__1 When I went to the fairgrounds in Puyallup WA I talked with Troy that signed me up for just a modem which I was just shopping around. I did not realize he signed me up. I also talked with Steven and we were comparing prices for $99 and $129.99 package. After talking with him I was like "I don't need all the channels for the $129.99" which was a $40 differences. When I signed up with Steven for $99 I was under the impression that DIY and GSN were included in that package, but it was not. It was in the $129.99 package which bumped me to the $129.99 package which I did not want. But in the long run it would be cheaper to stay where I am at.I got 5 bills even before I signed up with Comcast, I sign up on October 3, 15. The first bill I received was $65.93 for the modem which I talked with Larina on Oct 1, 2015 to say I don't have it and would give me a credit. I have the agreement I sign when I first join and sent it to Jon the supervisor on 10/30/15. He was supposed to call me and never did. Then I got another bill for $354.27 then they shut off my service saying it was past due. I have talked with 30+ people, 3 supervisor, 2 attorneys for Comcast and no one has called me back. And also, had 3 accounts now I only have one.Now I got email saying I owe $471.75 which is not true. I paid you guys off on Nov 20 for $67.04. Also, paid $77.04 on Nov 20 then paid on Nov 7 for $50.93 which the total is $194.99 total. This is not how you treat new customers and I will tell everyone I know not to go to Comcast. If I was not in 2-year contract I would cancel the whole thing. But I am not able to do that because I would get charge $230 early termination fee which I can't afford. I am on a budget and not made of money. Is there any way I can cancel and not be charged a $230 early termination fee?I would have stayed with DirecTV if I would have known it was going to be a nightmare. I went with Comcast because it was cheaper and I would get a $150 gift card. Micheal on November 25, 2015 from billing did a good job trying to get my account figure out. Now they sent me a check for $101.87 which was a credit for the old account that they cancel. Which should have been transfer to the new account, but it was not. Now, they are saying I need to pay that amount which is not true at all. This is the worst company ever. They don't have any customer service whatsoever. Even corporate cannot call you back or email you.
__label__1 Comcast has the worst customer service that I have ever had to deal with. Four years ago I had Comcast installed at my home, I immediately started having issues. After calling service and having several different technicians attempt to repair the problems I finally had it disconnected. I thought that after they installed new cable in my neighborhood that I would try Xfinity again and set up an installation appointment. To my surprise (sarcasm) nobody showed up or called. I called to be told that I still had a balance from the last time, but nobody ever notified me of this. I will never give Comcast the opportunity to be my provider again.
__label__1 Check your contract when you sign up for Comcast as their advertised offers do not match the contract they issue. I signed up for $49.99 150Mbps internet for 2 years, however my contract has $19.99 for 25Mbps internet for 2 years. They say there is an add on in place for $30 which boost it to Blast! Pro, however this isn't part of the contract, which means that Comcast can increase the price whenever they want within the 2 years. This means I haven't received the advertised rate. Comcast has so far refused to issue corrected contract, or issue in writing that the $30 will remain at that price for 2 years. I just have to trust them. So watch out, Comcast is doing the usual illegal practices, I'm guessing to catch people out and hope they don't notice and end up paying more than they should.
__label__0 
__label__1 Comcast elected to stop internet service. When I called, I was told that Comcast had decided that the Comcast modem, supplied by Comcast, was at its "end of life". Comcast elected to deactivate it. Comcast elected to do this without any notification to the unfortunate person who made the mistake of being their customer. Comcast has decided it would be most convenient to Comcast for the customer to disconnect the Comcast modem, drive across town to the Comcast office, and try to trade the modem. Comcast will probably decide that it would please Comcast to charge to replace the modem. If so, lawyers will be called.This is an incredibly arrogant self-serving bit of business stupidity - one that stands out even against the slovenly performance Comcast is known for. We will select another internet access provider. Consumers would be wise to not subject themselves to the level of incompetence and arrogance that personifies Comcast.
__label__0 Comcast just took over from my old cable company Patriot Media.  All I can say is how disappointed I am with the Comcast way of doing business.  It took over an hour to pay a bill.  I give them a very bad rating.  Too bad I cannot get Fiber in my area.  The most disappointing thing is they just dont care.I want my hour of time back.
__label__1 Comcast is my internet provider only. They began billing me $20 extra for "unlimited voice" services I never requested. For 6 months I've tried to get them to stop this but each time they agree to but continued the overbilling. They then refuse to credit me with all the bills I overpaid. Today I explained to them that they actually owe me money. Their response was "Will you be making a partial or full payment today?" Really???? I will be finding a new internet provider. They are idiots. I have filed a complaint with the state attorney general. Maybe they will take notice...after all, what they have done to me is definitely not legal. Jerks.
__label__1 I contacted Comcast to set up cable and internet at our new apartment. I spoke with a representative and agreed to a deal where we would get cable, internet, and a DVR for around 100/month. Pretty good. A technician came 4 days later and hooked everything up. The internet worked fine but the cable box was buggy. The next day, I unplugged it and rebooted it which worked for a day and then nothing. On the next evening, I called back and after about 30 min on the phone, the rep said that a technician needed to come and fix it. This was on a Friday and a tech wasn't available until Monday. Monday: tech comes and says a cable was loose and that the box should be fine (I was suspicious, but I let it go). The box was fine... for an hour. When I got home from work, the box is completely frozen and won't change channels or anything. Also, that Monday, I received a bill for $260! I call Comcast, and tech support tries to tell me that I'm using the remote incorrectly. I'm not, I know how to work the remote, I promise you. So needless to say, I'm getting upset. So I tell them that I no longer want their cable service and just want the internet that was advertised at $40/month. They tell me that offer is available to new customers only, and since I am an existing customer, I would have to pay $80/month for the service. Seriously!? That was it, I cancel everything. Unfortunately, there are no real alternatives in my area. Comcast needs more competition. They have so much control that they can easily get away with hidden charges and fees and extremely poor customer service because only they can provide broadband service to a public increasingly reliant on such a service. It's time that we demand an alternative to this corrupted company.
__label__0 We placed an order for cable TV, phone and Internet service over a month ago. The technician came to the house as scheduled and we were advised that due to a storm in the area a month prior, that service could not be set up. The technician supposedly called for someone to install new wiring at the street, which never happened. The appointment was rescheduled and another technician said the same thing. Once again the wiring was not run from the street. Today theres yet another scheduled installation. This time we were advised that because of no wiring from the street, the wiring would have to be ran underground and new outlets installed which would cost $90.00. I have had to schedule the day off on several occasions and work on weekends as a result.I feel that this is poor customer service on the part of Comcast as I work from home and its a great inconvenience for me to have to adjust my work schedule as a result of the conflicting and inaccurate information we have received regarding installation.
__label__0 Comcast uses Non Stop (an independent contracting co) that does their installing cable/internet. I have dealt with Comcast miserably in the past month for installation of service and many failed no show appointments. The technicians that do show up, are spaced out, smelling of pot smoke, or do not speak in English and well past their 3 hour time slot. Then they leave with the internet not running properly and lie and say it will be running in an hour. I have gone weeks without service because they can't return until the next available appointment. I am very very disgusted with Comcast and their choice of technicians. Once Verizon Fios comes out, I am never using Comcast again!
__label__1 It has been 1 month and still can't get anyone out to fix my cable. Have call in every day for a month. Need someone to come out to fix the issue. Made several appointment but no show.
__label__5 Deceptive, bait and switch... always want an add-on. I only want internet and basic cable. Usually good reception, but get unexpected downtime on internet at strange hours. Far overpriced for the internet services. For shows, when you are retired, you only watch news. Do not like to pay for all the other garbage channels even on basic. Get better reception on digital antenna for local news. At least, it does not fade out when it rains. They force you to rent their boxes monthly for reception in other rooms. This adds up on the bill. The average retired household only watches one or two news channels, Fox and local news. Women will like the Hallmark channel.
__label__1 Comcast continues to prove that they have the worst Customer Support of any company on the planet. Having to phone them for any issue is complete mental torture as well as at least a half a day lesson in futility. My latest call yesterday was after I was convinced I needed to replace my modem which was working perfectly fine. I couldn't get any of my devices to activate so after a 30-minute wait, their wonderful Filipino call center came on, asked the standard security questions and put me on hold only to disconnect me. I called back a second time, only to solve the problem on my own after another 30-minute wait.This is SO TYPICAL of the absurd, untrained customer service call centers that they utilize. My greatest hope is that everyone that has experienced the same torture (which must be anyone who has called them) would switch services and once and for all give this giant what they deserve, a nice trip to bankruptcy court. Who is running this company? Don't they have any idea that businesses are built on Customer Service? Maybe they should go to lunch with Richard Anderson from Delta Airlines so he can teach them how to treat customers and build loyalty. Comcast, you should be ashamed of yourselves!
__label__1 My kids' mom has been calling making payments every month, running about a month behind. Comcast has been taking their payments out. Now they're saying we owe about $800. IDTS, every payment that was paid has cleared. To me, Comcast's billing dept is screwing up.
__label__1 March 5, 2015. I have had service with Comcast since 2008. The customer service reps and supervisors are very rude. If you have questions about your bill, no matter who you talk to, you get a different answer every time you call. I have been trying to get my account since January 15, 2015. I still have not gotten it resolved. They overcharge for their services. You would be better off with Suddenlink, DirecTV, or DISH Network.
__label__1 When we originally talked with Comcast, they said that our set cost was $79.00.  We are in it for less than 2 months, and they are coming up with bills amounting to $187.00, then taken down to $142.00, then $88.00, then $166.00.  These people (Comcast), don't know math.  We explained when we opted to go with Comcast, that my son is handicapped, and can not have roller coaster bills. That was okay, until the bills started showing up. Everybody you talk to on the phone, has and attitude, and you feel like, whenever you talk to them, since they have you as a customer, they will just screw you around. My son has a limited budget, being handicapped. His social security only goes so far.  This is not the only bill he has to pay.  We asked them to work with us, to let him pay on the 3rd of every month.  That would resolve all issues with paying on time every month.  They at Comcast choose to be argumentative every month, and I believe they don't want to settle differences.  Come on. When does it stop? When you have a handicapped citizen that cant get what he signed up for, with a company?  Their tactics are uncalled for, and somebody needs to correct them. They will eventually want to cut him off for non-payment of some of the bills, that will be a part of late bills assessed, because they choose not to work with him. Although he is trying to work this out, as a father, I decided I would finally get involved. I will not stand around and watch these people work over a handicapped adult on a budget.  We need assistance resolving this matter.  It is so easy to resolve, if the right person from Comcast chooses to resolve it!  I was told 2 months ago to use Comcast.  I certainly wished he hadn't.  Now, is there anybody out there who can help resolve this for my handicapped son?  Only he will suffer from them not working with us. 
__label__0    comcast was suppost to come to my house ans install the service but the guy they send didnt want to do it.so the excuse he give me was that there was no antenna or connection cables i mean they knew it was a new customer.they were suppost to come at 5 pm too but they didnt show ed up.comcast was not giving me the services for free i was paying for it
__label__1 They are the worst carriers. They had me without cable for 3 weeks, then they send me extra boxes when I only have 2 TV. Also the customer service are very bad, they ** up my order in the computers, then blame me for their B.S. and had nerve to charge me double for the bundles I order.
__label__1 I just spoke with Comcast and found that their economy plan includes CNN and Fox News for $38.95. But if I want to view MSNBC, I have to pay $68.95 which I can't afford. There must be some law or regulation that would require the Comcast to treat all news channels equally.
__label__0 My Comcast specials ran out; cable TV and high speed internet. My bill went up. I knew they would. I spoke to customer care to get the rates adjusted and they did. The six-month specials again ran out. If the subscriptions started at the same time, why if they run for six months? Wouldn't they expire at the same time? Also, my last three conversations with Comcast customer care have resulted in inaccurate and misleading information concerning what and how was needed to qualify for various services.
__label__1 June 22, 2016 I talked with Jewelian **, a Comcast Sales Representative, a conversation that was over an hour. I decided to install internet, TV, and security, install scheduled for 7/2/2016. After several emails to Jewelian **, an attempt to nail down the Saturday install time, I continued to be told the details are being worked on. Friday, July 1, 2016 at 2:50 PM I received an email from Jewelian, informing me that there was no installer available and my appointments had been cancelled. Unfortunately, security is a priority and my 4th of July plans had been canceled so I could take care of this priority. Today, I talked with Ozar to determine what was happening to my install. I was informed that the dates I had were wrong, never was I promised an install of July 2, 2016. Maybe Comcast should return to the recording/emails and really find out what was promised. Believe I will take my service elsewhere!
__label__1 I had my service in Kennesaw GA terminated on March 25, 2015, because I was moving out of state. I mailed my equipment to Comcast using the UPS store # 1998 on Cobb Parkway. I was due a refund of $93.46 and was told it might take up to 180 days to process. I called Comcast on October 2, 2015. Rep told me it would be 4-6 wks before the check went out. On November 24, 2015, I called Comcast and spoke with a very nice representative who told me the refund had not gone out because Comcast shows I failed to return a piece of equipment and was being billed $50.00 for that. I told the rep I did return the equipment via UPS store # 1998, but I do not have my receipt because I lost it during the move. This representative opened an investigation, gave me the investigation number, and told me it would take 5-7 days for the UPS store to conduct an investigation, and then Comcast would contact me.December 8, 2015, I called Comcast because I have not heard from them. I spoke to a representative who told me the investigation was closed, and the UPS store did verify I returned the equipment. So, I am due $93.46. Once again, the check will be mailed in 4-6 weeks. If, in fact, I DO receive the refund due me in January, 2016, it will have taken the company ten months to refund my money. Comcast has held my $93.46 for 9 months now. If Comcast withholds refunds from all their customers like they have with me, there's no telling how much interest they're making on those funds. Is that the plan here, that Comcast makes even more money off people who have closed their accounts?
__label__1 I was scheduled for installation of the "X1" platform". The installer called and explained that he was shorted the necessary equipment and would be late. He was very good at keeping me updated on the status of his arrival. When he arrived, he asked if he could disconnect my DirecTV and I agreed and he went about installing the equipment. When he attempted to register the equipment, the problems started. There was a system wide issue with the satellite and he was unable to complete the installation. He asked his supervisor what to do and his supervisor stated he would come the next day to complete the installation. The next day, NEVER heard from the supervisor. I contacted installation and they then told me I would have to wait a week. I asked about the supervisor's commitment, they didn't care. I called my installer and his supervisor now told him there was nothing he could do about it. DON'T believe any of those commercials they show about improved service. These people at the 800 numbers JUST DON'T CARE. The government is about to allow them to buy up their competitors so don't expect the situation to get any better with these people.
__label__0 I was told in January that I wouldn't get a bill for 5 months after the service was activated and installed. I have had to call Comcast cable out to fix the installation and the reps told me that I would not only get the total install credited but also credits for other problems with my account. There are many calls to Comcast made by me because the credits weren't applied to my bill like I was told. I was also told today that with new service, they do not interrupt services until 3 months had past with nonpayment. I was told this because I complained about the bill coming in January when it was told to me that it wouldn't come until 5 weeks after the install on Jan. 2. So that would make the first bill come in February. My service is now turned off and this isn't the end of April yet. I have been making payment and the credits that Comcast has applied are also payments. So my service should still be on. I have been trying to resolve this Comcast turn off situation and I believe Comcast is at fault and my service should be immediately restore. I talked with Jennifer, who is a supervisor, today and she said that my bill for 4 months of service should roughly be $887.00. I asked her to calculate with me the amount that I had paid with the credits that she said she saw and then subtract that from the $887 for the 4 months service. $126 was paid on Feburary 12, plus $306.70 paid on March 12th and the credits that Jennifer said she saw was about $165.00.If you calculate all of that, it equals $597.70, subtract that total from the $887.00 that Jennifer stated is the roughly totaled charges for my 4 months and that leaves $289.30, which would be due in May not April. Per the only suspension letter I have ever gotten, it stated that if I paid the $306.70 by March 17 and it was received by no later than March 21, my service wouldn't be interrupted. As you can see, that payment was made on March 12. Please restore my service ASAP.
__label__0 My comcast internet connection keeps dropping. I have to re-start the router approx. 20 times in a day. Then i called up for support and a technician was sent in. He checked all the connections to my home and found out that the in-coming frequency from the building cable was low, so he repaired that and also fixed up my Wireless connection. (dont know why the Initial comcast techincian didnt make a Wireless connection in the first place)  Anyways, its back to the same old story of rebooting the router...The connection is down again. 
__label__0 I recently moved into a house. I called and asked the sales representative 1 thing, can they reduce my bill. Comcast gave me a promotion that gave us more channels (more expensive than my basic package) and reduced our bill as compared to the previous plan we had by $15/month for 1 year. The only reason I didn't shop around more was because of this promo. 2 days after installation, our cable went off, and then I was told by Comcast, that they would reinstate it but I would have to call the sales department during business hours to get my promotion back. Which I did and they pretty much said that we got canceled because we were not eligible for the plan (it was for people switching from Dish). I argued with her for a bit but all I got was a condescending "I'm sorry but you don't qualify and there are no promotions in your area."
__label__1 COMCAST is refusing to reissue a refund check in my mother's name, basing their decision on "Corporate Policy". I have come to the conclusion that COMCAST is seeking to KEEP the refund in order to maximize their profits. In short, my father passed away in AUG 2015 from the effects of Agent Orange during his time in Vietnam. Although he knew his time was short, he made sure all of his properties and accounts were "shared" with my mother. He did so to preclude my mom having to go through a Probate Court and/or establishing an Estate Account. The only item he did not foresee in his efforts was having all the bills in both their names. One of the bills which was solely in his name was his COMCAST account. Even though my mother cancelled service with this company, COMCAST refuses to issue refund checks in the name of the surviving spouses of former COMCAST customers. Instead of issuing refunds in the surviving spouses' name, they issue checks made out to "The Estate of **", knowing that the costs of establishing an estate account will far exceed the value of the refund. This allows COMCAST to enrich themselves from other people's misfortune. They did it to my mother, so we have first-hand experience in how they operate. Despite complaints to the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and FCC, COMCAST continues to hide behind "Corporate Policy" in order to keep the refund amount. After 30 years in the military and government service, I know that there's NO policy that can't be amended or overruled. We sent COMCAST a copy of my father's death certificate, showing my mother as the surviving spouse. We even offered to send COMCAST a copy of my father's will, showing that my mother is entitled to all property and monetary accounts. Even though my mother's refund is only $80.25, it's money COMCAST knows they'll likely never have to pay back; the cost of establishing an Estate Account exceeds the value of her refund. If it happened to my mother, I know it's happened to a few hundred other people throughout the United States over the years. COMCAST's attitude toward my mother's request for a refund in her name is reprehensible!! I will NEVER again be a COMCAST customer. I urge anyone with a COMCAST account to help --- please call them and ask them to change this stupid policy. I would anyone who's currently a COMCAST customer to cancel service with this inept and highly corrupt company.
__label__1 Worst customer service ever. I have been dealing with an issue since March 2012 when I purchased a modem from Saveology.com to use at my residence for internet use. Months later noticed the bill was too high. Called Xfinity, in Oct of 2013 and was told that it was their mistake, they couldn't refund my money past 2 months but I was given a decent package for my trouble. Well last month again (Oct 2013), I noticed my bill was high and once again called about it, only to find that I was being charged a leasing fee for that same modem. I was told that it was taken care of, no future charges will be charged, and again, no total refund was offered. I was pissed and told my neighbor who works at Comcast and he gave me a card. I called the card tonight (11-17-2014), only to find that that lease charge is still on my account! Doug ** told me that it is being audited and there is nothing he can do without a receipt. He could not produce a record other than a order number that was originally in error. He said that he trusts that order number shows that I ordered a modem from Xfinity. I checked my records on gmail (Thank God for that storage) and found the receipt. I told people over at Xfinity over and over again, "the customer is always right! Why are you doing this? You make me never want to use this company again!" He responded with he cannot just give the modem away, even though paying $109 plus $8 a month puts this modem at around $300 that is giving it away! Advice if you are going to use this company don't use paperless billing, save your receipts and  don't expect anything from their customer service because they will tell you one thing and another will happen. Either they don't know, or they are lying. I hope that the regional manager for Xfinity Colorado sees this and has the guts to send a written letter of apology and give me a full refund.
__label__0 Comcast is monopolizing us, a city of 180K lower than national median annual wage customers makes TV more expensive than food! We pay more than ANY other place in the USA for this rip-off, they up the cost 2-3 times per year dropping Ch's as they go, unless you have a HD $5K set! The New World Order of cable TV mobsters!I know of MANY folks who can no longer afford cable TV so they stick rabbit-ears up and get 3 broadcast free channels, some go with satellite, cheaper but bad weather cuts service U still have to pay for for 2-3 months per year! Comcast has Spokane by the throat and keeps squeezing the life out of us.
__label__0 A Comcast representative charged me for additional TV installation which I did not want. I tried to explain that there was a charge after 3 months that I didn't understand, and they told me that I had asked for this service. However, based on my bill and initial set up, I only wanted to have my one TV set up for basic cable. They insisted that I wanted a second TV set up as well. This was not the case, and they are forcing me to pay an additional set up fee.This is not right, and nobody is helping me get the charge off my account. I kept being put on hold. I just want one TV working as previously set up and discussed. The people at Comcast say they can't help me and I have to pay another set-up fee. I have heard other horror stories, but I can't believe that Comcast gets away with stealing money from their customers like this.
__label__1 I was on the phone over an hour to discover why my mother in law's service just cut out in the middle of the day - was told by first rep Joshua that he would check signal strength and then after that didn't register anything would do a strongest signal strength that didn't do anything either. Then did a refresh of account and then a STV Hit signal and that returned nothing. Then when he didn't call back after 20 minutes like he said he would I called again and got no where with another rep named Denny and he was going to try all of the same things and after more delays I got a supervisor named Edna who said she could not help me as it was a billing issue - we confirmed that our bill and also the mother in laws bill was up to date - she transferred me to the billing dept. That was actually closed for the night - unbelievable that a supervisor would do that. Such poor customer service. Ralph and Brian Roberts who make millions a year would not put up with this type of service - if it was a billing issue from the get go why not say that - but we know it is not a billing issue for her service to cut out in the middle of the day. This is exactly why we need more choices and more competition and not less and also more regulation and not less. Now I have to call again when the billing dept. is open and that will be Monday and the mother in law will be without service for over three days. I mean seriously, this is absolutely ridiculous. This company is horrible at customer service.
__label__0 A Comcast technician came to my home today to disconnect service, they asked my neighbor to let them in. I do not have any Comcast service. I spent 45 minutes on line with their disconnection department five times. He asked for my account # five times. I told him "I don't have an account with Comcast." He then put me on a "short hold" for 12 minutes then I got put through to the Spanish speaking department! I am quite sure he did that deliberately. What a totally useless company Comcast is. I would never trust this company and if they ever enter my property again I will call the police. Go dish.
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer for over 15 years. Customer service have declined. I had appointment March 5, 2015. They never showed nor did they give me a courtesy call. I called, inquiring about the technician. She told me he had to cancel Due to the weather. I ask the women, "Why didn't anyone call and inform me?" She said they did. I told her, "No one called," so she reschedule for the next day. I am waiting and waiting so I called. She said, "They're running late. They're coming." Another no show. I called and insisting on speaking with management. She put me on hold for forty five minutes only to get back on the phone to tell me her supervisor was too busy to answer the complaint...he would call back. The supervisor never called back. I work from home so I lost money because of this. This company is horrible. I think the problem is the language barrier.
__label__1 Once again, I am experiencing an outage by Comcast and it seems to be over a large area according to other people in town. Usually, it is a monthly problem of internet outage and maybe sometimes having to reset my model or like last week, I was trying to watch an on demand movie which I paid $4.99 for and the picture was scrambled at times and freezing as if there was bad reception. Now, this Saturday December 17th 2011, most of the TV stations were down and I had no internet. This problem began early in the afternoon and was still ongoing at 2:30 am the next morning. Forget calling the repair number, it was busy throughout the entire evening. This is what I get for $150 per month. Recently, I finally had the time to take one of my cable boxes in to get a high definition box. I was told that there would be an additional monthly fee for that. Forget that, no more will I pay Comcast for poor service. I checked with Windstream's phone, internet, and Dish Network service and was offered all three for much less than what I am paying Comcast. My brother has their service and the quality of the TV picture is far better than Comcast. Now, I have heard that after you decide to go with another service and notify Comcast to discontinue theirs that they will offer you a better rate. I for one don't work that way. I contacted Comcast for a better rate and was rudely denied by an employee at their local office. I might add that as a businessman for over 27 years, I would not stand for an employee of mine to represent my company with an attitude such as this Comcast employee. Comcast should take care of and value its customers while they are a customer and not after they are fed up with their service. I have made my decision and plan to switch to Windstream on Monday morning. I have been told by relatives and friends that they also are switching after this lengthy outage Saturday. I am sure Comcast will try to lure their customers back after they notice the drop in customers. If Comcast will not give some sort of refund for this outage, I think customers should file a class action suite.
__label__1 I was on the phone with Comcast to cancel my internet service and the agent offered me another package that was bundled with HBO. The price offered on the phone was $44.99. After I got my bill, the price went to $49.99 before tax. When I received the bill, the price was $49.99 and after talking to them over the phone, no one took the blame and I am stuck with $49.99. Clearly the agents at Comcast are not train to help the customers but themselves.After I got the TV box and tried to activate the cable TV, it was not working. We called Comcast 4 times to fix the issue and they agreed to send someone to help us. But without advising us in advance, we were being charged $39.95 for the service that was supposed to be done over the phone. No agents could help us on the phone to activate the TV and we were supposed to pay for their lacking in knowledge? Very frustrating experience!
__label__1 Recently I had an appointment with CC to install new equipment with a 2 hour window, 8 - 10. Due to limited time, at 8:08, I put a TIME DATED note on the door saying I was taking a quick shower, and to please give me a minute. After showering, I noticed I had a message from CC time dated 8:15, saying they were there and couldn't get anyone to the door. They give me a 2 hour window, and I can't get 7 minutes??? I called their number and got a smart** on the phone who basically said I had to reschedule and "here's the times, pick one, take it or leave it!" Having no choice I rescheduled to the following morning. The guy who came the next day, told me that installers were to give the customer 15 minutes, which I clearly did not get.Yes, I called and complained and I'm sure it got no further that the poor girl who spoke broken English. Pathetic, poor service. I didn't stop there: For the past two years, I've had two accounts with CC, one in GA, and one in FL. Due to poor service, I cancelled service in GA, about 3 weeks ago are returned the equipment. This week when I contacted CC, the only account they could find was the GA account which has been cancelled. Contacting someone online in customer service, and especially online, is near impossible. You have to give tons of information to log in, and when you finally get a "robot" to answer, they ask redundant questions that you've already spent several minutes supplying to get them in the first place. Yesterday when I went thru this process, they could not find my FL account, the only one they could find was the GA account which has been cancelled.I'm amazed at the costs of cable in the first place and they just keep going up, and up, and up, adding crap charges that you have no idea what they are. God forbid calling for an explanation if you have high blood pressure!! I'm in a condo who contracts to CC and I have no other choice other than putting a dish in my living room, which sometimes I seriously consider. Wouldn't it be great to have a big company such as CC, to actually listen to you and sincerely tried to solve your problems, instead of treating you like a prisoner, which basically I am? Instead you are ultimately told the KMA, and "live with it". If you have a choice, I strongly urge you to do your homework before signing on to CC.
__label__1 Cable Removal for Construction -- Mr. Tom Karinshak my name is David ** and I'm in Jacksonville Florida. I have been trying for three weeks. Do you have someone in the residential service to disconnect your cable line from an electrical in order for me to have the electrical remove the pole in order for me to build a new home. The first day I called which one is three weeks ago. A gentleman by the name of Pete came out looked at it and said it had to go to another department and they will be in touch with me within 24 hours. That never happened. I called again and spoke with these people in one phone call, Jasman, Shanail, Julie. I was told it had to go to residential services and that someone would call me on Saturday morning March 19. Guess what? That never happened either. I called on Monday the 21st and no returned my call then. On the 22nd I spoke with James and then a young lady by the name of Janet. She told me that the job was set up on them to take the line down 3-28-2016. I let her know that would not work. I need to demo the house. I asked for her supervisor. When I did that she found this funny and chuckled on the phone, said "hold on a minute." After waiting another five minutes to get back on the phone and said he was not available and he will call me back within two hours. It was 2:30 Eastern time. She said his name was German **. Guess what? It is now 7:30 Eastern time and I have yet to receive his phone call. And need someone that has another authority do you contact me to remove your wire this week. I have never been forced to work with any company as incompetent as Comcast. The first work order I was given was **. Nobody with your organization can tell me what happened with that. The new work order number is **. I need someone to respond with a reasonable date to come and take your line down. My contact information is David ** or I can be reached by email at **. Now I have spent close to 7 hours between phone calls and now I have spare close to 7 hours between phone calls and this letter. Not to count the 45 minute drive to meet Pete the first day then a 45 minute drive back to my office. If you have anybody in your organization that is competent enough to do that I would appreciate them contacting me.
__label__1 From the first day, our experience with Comcast has been terrible. The first installer was hours late. He did a sloppy installation, leaving a giant coil of cable and not installing connectors correctly. The second technician said the first was a contractor and "that happens" - as if that should excuse it. Since then there have been non-stop problems with the set top boxes and the network/phone interface. Other Comcast Voice customers often can't hear our voice when we call. One of our four setup boxes malfunction or lock up on the average - approximately once per week. Solution from customer service rep every time we call in after waiting 10 to 20 minutes on hold - unplug, reboot, and wait 5 minutes for the defective box to restart. We have had the service for 9 months. It was bad as ever. I recently turned off the WiFi portion of the cable modem and installed an external unit that I bought because the Comcast WiFi kept going up and down all the time. I am looking at ways of trimming back on Comcast triple-play bundle services and substituting other vendors until our 2 year contract is up. Never again!! 
__label__0 Comcast was contacted about installong a cable modem for acess to the internet. Installer spent more time on his cell phone yelling at his girlfriend then he did with the install. Surprisingly(?), the modem refused to work, so he uninstalled all my Anti-virus and Firewall programs. Unfortunately, I had to work so my mother, who knows nothing about computers, was left to deal with this fool. I came home to a mess, the hard-drive was totally corrupted and full of viruses and spy-ware.
__label__1 I am very, very disappointed with the Comcast service. I tried to pay my bill on the phone automatic service and my cards were declined. Why? I have no idea... In any case I called Comcast at 7:30 pm. It is now 9:45, I'm on hold with my house line... I decided to call with my cell as well. I have 2 phones, one on each ear and I want to scream. I am so upset.... I will hang up and call AT&T!! I give up!!! Very unfair, poor service.
__label__0 Well, let's just say Comcast keeps reeling me back in and I never learn my lesson! In April 2010, I was solicited by a sales rep for Comcast regarding their service. We decided on a 7-room installment, internet and phone. He stated that my bill would be anywhere from $170.00-180.00/month. Since I was moving, he guaranteed me next-day installation at my new home.I was shocked to see the technician arrive at my home. He was there for 6 hours. He completed 4 of the rooms and only hooked up 2 phone jacks and the internet. He stated that he could not complete the installation, because he would have to drill holes on the outside of my house to get the cable installed in the remaining rooms. He then stated that he would return to finish the room. Well, if anyone has ever moved before, you know that cable is the last thing on your mind. We never received our first bill (so darn typical of Comcast). Then we were surprised to see a bill in May for over $400.00. So my husband decided to contact Comcast, and as usual, if you owe a balance, you can't get through. Finally in June, we were able to get through, thanks to a friend who works for Comcast. My husband spoke with a young man by the name of Stefan who guaranteed that we would receive some type of compensation for the inconvenience of only having 4 rooms installed and for the phone. Well, my husband was so happy for him being so understanding. He stated, "Don't worry about the phone issue; we can live with only having phone usage in 2 rooms." What a wrong thing to do! Stefan also guaranteed that a tech would be by that Saturday to finish the installation (which happened 2 months later!) and that we will receive a new bill with the credits. Although my husband had not wanted to pay a thing until it was corrected, he paid 1/2 of the bill. His philosophy: 1/2 the payment for 1/2 the work! So as promised, a technician was out to complete the job (and he didn't have to drill outside!). This was on 6/12/10. Well, needless to say, it is now 6/28; and we have no phone or cable. And God only knows when the internet will go down. So we contacted Comcast and spoke with Josie who stated that there was no record of the credits (Go figure!) and that she would need to email Stefan to find out what type of credit he was going to issue! (So we were to wait all over again!) So I decided not to wait. I immediately called back and spoke with Roz and asked for a supervisor or manager; she refused to patch me through. She said that she needed to get info from me. Needless to say, I never spoke with a supervisor. I explained my situation to her, and she stated, "Well, on 4/19, we credited your account $79.50 for the installation." There wasn't supposed to be a charge for the installation! And she said that the most she could do was credit the remaining $51.95 for the installation. Again, there wasn't supposed to be an installation fee! And that is not good enough! We have gone 2 1/2 months without the proper installation. She then stated that she couldn't do anything else because we were only charged for the package and the 2 HD boxes. But hold on, our package was for a 7-room installation! What in the world! So needless to say, after speaking with Roz, she transferred me to Jennifer in collections who started by saying that we were not getting another credit for anything else, even after I explained our situation. She said that we needed to make up our mind as to what we were going to do because our account was in the red and that we haven't made a payment since we started the services. What?! I was furious by this time and stated that my husband paid over $200.00 with Stephan via a debit card. She looked and saw the payment and said, "Still you need to pay the $208.00 before your services will be turned back on and you need to decide what you are going to do!" What kinda customer services does Comcast think they are providing?! Since they basically cornered the market in my area, we are pretty much stuck with them! Comcast needs to remember that it is customers like me who provide them the money to pay their bills, not the CEO. Without the customer, you would not have a job!
__label__0 I am currently involved in a battle with Comcast over the restoration of my service. All of my services have been unavailable for over 36 hours at the time of this writing (from a neighbor's Bright House connection). I have made three separate calls to their customer service line, and each time the main customer service center is blaming this on the dispatch center. They continue to push notes to the dispatchers saying that this is urgent 24-hour-SLA service because I have no dial tone, but I've heard or seen nothing further. Yet I'm told I'm not allowed to know anything about the dispatchers, name, address, phone number. All I can do is complain to the service center management who "promise" to get on the issue with the managers of the dispatch center. I'm pretty much at the end of what I can do, short of cancelling my service, which is the next step.The real story here is that I came to Central Florida from Pennsylvania, the home of Comcast. Up there, they treat customers far better than they do down here. My concern is that this company is making inroads in the state of Florida (due to the Adelphia acquisition) yet abuses its customers here in many different ways, from Internet service data caps to not having enough service personnel contracted and available to resolve situations effectively. Even for routine service installations, they have been averaging 5-7 days from what I've dealt with down here, much longer than Bright House or other service providers, and way longer than the 1-2 days back in PA. I feel that Comcast should never have been allowed to operate in the state of Florida to begin with and should not be allowed to expand further without significant improvements to its systems and processes. Furthermore, HOAs and municipalities should be alerted to the issues that this company brings with it and the perils of negotiating with Comcast for service should be made known to them.I intend to bring this issue to representatives, both in Tallahassee and DC, in the hopes that if this company is to continue to be permitted to operate in this state, that it shape itself up to what it ought to be.
__label__0 I am unable to access the internet on one of my computers although it shows that I am connected to the network.  I called comcast and they told me they could help me if I purchased a tech team internet service for 40 bucks.  I did and they transferred me to get help.  I have now been on hold for now exaggeration. One hour and 22 minutes and still waiting. I am filling this out on the computer that still works, so far.  I wonder if they are hacking into my system and knocking it out as a way to get me to sign up for this new service. Help!
__label__0 After 5 months they are still billing me for both personal and business accounts, even after I terminated residental services.  I have called and in ONE DAY spoke to no less than 13 people.  Still is unresolved.  Now they have cut my services.  I have made payments to personal account, but they will not apply these to my business account.Loss of business from termination of services at their mistakes.
__label__1 I used Comcast and the internet never worked for a year. I called and wrote but no one could fix it. Switched back to verizon and it works Great. Comcast LIES. FIOS is faster and more reliable and something needs to be done about the false advertising from COMCAST/Xfinity saying their service is faster than FIOS when it doesn't work at all . NO JOKE. IT never connects, then if you get lucky, its slow or it kicks you out. Please do not subscribe to them.. A Big rip off and the FCC needs to do something.
__label__0 To be honest I never look at my cable bill I pay 100.00 every couple weeks or so to keep it current because I don't care much for them. Comcast recently interrupted my service for  having an outstanding balance. When I called to inquire I was told I owed 285.79 which were all ADULT Pay-Per-View movies charges, 22 of them ordered over a five day period. After much protest I was told they will do an investigation into this. After 2 wks I was informed that the bulk of the movies were ordered from my childs box and many double ordered (the same movie ordered at the same time on another pay-per-view channel). The times they were ordered varied 8am, 2pm, 11am, 6pm, 7pm, 10pm, 11pm, and I never sleep before midnight and I'm up by 7am on weekends and 4:30am during the week yet Comcast insist that despite the fact that during my long history as a customer I have no history of ordering ADULT MOVIES. Comcast rationale, because it takes 5 STEPS to order a movie it could not be a mistake they even made an inference that I am an inattentive parent. They did however credit my acct for all the double ordered movies at the tune a mere $67.00. They refuse to do anything further except turn off my service at every chance possible while I attempt to resolve this obsurd situation. Has Comcast done this to anyone else? I think they may be supplementing there income during these econmically challenging times by doing this. I have filed a police report & I will file a complaint against Comcast in court. A friend is willing to file a class action lawsuit. I have had to pay 520.00 to restore my service as my new months bill was also added, all right before Christmas.
__label__0 Comcast should be ashamed to call themselves a business. I have not been able to view any videos on my internet. Upload speed .48. They drop out TV programs and the list goes on and on for more than a year. Numerous telephone calls to customer service. What a joke. All they know how to say is I am sorry and we appreciate your business. Why can't a customer get an address for corporate headquarters?I had faster service years ago from AOL. Every time Comcast supposedly upgrades their overall service mine goes down. I wish some class action suit could be taken against them. If I had another option for internet, I would use it. The consequences have been loss of use of internet and no TV guide that I pay for with TV package. So much to say and it would take too long to write. My advice to anyone: do not use Comcast.
__label__1 Hating AT&T, I decided to try Comcast. They were so bad with misleading information and broken promises during the long install process, that I just cancelled my order and decided to live with what I have. I escalated to the Chairman's office (Brian Roberts) and dealt with a team of flunkies who told me they would care for the problems with the install appointment window. I left my trust with them and they never called back. I called their number many times and cannot even leave a voice mail for the chairman's escalation office. If this is how they treat NEW business, I can't imagine what kind of dirt you must be as a paying customer. My prediction - over the next 10 years, Google will have this oligopoly of incompetence beaten and beaten badly. Google will provide both voice and internet service and the usuals will finally get what they deserve.
__label__0 Well, 5 months ago we were informed by AT&T that there is only one line coming into our house but we have been charged by Comcast for 2. We have a large house and I was told by a tech from Comcast 5 years ago that we had to have separate bills or we would be regarded as stealing cable. There is only one electric line coming into house and one water source. Only one pole outside with lines coming in on one side of the house. Now, we have been trying to get this resolved and by my calculations, they owe me almost $10,000. They are refusing to help me and I have since gotten a hold of the DPUC and found that they do not regulate them but they tried to help. Comcast continues to say that they are investigating, but in the meantime, they have sent my bill to collections while they are investigating and will not return any of our calls. We have asked the boxes to be turned on again but they will not turn them on and they won't give us a reason. I am stumped as to what to do. They did send out 2 men on 12/22/09 to see that there is only one set of lines coming into the house and we were also told by several Comcast customer service people that it is against the law to double bill a customer, but we were unaware of this at the time.
__label__1 Crap, just plain crap. Their internet suck and I pay too much ** money to get this result. When I'm in the farthest room the internet is really, really pissy and I'm considering a ** switch. Also I've got the UNLIMITED data plan, and at the end of the reset time the speed of the internet gets crappy as hell which it shouldn't but I know that if it's at the beginning of the reset time that the internet is fast but usually it's been really ** pissy and often the service has been going down a lot. Overall don't waste your money on this ** horrible internet.
__label__1 I got a call from Comcast customer survey and was asked if I was satisfied with my service. Since there was so many drops in connection recent days, I replied that I was not satisfied and told about the problems why I was not satisfied. Immediately I was offered with a new package which I was told would have a better performance. No information on why the service I had was degraded.  Having been a Comcast customer for 3 year, I asked him if he could switch to the new plan without any contract. The reply was "Yes sir, we could switch to the new plan." To confirm I asked again "Could you switch to the new plan without any contract." I was not given an answer and this guy hung up the phone without any response. He did not even have the courtesy to say whatever I asked is not possible. I am not willing to continue with Comcast anymore. Reasons: 1. Service quality is not as advertised. 2. So many disruptions. 3. Customer care does not provide clear and open answers to questions on billing. 4. Finally, rude guys in customer service.
__label__1 My service got interrupted due to non-payment (which I forgot to pay). When I paid the bill and service was restored, the internet is slower than slow. I called Comcast to inform them about the situation and of course, they are telling me that my personal modem is outdated and rent one from them for over $10.00 a month. I explain to Comcast that there is nothing wrong with my modem and didn't start having problems until service was interrupted and restored at a slower speed. So I asked Comcast if they slowed down my internet to get me to purchase and rent their equipment and got no answer from the service agent. What does that tell YOU??? I am going with another internet provider.
__label__1 Comcast essentially has a monopoly in our area, with all other choices being as bad as their services. I have felt overcharged, abused, and have been flat-out lied to about my services and billing. I can't wait for Comcast to go out of business forever.
__label__1 Today's date is 8/11/14. I discontinued my Comcast service on 7/16/14. I recieved a final bill for $93.05 on 8/2/14 with a due date of 8/27/14. I called the 800 number to question a couple of charges. One was a $2.99 charge that they removed. The other was an unreturned equip charge of $30. Comcast said it would take 2-3 weeks to investigate and they did not know what the missing equipment was. In the mean time, they turned my account over to collections. It is not due until 8/27/14. I called again and they said because I questioned the unreturned equipment charge, it is automatically sent to collections. The collections agency does not care about the details and are very abusive. They demand the money. Now I have to respond to the collections agency in writing to dispute the charge or, as they put it, "This is going to damage your credit if I don't pay them". No wonder Comcast is losing business. Sincerely, Rodney
__label__1 Starting just over 2 months ago, we have had interrupted Internet service. It incapacitates our business because it means we have to reboot our modem physically. Its impossible while we are working remotely. The service people have been here three times but they cannot fix it. Anyone else in Southeastern Pennsylvania having this problem? We are going to have to move to Verizon Fios.
__label__1 We began to notice that channels were disappearing from our viewing. These were channels we had watched before and enjoyed, but the price we pay each month to Comcast has remained the same. We contacted Comcast but got a definite runaround with no answers. The explanation was that the channels themselves had pulled their viewing from our package. We are furious and can get no answers. We should not have to pay the same monthly fee if services have been reduced!
__label__1 I briefly rented a modem from Comcast years ago before buying my own and returning it to the store. Luckily I was smart enough to keep the receipt. Every few months for the past several years they've added the equipment rental fees back to my account and every time I've asked them to stop they've threatened to bill me for the full replacement cost of all the equipment I've returned; hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Each time I've read them back the # on the receipt and they've relented, but each time I've spent hours on hold.
__label__1 I had no problem with Comcast (I'm a fairly new customer) until a couple of months ago, when I sent in a payment on my account. When the next month's bill came in, it showed this amount unpaid and past due. I double-checked my bank account to see what had happened with the payment. It HAD cleared my bank account. I called Comcast and was asked to fax a copy of the cancelled check to them, which I did. I was told it would be cleared up as soon as they received the check. A week later, I called just to follow up. The amount was still not cleared up and I was told by a different rep that this type of matter could take up to 2-3 weeks to resolve because Comcast had to wait for information from THEIR bank to find out where the funds were erroneously posted. I explained that I understood their problem, but that they're trying to internally track a mistake in posting shouldn't prevent them from crediting my account (To add insult to injury, my Comcast account number was written in the memo portion of the check.). The next day, I received a collections notice from on the account, and when I called to explain the situation, the "collector" insisted that I pay the disputed amount AGAIN and trust Comcast to credit it back to me when they got it straightened out, which I refused to do. I asked to speak to a supervisor, who told me he wouldn't even accept the reference number I offered so he could see for himself that the bill had, in fact, been paid. After that lovely phone experience, I called the Comcast business number AGAIN, asked to speak to a supervisor, was refused, and was told that all the customer service reps could do was document my calls, because the problem was being handled by "accounts receivable". I asked for a phone call to someone who was actually working on the problem and was told the customer service rep was not "at liberty" to give me that information. But he assured me that he was taking the late fees (which I did not owe in the first place) off my account to make up for my "inconvenience". To date the matter still isn't resolved. I would NEVER do business with Comcast business again, nor would I ever recommend them to anyone else. Oh, one other thing, just to REALLY add insult to injury, I get a junk mail come-on from Comcast business almost every day, urging me to sign up for the service I already have. This company needs SERIOUS help.
__label__1 AS the only high-speed internet provider in my area I am forced to do business with Comcast (DBA Xfinity). They are a complete nightmare to do business with. I had an installation performed on October the 21, 2015; They left the cable laying on top of my lawn, telling me it would be buried within a week. More than a month later I am still spending 30 minutes to an hour a week on hold with their customer service trying to get them to come bury the cable (a service I already paid for with the installation fee). Every time I call they give me a ticket number and tell me I will receive a call the next day to schedule the service. Each time I get a call telling me the cable will be buried in about 5 days as still the cable sits there.I am now getting nasty notes from my HOA about the cable so today I asked for a supervisor to speak with. I have been waiting on hold for more than half an hour now... Still no supervisor. In my experience this company has zero sense of pride or accountability. Every representative I have spoken to during the last month gives the impression that I am somehow at fault for their continuing failure to do what they have been paid to do.
__label__1 We have had our service in our new home for almost a month. We have had internet but not cable, although we are paying for both. I have been on the phone for goes with customer service and not had the problem resolved. Two technicians have come out and not properly set up the cable. They said it was our TV, although before moving we had perfect signal and picture on the TV previous. They changed the cable box and the cable worked for one day then stopped working again. I have had to schedule yet another appointment with a technician to come out. Waste of time and money. Will not be using Comcast again.
__label__0 I have had many problems with my Comcast internet service. Last Monday, I called and complained once again on how my internet wasn't working. I was to be home the next day so someone from the service center could come by from 2:00pm - 5:00pm. I sat home 3 days before Christmas for this person to come. At 4:30pm I called Comcast again, and they told me that I had to call back at 5:00pm to complain. So at 5:00pm I called back not too happy that I sat home for 3 hours waiting for someone that never came. An escalated ticket was sent out and now I had to be at home from 5:00pm - 7:00pm. Again, no one showed up. Today is Thursday, December 24, and I still do not have a working internet. I complained to supervisors and they were very unprofessional and obviously not doing their job. I am so unhappy with this service and have told all my friends not to use Comcast. I am at a friends house right now using their computer to send this e-mail. Your customer service is horrible.
__label__0 I wonder why there is no closed captioning on any news and mini movies in any channels. I am very disappointed and won't watch these if there is no closed captionings because I am totally deaf and won't understand the lip speech at all. Please correct or contact Comcast Cable, I guess in PA. or Indiana.
__label__1 After more than 10 in person contacts, chats, emails, phone calls... with COMcast (communistcast) about what I get vs what I pay for, I had to go the FCC complaint route to get the Ogre to look my way and address the still unresolved problems I have. I feel like a nat bug flying in the face of the beast and being swatted away as if I am just an annoyance to the ever money hungry service monopoly monster. Every time I make contact with it, it seems my bill goes up.A key problem with my service is, I pay for HD reception. One would expect that the cable box provided, as it is required to received service, will allow it. After 3 technician visits, I got the answer why I don't get full hd. I was told by the last tech visiting me that the box "required" to get it is the high end DVR one, only. No other cable box they provide will give full 1080p or better reception. This is an intentional corporate misrepresentation, no counter, phone or chat agents were aware of this fact in my conversations. The best I can get is 1080p, ok but nowhere near as good as it could be. If I had a newer 4k or better tv I would probably have complained to the tv maker thinking there is something wrong with it only to find out the signal I get doesn't provide. Remember when your dvd and blu-ray movies looked awesome on your low tech tv? Over the years, the tv and movie disk makers have compressed the signal/content which reduces quality, making you want the newer better picture quality models. Comcast seems to do the same thing with their video signal, forcing you to want their higher end service and pay through the nose for it.After posting my FCC complaint I got a call/voice mail from a Crystal ** of Florida Executive Customer Relations within 2 days. I also chatted with a supervisor online who promised to send me the dvr box that would allow 1080p, even an email to confirm its shipping, but even after 5 days the tracking # given doesn't say anything more than a label was created and no return call from Crystal. Since I already feel like I've been patronized so they can get to the next complaint, my assumption is more calls/chats will be needed and not have permanent resolution. If I want faster than a snail internet service, I am forced to use Comcast, as they have a monopoly over my area. I cannot use a dish, and that's another can of worm service fixings by providers. The infrastructure is there, why isn't it usable by any provider instead of just 1 predetermined company?
__label__1 I cancelled this account long ago at this address 2801 Fruitville Road, Suite 150, Sarasota, FL. I called last month to get this straightened out and I keep getting invoices, previously it was credits. I am getting fed up with this, I keep paying thinking this one is the final payment.
__label__1 I had decided to bundle my phone, Internet and cable in order to reduce the separate amounts I was paying for all three. Comcast contacted me about this and I was on the phone with a representative for 30 minutes just to find a plan that could work for me. We arrived at a $180 monthly bill, still high but better than what I was paying. At no point was I told the bundling would create additional one-time charges, replace my existing DVR box and remove HBO from my channels.When I called back another representative found that if I had just added HBO, my monthly bill would be lowered to $159 monthly. We did so and I was content until I received my monthly bill, which was for $302: $159 for the services I wanted, and $143 in fees for bundling, none of which I was informed about. I called and went through a variety of representatives before being told that it would take a week to review the phone call in which I made these changes to verify if I was correct in saying I was not informed.That would have been bad enough but then the following Saturday the cable/DVR box stopped working, and I spent an hour on the phone with the reps to fix it. None of the attempts worked. They wanted to send a technician to look at the problem but I would pay $50 for the visit. Moreover, who can stay home from work all day to await a service tech? I have a kind retired neighbor who will do these things for me, but this isn't my only utility or service need, and I can't take advantage of her kindness. Finally, after removing the box from its connections, I managed to get the cable box to work again until Tuesday, when it stopped again. I managed to get it working again until Saturday, and nothing I did or the Comcast reps did could get it to work again. It was suggested I take the box back to the local office and exchange it for another.On Monday, with Presidents' Day off, I went to the office to exchange the box but the office had closed due to inclement weather, while all other utilities and many other businesses were still open. While I was there, another customer showed up for similar reasons. A repair truck from Comcast pulled in only to tell us what we knew, that they were closed. As we gave him our complaints, he literally rolled up his window and drove away in mid-conversation. I managed to get the box working once again, but noticed that I hadn't had any phone calls on my landline. I checked it, and it hadn't been working the entire time. In addition, my wifi always has to reboot when I start using it, instead of being on constantly the way wifi works!There is no one to appeal to at Comcast, and every bit of service costs you more. The reps are all patently nice and polite as they inform you the company has no flexibility whatsoever. Clearly they are trained to be pleasant in all situations, but they are never helpful. It's like talking to a person wearing a constantly fake smile as they hold you at gunpoint.I've yet to hear back from Comcast about my bundling call, which I have no doubt will be found in their favor. I've yet to figure out how to get money back for having no phone service and spotty cable TV at best. Without competition and regulation, the cable companies are holding consumers hostage, and Comcast is the kingpin of the gang.
__label__0 
__label__1 Comcast services suck as their Technical support. I had a very low internet speeds from the start and been advised by the Comcast support team to upgrade my speed. I paid more money and took the service but still with same result. I escalated the issue in this February and they provided me 150 Mbps blast which is so bad sometimes my youtube stops steaming and recently it was so bad they could do nothing and internet wont work. The technical support guys gave up and the technician who came to my house gave up and found no fault. I asked the guys to compensate me with higher services for fault for all these days as I never got higher internet speeds which they promised. The answer I get it is they cannot compensate me or get it resolved. This heights of unprofessionalism and business ethics. Stupid guys always cheating the customers with ** stories. I am planning to move to Verizon FiOS.
__label__1 I have had Comcast for little over a year. At first my bill was $130, one year later went up to $160. After one year they took away channels, pauses at least once a day to where I have to restart box and as of 2 months ago my bill went up to $200. I called Comcast to find out why it went up again and tech apologized and told me bill would go back to $160. When I paid the $160 I was charged remain balance of $30 on my next bill. I do believe I was lied to because they had no explanation and tech just wanted me off the phone. When I called back again I still was not told why there was a increase but they would not fix my bill. Liars.
__label__1 Steady bill increase. Called to ask why? This conversation resulted in me negotiating a new rate and updating my equipment. Scheduled a tech for 10 days out. Somehow the appointment was cancelled by a tech BUT my new contracted service began charging me yesterday. They also turned off my DVR service. So now one hour and 32 minutes, 7 live people and one accidental hang up by a supervisor, I still have no answers. It's pass the buck at its finest. Total lack of concern for their customers. They hold a monopoly and treat customers as expendable. How are they so huge and have no accountability?
__label__1 I canceled Comcast Internet service when I was moving to a new state. I received two bills after I canceled service, the last one coming 5 weeks after service was canceled. I called Comcast to ensure that it was my final bill and the Comcast rep ensured me that it indeed was my final bill. I paid that amount and thought I was done with Comcast.About two weeks later I get a letter from a collection agency stating that I owe Comcast $73 and that I must pay $157 to the agency. I never received any bill or correspondence from Comcast and when I called to talk to them, Comcast stated that I had a credit of $85. The $ doesn't really bother me, but I am in escrow on a house and this account has knocked my credit score down over 100 points and will significantly affect my mortgage rate. I had nearly an 800 credit score and this thing has knocked me down to the 660's. I'm working to get it all straightened out, but it may not get worked out in time for my closing, if at all.Comcast Internet wasn't any good in the first place, but this ordeal has been a real thorn in my side for weeks now. It has been echoed on this site often, Comcast has a monopoly and truly does not care about service or what kind of damage they do caused by their clueless reps. If you research Comcast and still go with them, I've got no sympathy for you. It's better to go without than have to deal with them. 
__label__0 Comcast came to my home to add the internet on August 13, 2009. The technician arrived and went to the office in which I was having it connected. He drilled through the wall and hit a wire. As a result of this, I lost electricity in two of my bedrooms. He was unable to hook it up in the bedroom, so I asked him to temporarily hook it up in my family room. He left and I contacted Comcast the following day asking them to have someone out and take care of the electricity. I spoke to a supervisor who did not call me back until the following day. This went on for a couple of days. An electrician was finally sent out on August 20th. The electrician had to cut 4 squares out of the wall in the office in order to find the wires.I then started contacting Comcast to let them know that I needed to have someone come back out and hook the internet up where I actually wanted it to be. I also let them know that I would need someone to come out and fix my wall. I no longer dealt with the supervisor I started with. I was passed to another supervisor who I have been talking to. She told me she would take care of it and would call me back before she left for the evening. I never heard back from her.I then called Comcast and I was directed to another supervisor because the customer service agent wouldn't put me through to the second one I was dealing with. The process of my explaining the situation started all over again. This went on from August 21-30th. I am still waiting on a phone call regarding the wall and the hook up. I have spent many hours on the telephone explaining what is going on. I have taken two days off work. I waited for the technician on August 13th and another day waiting for the electrician. I suppose I will have to take more time off work waiting for someone to fix my wall and the installation, again. I've been sitting on the floor in the family room for over 2 weeks because I have nowhere else to put my desktop computer on.
__label__1 Comcast is a joke and I WILL NEVER give them my money. They are a very greedy company and they do not care about their customers or employees. I won't say too much but I will say this: LIES. They are liars. Price will go up month 12 on a 24 month contract. They have equipment hikes once a year. Their internet sucks. There's never nothing on cable. The home security is a joke. If you change your location and you're at the end of your agreement you are automatically place in a new contract. They do not care about life events. They want the early termination fee, no question asked. DO NOT DO IT. Not having is better than the stress.
__label__1 Eight months ago, I was dissatisfied with the internet service I had before. So I went searching for internet through Comcast as I already had my cable TV through them. I spoke with a woman and told her I was looking for a better deal for internet service, and asked what she could do for me. She told me about different plans. One was what is called Econo Internet Service, it sounded very reasonable. The installation would be spread out over 4 months on my bill. Then there after my payment would be $26.99 + $7.00 for the box rental total $33.99 a month. This month our bill came from Comcast and my husband was furious as our total bill with cable was $123.63. My husband has been out of work since January of this year. So we started to go over our cable bill and realized that for the last 3 months the internet was $36.95 and $35.30. So my husband called Comcast to talk about the problem with the price of the internet. Not only was it wrong, but the math for the internet part of billing was wrong. They informed my husband that that internet service we got from them was a promotional, which is an outright lie because I was the one (Linda **) who spoke with the representative for Comcast when I got the internet. And she informed me that she has this particular plan Econo Internet Service and was really pleased with it. At no time during our conversation discussing the price after installation was paid off that this was a promotional fee. And that it would have gone up. If she had, I would have declined to get it and searched elsewhere for a better deal. Because of my husband being unemployed at this time, money is almost non-existent and every penny counts. And one thing we have to have is the internet for him to search for work and keep applying every week for his unemployment benefits. So instead of canceling the internet for the time being, we had to change our cable TV programs to accommodate for the unfair practice in extorting more money from the consumers. Now I understand why Comcast is rated one of the ten worst companies. They deserve the title. But mark my word. As soon as my husband is employed again, I will kiss Comcast internet goodbye. I almost forgot they told my husband that this promotional was for 6 months. I am livid for them lying like that.
__label__1 I have made numerous complaints about the condition of the cable boxes on the side of the house, and the jumper cable they have running out of the ground, and across my driveway taking the last 6 months trying to get it buried. After numerous e-mails and job submissions, but not 1 finger lifted in months to complete the repairs.
__label__0 Comcast has to have the most inept people around or at least some of them. I subscribe to their triple play and while going over my bill realized that I was billed for directory assistance at .99 cents. I never use this service. I spoke to James operator ** appeared to be a friendly person but it went round and round for over a half hour. Yes over a half hour before it was ever removed. At one point he asked if I wanted the directory assistance feature removed and said no. He just couldn't understand my saying no and went on and on. Just plain dumb and bad training. Right now I am sitting and waiting for a supervisor to call me back. It's not the .99 cents. It's just Comcast's continual bad, bad service. Amazingly bad. Oh, from time to time I've gotten very helpful people at this company but not often enough.
__label__0    comcast CABLE surge blew and fried 3 routers and my modem and a 62" tv! I replaced all equiptment and had service out and now my internet is slow and freezes all the time .it is just horrible! tv signal is ok I have tried everything w/comcast and get nowhere. comcast has arrainged thier insurance co to pay for tv and equipt. but my service is the pis. WHAT CAN I GET THEM TO DO?
__label__1 I went to bed around 11:30 pm on Monday, June 25. I was up late watching TV. TV and internet services installed by Comcast this past May were up and running fine. On the 26th, we had no service. I contacted Comcast. The CSR I spoke with made me pull all the cables out of my entertainment unit and troubleshoot. It was determined that a technician was to come to our home and the nearest date available was on June 30th to evaluate the outage.Comcast called the morning of the 29th, later that afternoon, sent an appointment confirmation email, and called the morning of the 30th to confirm my 3-5 pm appointment window. At 3 pm, I was outside, playing with my daughter as we awaited the arrival of the tech. My cell phone was inside, charging. At 3:18 pm, Comcast called, yet again, to confirm my appointment. I was outside waiting for the tech and did not hear the phone ring. They cancelled my appointment. I called, furious, as we put aside time on a Saturday and missed a family party so that we could get this taken care of. The next available appointment was on Tuesday, July 3.On Sunday, July 1, my area experienced a severe storm and power was knocked out for several days. Upon the technician's arrival on the 3rd, after the same amount of confirmation calls and the email, we were told that he could not inspect our home because of the power outage. Later that day, a worker for Commonwealth Edison, the local power utility, knocked on our door. He asked if we had Comcast service in our home. My wife said we did and he said that the connection on the pole was fried and that he would contact Comcast directly. I called Comcast again and told them this. The promised they would have a line technician out to the house to look at the issue on Saturday. We were home all day that Saturday, July 7th and no one from Comcast came. The next appointment we were given was Tuesday 10th between 1-3.On the 9th, Comcast called to confirm twice, and again I confirmed the appointment. I also received an email. This was the two-week anniversary of the original outage. We wanted nothing more than service restored, so my wife cleared her afternoon and was at home. I was at work. I confirmed the appointment call earlier that morning. However at 1 pm, Comcast called while I was riding up in an elevator and I did not have cell service, so they cancelled our appointment again. My wife contacted Comcast. They called dispatch and not too much later, a Comcast truck pulled up in front of our house and then a few minutes later, drove off, no call, no knock on the door, no nothing.The evening of July 10, I called and asked for a supervisor. He gave me a new escalated ticket number and said that he would have a line technician come to the house on July 11. No one ever came. The evening of July 11, I contacted Comcast again. I waited on hold for 40 minutes. The CSR finally answered and she told me I needed to talk to technical support, so she transferred me, so I could wait another 40 minutes on hold. Finally, I talked to someone who transferred me to the escalated ticket department. He claims that he will contact me directly today about having a line technician come to my home today. Nothing yet. A regular technician is scheduled to come on Saturday the 14th but all he will do is tell me a line technician needs to repair the connection like I've been telling them for over a week.Today is July 12. I have set aside six hours of time, awaiting a Comcast technician to show up and they have not. I have been told twice that a line technician was going to come to my house; they have not. I've been hung up on or disconnected, routed back through and put on hold for extended lengths of time. I've been told by a utility expert that my connection is fried on the utility pole. I've told this same story to countless individuals that work for Comcast. I have been without internet or TV for over 2 weeks. I've been offered a $25 credit for my inconvenience. I was told by the CSR on July 10 that she guarantees restored service by this Saturday, the 14th. I'm not optimistic, considering that conversation was for not b/c the CSR I spoke with 24 hours later had no notes on my account regarding the conversation I had previously about the arrival of a line technician yesterday.If I treated a customer of mine like this, I would be fired. If I ignored two dozen complaints from a customer over the course of 16 days, I would be fired. Unfortunately, there is really one choice for ISP service in my town, and that's Comcast. If there was any better option, I would've fired Comcast 14 days ago and would not be writing this complaint now.
__label__1 I was a new customer to Comcast for their cable services. Will all begin with I moved to a new address and I had a scheduled appointment to have it transferred the next day after I move. Well, while I was at my old address still moving and cleaning items out of my old address, a Comcast technician showed up and I asked the technician, "Aren't you at the wrong address?" And he proceeded to tell me that this is where the new service was set up at. Which sounded kinda awkward knowing that I set an appointment to have the services transferred to my new address and I asked the technician, "How can you install new services when the services are still on here?" All I need to have them transfer it to my new address.So the technician called the customer service on his phone and explain to the representative on the phone that there was a mistake made and I need to be corrected. She spoke to me directly on the phone and reschedule my appointment for the next day even though I asked her, "Since the technician was already here and I'm only two streets from our old address, can he come over to transfer the service that he's already over in the area?" She told me, "No." So I left it at that. The next day my second scheduled appointment the technician again went to my old address which I thought was hilarious because this is what happens at the first appointment so I called Comcast again and they assured me that they will take care of the issue. They're not really sure why that happened a second time so this is day number for no services.New appointment was scheduled and guess what? The same thing happened again. By this time I am like, what is going on with this company? The next attempt they didn't show up for my services again that they said that there was services in my home. What? Then they told me that the services was in someone else's name but it wasn't me, what? I just could not believe that all these things can happen with one company. Of course again has a call to find out what is the issue. Now why there's not a technician 5th time? Well the customer service again said they will send someone else out to install my cable services. By this time, I'm just like this is outrageous all I want is my services up and running. Well on the phone for another hour and clarifying that everything is correct I proceeded to say, "Okay let's give him another shot here," 'cause I really want to go to another company. Well this time he didn't show up again so I spoke to another customer service rep which I thought was really good at trying to get all my questions answered but before they even have my cable service is up she's offered me more products and I was like, "Excuse me but can I get my cable services on first then ask me if I wanted anything else?" It was like okay another 2 hours dealing with another customer service rep from Comcast. The next day I come home to more boxes from Comcast boxes I can't even use because my service isn't on. Insane, I know. Well this is now a 7th time. Guess what? Finally there's a technician and he proceeded to install my cable services until he tells me, "Well now we have to run. Oh my new bill line in your home that's going to be a $30 charge." Are you serious? After all the stuff I went through with customer service you will turn around and charge me more money on a job you guys suppose to do weeks ago. "Fine," I said. I'll pay for it just please get the service is up and running. Then they were up and running. What's in 1 hour, my cable services went down. The two boxes in my bedroom with both froze up. This is ludicrous! What is that hell going on with this company? So now I have to waste more time call them back which I did and they said they will send someone out in two days. Anyhow if they would credit my bill for $20? What only $20? I've been trying to get this thing up and running for weeks and all you offer me is $20 off my bill. I thought it was $20 if they didn't come or if they're late, so I should have over $100 taken off my bill for the services. Okay by this point I am furious. I contact customer services complaints who Comcast which they reached out to me to try to correct the issue which I was kinda happy to hear because I wasn't getting any feedback about my issues with my cable services and they offered me a whopping $30 off my bill. I thought it was a joke so now in total that's supposed to be $50 off my bill but guess what people I only got $30 off my bill the other $20 I was promised by the other rep didn't happen.Well then my first bill came and guess what is a whopping $228. What I've had my services on for only 17 days and I have a bill of $228. This is too funny and the bills of a partial services I wouldn't have paid $175 within the next week then I have a new bill that came out and new bills $422. What in the world are they charging me for? So I looked at the bill they have me charged for five boxes and I only have 3 and 2 boxes they're charging me $20 a piece. What is going on with Comcast? I have had it I am now cancelling my cable services with them. This has the worse customer service.How can they continue to make the same mistakes over and over then turn around and charge you double of what your services are? I only had 135 channels plus Stars channel paid an additional $15 just for the HBO. These customer service rep should not be in this business. No longer will I deal with bad customer service. I am done dealing with Comcast in there have cited services so I am now putting my business over to DirecTV. What they are offering more channels for $100 less. So goodbye Comcast. Hello DirecTV.
__label__5 I subscribed to have cable and internet provided by Comcast on 7-17-2012 for self-installation. On 7-19-2012, a technician came out and said that our box outside wasn't working and we needed to have our products installed. We called before he left our home and we had a scheduled time for 7-24-2012 for installation. The customer rep said they will be calling us to confirm our appointment. No one ever called, so we called and spoke to Glen in customer service to make sure our appointment was still on for the day because I took the day off. He stated I was wrong and we had no appointment. I stated we did and I wanted to talk to a supervisor. He stated 4 times that his supervisor was busy and I could not talk to them. So, he ended up connecting us to the local area Comcast and they dropped the call. We had to call back and this time, we got JR in customer service, who did put us to a supervisor Rose. She connected us to our local area again, this time, we talked to Karen and she stated that she was sorry that everything was confused on our order, it said it was cancelled but completed. I said it was not completed, so she took notes and told us she was giving all our information to the emergency techs and they would be calling us in 30 minutes to 2 hours. 4 hours went by and I called back to Comcast customer service. I got Harry and he was very rude, laughing at me 3 times. I stated I wanted to talk to a supervisor and he asked why. I told him he was not taking me seriously. He told me he was and that I was wrong for wanting to talk to a supervisor. I had to tell him over and over that I wanted a supervisor. He finally put me over to Michelle, who was not his supervisor and that she was just another supervisor, but she would help me. I stated to her that I wanted to talk to Harry's supervisor. She also stated Harry's supervisor was busy. I told her I wanted to talk to her supervisor. She reluctantly gave me to Rex, which I am not sure if he was her supervisor. He connected me to Louis from our area, a technician. He was very rude and told us that we ordered self-installation and that for him to come out to our home would cost us $50, but he would cut it to $25. I told him no, that after the way we were treated, we wanted it to be installed for free. He told me over and over again that he would not, I would have to pay $25. I told him we just wanted to return our cable boxes and not have the company's services. He then connected us over to Ben in customer loyalty. I told Ben that we did not want Comcast products, that your company treats their customers very badly and I can not believe how we have been treated. He stated that he could send out boxes, but we would have to get the products to UPS ourselves. I told him this was unsatisfactory, that it was not our fault, it was the customer service that Comcast has. All we wanted was to have our cable box and internet installed and then the phone went dead. I can not believe how Comcast treats its customers, who want good quality products with good customer service. The company misrepresents itself on great customer service. So here we sit with 2 cable boxes and an internet box, and I am going to have to go through this whole process again because Comcast cannot get anything right. It sickens me knowing how little and how rudely Comcast thinks of its customers.
__label__1 It started when I moved and took my equipment with me to the new address -- Comcast try to charge me for the equipment. Problems continued, as each month my bill was incorrect, my service would be turned off and I would spend hours on the phone trying to clarify what I owed and why they didn't have the same payment history that I had. At one point they said my payments were going to the old address, as if I was paying for someone else's services. The customer service person would say they'd fix it and then the next month would come and the same thing would happen again -- hours on the phone, completely incorrect billing information... to no resolve.
__label__0 I called Tech support to make sure their website was compatible with my Mac 10.3.9 & was told by Mellisa that indeed it was. So it was installed last Friday. 2 hrs. later, I could not get to their email site as I got error message that I needed 10.4 to continue. I cannot update my computer; so now, I can't send emails. They had to replace the modem as I was not getting any internet nor mail. Now they've threatened to charge me 2 visits. As a new customer, they quoted me $101.77 which after it was installed, I paid $171.26 & I was to get credit for the over charges. Well, today it yet went up again, to $129.76 & that it will now be $171.26 the following month?! They hung up on me.
__label__0 I cancelled my HBO service and was charged a $1.99 to process my cancellation! Since when do we get charged to get rid of a service?  As consumers if we decide that we don't want a service we have that option to cancel and not be charged for it.
__label__1 I had recently been having problems with slowdowns and tiling on TV and Internet. I contacted customer support who eventually transferred me to technical support. They told me I had an old modem which need to be upgraded. I was concerned about additional fees which I couldn't afford and was told there was no additional fees, nor did I need to pay more for the modem.I went to their offices and asked for the modem. I asked if I would need to pay more for that and was told no. I was then offered a wireless modem, and again I asked if that would mean an increase in charges. I was told no. I was never given a contract to sign and I assumed that the modem was supplied with the service much as the converter boxes were supplied.Even after a technician came out, I still have problems with slowdowns and I still have quite a bit of tiling on my television. When I got the bill I found out there was an additional rental fee for the modem of 10.00/month. In ten months I will have paid for the cost of an excellent modem from a retailer. In 5 months I will have paid for a decent workable modem from a retailer. I contacted customer service, they agreed to remove the rental fee for one month while they investigated. They then offered me a long time customer promotional offer of $39.99/month for a year. Later I returned to my bill. Although they did remove the modem fee for the following month, the promotional offer wasn't applied.Further, customer service requests were cut off before I resolved the issue. I sent in a complaint to the FCC and also to my state office (which it turns out doesn't regulate Comcast!?). The state office representative replied and said they would forward my concerns to Comcast. I then got two email messages asking for a time they could contact me. I replied to both email messages and also left a message on the phone number they gave. No return call. This week I got two more email messages asking me to let them know when was a good time to call. I replied to both and forwarded my reply to the state office (which has a working relationship with Comcast, but no regulatory authority). Still no callback but the week is young. And still no promotional rate applied. Comcast is the only broadband service provider available, so changing is not an option, although I'm beginning to think sacrificing speed for better service and responsibility may be the way to go.
__label__1 I disconnected my service in February of 2013. That's right. THREE years ago. I returned all equipment in person and it was confirmed that it was cancelled. I have asked for the refund of $51.35 that they owe me. I get a statement every single month (for THREE years) that tells me they owe me this much. But I do not understand why they will not pay it.Then, on 11/04/15 I get a statement that says they are charging me for Internet. I have not had or ordered ANY internet or services from them in THREE years. Why in the ** are they charging me now? And then I got another statement for even MORE money in December. Again, for a service I do not have, have not ordered at ALL. They are LITERALLY stealing from me. This is the worst company on the planet. They treat people like crap, lie, cheat, and steal.
__label__1 I have been with Comcast for 7 years. Got new infinity modem. It never worked maybe 3 months. Had service men out here every other month. One even got caught lying that he fixed something and didn't touch it. They owed me some credit. I also have spent hours on phone getting different stories. Now they want 500 to turn it back on. The supervisor told me I didn't complain enough to get all my credit and couldn't go back to last year and see how many I had to get them to come and fix it. I finally got fed up took modem back in June...no credits, no cable, bad business. Something has to be done about these crooks. Pissed in Alabama.
__label__1 6/21, internet stops working. Call Comcast service line. Talk with someone who apologizes for the inconvenience. Determines that the modem (supplied by Comcast) is not working. Says they can send someone on 6/24. I explain that I work on the Internet and that I cannot be out of touch for that long. Person apologizes again and says they will escalate the trouble ticket and I will hear from someone on 6/22 by noon. Noon on 6/22 comes and goes and I hear from no one. Call Comcast again. Supervisor apologizes again and says the the escalation was denied but that I will hear from someone at Comcast by 10 am on 6/23. 10 am on 6/23 comes and goes, and another call to Comcast and another supervisor apologizes for the inconvenience. This supervisor "guarantees" that someone from Comcast will call and that a service person will come to my house by the end of the day on 6/23, but just to make sure, I have an appointment for a service call between 3 and 5 pm on 6/24. You guess it - no call and no service on 6/23, but service tech does come to my house at 4 pm on 6/24 and "fixes" the Internet problem. By this time, I have spent more than 2 and a half hours on the telephone with Comcast. Fast forward a few days to 6/27, and internet is out again. Another call to Comcast, another apology for the inconvenience. Supervisor promises service by midday on 6/28, but, no surprise, no one shows. Another call to Comcast, another apology for the inconvenience and another promise that someone will call between 10 am and noon on 6/29 to arrange to fix the problem. No one calls or fixes anything and another call to Comcast and another apology for the inconvenience. This time, no promise of quick service (I think by now they figure I have caught on that they can make all the promises they want and I can't do anything if the promise is not kept; so why bother), but there will be a service person here between 8 and 10 am on 7/1. I'll believe it when I see it. It's pretty clear that there is a disconnect between the folks who take your call for service and the people who actually fix things and Comcast just as clearly doesn't seem concerned about that disconnect. Oh, and when I called and asked for a credit for the service that I'm paying for and not getting, then Comcast offered to sell me some additional services. Sounds like a good deal!
__label__1 We have been stuck in the phone wheel of death for 2-3 hours on three occasions in last three months trying to get resolution. They send people out who then have no idea what they are doing. They get on phone with supervisors, look for direction, spend hours in my home wasting our time then tell me someone will call me the next day to reschedule. On the last and fourth such visit, we were scheduled to have the whole house rewired as we get 3-5 mbs and pay for 100! Supervisor Alex comes out then tells me they were not scheduled for rewiring, we were scheduled for troubleshooting. I lose it of course and after 1 hour on phone with numerous people, he says they will have to reschedule. Says he will not leave the property until it is resolved and rescheduled. I leave and go to work as he is to call my cell phone. He never calls and of course leaves. I am left back at square one. I am at my wits end. I have a house full of teenagers and need to often work from home but with spotty internet I pay a fortune for, we are out of options.
__label__1 I began calling Comcast to address the problem. This took hours of my time because you are always on a long wait when you want to reach Comcast. And then, when you do reach a person, the call is often dropped and you have to start all over again. A tech worked with my niece to help her "boost" the internet, but it wasn't strong enough to handle a Skype call. We live in a very populated area and Comcast has a lot of households sharing band width. In the meantime some guy in India tried to get us to convert to their "Triple Play" and sign a contract with them. When they called back to get me to agree, I told them flat out "NO" and hung up. They sent me an email saying I needed to agree to the contract so I called back and the rep I talked to that time said, "NO, you're on the double play and we don't do double play with a contract anymore." He told me to ignore the email. Still having trouble with the service, I called back and asked if they would come out and fix the wiring since it had been installed badly in the first place. The guy said it would be 49.95 per outlet to fix. I asked to speak with retention and told them I wanted the wiring fixed without charge. They said they couldn't do that. Then I spoke to another rep who said she would get someone to come out for one fee $49,95 and she would put me on the same plan with Showtime free for 3 months. She also told me the tech could put in a 2nd internet outlet and all we would be charged for would be the modem each month. When the tech got here, he couldn't believe how screwed up the wiring was. He was here for 5 hours fixing the mess. When he finished putting in the second internet outlet and went to have them turn it on, they told him it would be a 2nd internet fee every month. We told him to forget it. A few months later, U verse came knocking at my door and I decided to try them. I waited until the service was completely installed and then called Comcast to cancel. The service rep told me I was on a 2 year contract for my double play! I said I never agreed to a contract. He insisted it was on a contract and I'd be liable for an early termination fee. Now, I'm having to fight them to get out of a contract that lasts another 22 months.
__label__0 My family and I have had Comcast Hi Speed internet ever since it was made available in our area. We have been very well pleased with the service. We love Comcast's speed, and their very courteous customer support. Keep up the good work, Comcast, and my family will be customers for life. Comcast rules.
__label__1 Its necessary to change cable box to digital service. When the box was connected, it disabled the other box on the TV in the bedroom. After trips to Comcast and 4 and 1/2 hours later, its still unresolved. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told the supervisor would not talk to me. I asked the person on the phone if she was speaking for the supervisor and she said yes. This is the most poorly run organization I have ever dealt with. There is no such thing as customer service. Bottom line: they don't care about the customer and it shows every time you have to deal with them.
__label__0 I asked Comcast if I could reduce my services with the company. I have a bundle package which includes Cable, phone and Internet. The company said that I would be able to adjust the package to a price I would be able to afford but they will charge me a $150 cancellation fee. I was not canceling their service, I only needed a better-priced plan. Is this legal?
__label__1 I recently found out that someone fraudulently created a Comcast account in my name, never paid. They sent it to a collection service, and now it has ruined my credit score. I contacted the Comcast fraud department to try and clear this up, and they have the worst process for helping out. They will not give me any information or the name of anyone I can talk to. I have to get police reports, FTC affidavits, proof of residency, etc and fax it to a number and then just wait. No way to confirm that fax actually made it or they have what they need. Was told by the person on the phone that I just need to fax it and wait and someone will eventually call me back. Seriously!! He said on the phone that they've had several complaints about this before and management knows, but he would not transfer me to them to talk to and refused to let me speak to anyone else. Just rude and then hung up on me after I kept asking for more help. I'm not even a customer for Comcast, and I think they have the worst service ever!
__label__1 Email not working as email is down and tech support hangs up, charging for equipment and services I don't have. Each customer representative has a different answer. TV is unwatchable at times, sound go out and pixelation, over 2 hours on phone and no restitution.
__label__1 I gave 30 days notice to Comcast to disconnect my services. They harassed me with warnings of sending my name to collections. They demand I give them 60 days notice to disconnect. I paid them over $8,600 in the past 3 years, and these bastards refuse to dc my services.
__label__1 The advertisement showed a price of $49.99 w/o a contract for TV and Internet with a download speed of up to 100 Mbps. This is a BIG JOKE. After dealing with the Internet going down every morning and coming up late afternoon I did a speed test and found one night I got a speed of less than 1 Mbps on download and the next day a download speed of 3 Mbps. I called customer service to find out what the contract speed was supposed to be and was told I was to only get up to 3 Mbps download. What happened to the up to 100 Mpbs? Is this just a come on to buy extra equipment, higher contract fees? I had DSL for 10 Mbps and was down only 4 times in the 5 years I had them. I am sorry I switched to Comcast.
__label__1 My cable never works. The Internet connection is never available. The cable box don't work at least 2 to 3 times a week. I will never use Comcast again. Horrible service. Horrible customer service. Should go ahead and declare bankruptcy and liquidate existence. HORRIBLE.
__label__0 
__label__1 I signed up for a TV service promo back in May 2015. The promo was suppose to be good for 1 year. Then back in July 2015 I bundled my service by adding internet. The bundle promo price was $49.99 plus equipment leasing fees, taxes, etc... and the promo price was suppose to be good for 1 year. However in December 2015 I was taken out of my promo bundle price and charged $20 more, then in January I was charged $30 more.When I called in with my concerns about my bill I was told at first by a manager that he was going to have my info sent to the department that could fix my problem by that department entering in the correct codes that would put me back in my promo that hadn't expired on my account yet and I would be contacted by email when the problem was fixed. I in turned stated I would pay my bill as soon as the problem was fixed.I checked my balance every couple of days and the balance remained the same until I checked yesterday 01/13/16 the balance was now more than doubled. I called in and was althoughly told Xfinity/Comcast is not offering that promo anymore so if I wanted to keep my current service I would have to pay the new price or choose another promo that would result in me losing some of my services at around the same price or I would have to upgrade and pay more. This not good business, they are currently offer all types of promos on their website right now that says good for 1 year when that is not true. They should put the price is subject to change whenever.
__label__5 I read all about Comcast's customer service reps and was prepared for a nightmare. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the sales rep Sally. She helped me set up my new internet deal Lickity Split. People complain about how things weren't part of their agreement or other things of the sort. My advice if you're preparing to wrestle with Comcast reps go in prepared and be firm on your choice but also be polite and you'll find a much more pleasant experience than that which you read about.
__label__1 STOP allowing this company to infect our community and take over overcharging our neighborhoods. Comcast infects all of us with bait and switch. VOTE NO to allowing them to continue moving into our community with screwing everyone they can. Well, NO one can find THEIR Comcast contract I signed, so MY copy is worthless with all their supposed additional increases EVERY year. OVER 100% increase with ADDED fees, in ADDITION to the overcharges for NON working WEEKS of NO service. Couldn't call 911 for emergency! NO internet for 2 weeks. NO TV for 2 weeks, and now only at intervals at random times daily! I have logged (in THEIR system) over 150 calls of NO service in a year, yet, their "right to increase from $89/mo (really ends up being $134/mo) will NOW go up to at LEAST $200/mo.Terms of contract keeps changing with each person I talk to. Then I'm told by administration that COMCAST is NOT responsible for what the call takers say or promise. They can say anything, promise anything and the customer can do NOTHING about it. Forget credit, or contract rate agreements. They don't exist!!! Rude people that continue sending your call to other departments, that can't help you because "that is not my area". To make a nightmare longer, you end up paying for their great bait and switch while they keep repeating the ADs of TV lingo of cheap prices, no service, equipment that does not work, and the "bundle" fails at least 3 hrs EVERY day. I seriously think everyone needs to call their area gov rep to complain and vote to DENY any future applications to "moving into or trying to increase service areas". THEIR public voters are being screwed by their being sold non services providers.
__label__0    service was insalled with used equipment,installer was rude, and uncooperative. had a few of no service because wrong equipment was installed, another man came and corrected ,service was good for a few days,then my outside line was tapped with a splitter by another serviceman to supply my neighbor with service, resulting in a weak signal and poor video service,i complained and a new man came and ran a new line from the pole and said theres a problem at the pole some other guy came and worked on pole but i still have poor video, i have been billed almost 500.00 for the first month of which i have still have poor video i even went to the personal expence of installing a signal booster and for a few days i had good video after that i have had poor video since ,apparently comcast is unable to provide watchable television to me and i dont think i should have to pay such high prices for a system that doesent work. what do i need to do to get watchable t v and why should i pay for this type of service,
__label__5 I recently moved across town and used Comcast Movers Edge to transfer my service to the new address. An installation appointment was scheduled & the technician showed up as promised. That was 20 days ago. Today, I turned on the TV and instead of expected programming, I received an error code. Called Comcast, who eventually restored the picture by resetting the cable box. I was then informed that I owed more than $400.00 dollars (despite being enrolled in auto-pay) and that I should log on to my account to pay the bill. After logging on, I discovered not only that the account showed my old address but that my email accounts hadn't been transferred over to the new address either! After being passed around to three different people, I was informed that they couldn't verify my identity over the phone and would have to go to a Customer Service Center in person to straighten it out. They screwed up the account, and now I have to waste my time to straighten it out?!? The numerous ads for Movers' Edge are tantamount to false and deceptive advertising, IMHO. Their idea of "transferring" service apparently doesn't include billing functions, which is nothing less than idiocy! If I'm only "transferring" existing service, why are they (Comcast) acting as if I initiated NEW service?
__label__1 Back in August 2011, I was offered a 6-month package by Jessica **** at Comcast. I was already paying $78.08 a month for internet and basic cable. When I spoke to Jessica, she offered me a plan that would include a lot more stations plus Cinemax and HBO plus a faster internet speed. The cost would be only a dollar or so more. Fine, I want it. It will not cost me $99.99 a month. She would be giving me a credit of $20.00 a month for six months which would bring the total amount to $79.99 but I would be getting more TV and faster internet at 12 MB. I am disabled and have been out of work for a very long time. This sounds wonderful, I was so happy. After six months, it would go back to the $99.99 a month. Well, I have emailed her several times trying to get the correction fixed because I am still being billed wrongly. She has in response and said that she has emailed her supervisor for the codes but with no response. Since then, I have nothing but billing problems, email and internet connection problems. Every one says they cannot change the price so I have kept emailing Jessica. After three months now, I am being charged for Cinemax until now. They say that they are crediting it and the service calls to fix the internet and still it has not been done. I cannot believe how much time I have had to put into this. Furthermore, they will credit one and not the other when I have called on the same day. This has to be wrong that they can continue to keep my money and say that next month, it will show up as a credit and so on and on. What do I do?
__label__0 I signed up for Comcast back in July 2007 for a basic cable package. I was excited because I had all the channels I wanted. Then, shortly after I received them, they cut half of my channels out without informing they were changing over to digital. I had to pay the same price for the channels I was now not receiving. Then, I left to go out of the country so I discontinued my service. I came home and asked Comcast if we can reconnect my cable service. I asked them if I will receive CNN and Fox News with the basic cable service and they told me oh yeah you will receive even more channels, so I am like great sign me up! The Comcast service rep told me I have to be home between 12:00pm and 4:00pm because that is when the guy is going to hook up my service. So I waited and I waited and I waited. Finally, I called Comcast where is the guy who is to come hook up my cable? She told me there was no connection with my account. I am like what! I told her I called the week before and asked for them to hook up my cable, and they told I had to be home between the hours of 12:00pm and 4:00pm. She told me I do not need to be home when they hook up my cable and that she would try and get someone out to hook up my cable. They hooked up my cable finally, and I got all the channels I wanted like they said. I left the next day to go out of town for a week and a half. I came home and half of my cable channels are gone! I am like ugh! I called Comcast and asked them what the heck is going on. They told me oh with basic cable you only get 32 channels. I hit the roof going what! I told them that I talked to the customer service person and they told me I would get these certain channels with basic cable. The service person said no, you do not get those channels. I said I want my service shut off. I no longer want to deal with your service. They told me I still have to pay $37.29. I was like what? I was not the one who made the mistake here. I then called customer service again this morning to talk to a supervisor. I shared with the supervisor the complaint I had with Comcast that I shared with the other customer service person and felt I should not have to pay for their mistakes. The supervisor told me, oh that Comcast messed up and gave people several people more channels than they should have not gotten now, as if that was going to make me feel better. I told him they need to honor their customers because they are the one who made the mistake not us and that we should not have to pay for their mistakes. He told me I still have to pay the $37.29. He told me I can file a complaint with Comcast if I wanted to. Like that they were really going to do anything about it. I did not think asking not to pay the bill was a big asking price for all I have gone through with Comcast. Help.Well I, along with others, am paying for their mistakes. I had put my time into trying to get them to remove the charges because of their mistakes. I paid the same amount of money for channels I did not get back in 2007-2008. Money is lost here and time.
__label__1 I've been trying to unsubscribe from Comcast.net website just for several services I have with them. If you want to add a service, the website loads lickety split. Try to manage your service otherwise and you could wait for gee, I don't know. It's been over an hour and still says it is retrieving my account information. If you want to deal with Verizon, AT&T or any other number of cell and cable providers, they have retail outlets all over the major arteries. But in my market, Comcast is buried in the woods and looks like a dump compared to the competition. Unfortunately in my neighborhood, Comcast is the sole service provider so I have no choice if I want cable.
__label__1 I am at home from work for the third time this week to get connection service and no one has showed up again!! I'm not even a customer yet and I hate this company. I just called CenturyLink to come out here. They have cost me six hours of pay this week.
__label__5 On August 11th I was watching a show on demand. All of a sudden my tv froze and my phones and Internet stop working also. I called Comcast and got disconnected 3 times. Was bounced around to multiple people and had to repeat myself over and over again, never mind the wait time. Finally someone fixed my phones and Internet. To this day August 14, my cable on my main TV and demand doesn't work. I'm a court officer in a busy busy court, Comcast stated that they would call my cell phone when they were going to be at my house on 8/14/15, surprise they never did.I asked my chief if I could leave because they were supposed to call between 1-4. I got home at 1:30 and received a message on my HOME PHONE that they was here and no one was home and that I would have to reschedule. So I left my job early, having to use my time and I haven't had cable or demand since 8-11. But my bill is paid every month. I think this company is the most unprofessional incompetent company I have ever dealt with. I plan on reporting them to the better business and telling anyone and everyone not to ever get Comcast. You would think that they would want to be proud of their company and do whatever it takes to help these customers. Not them. They are shameful.
__label__1 On March 4, 2014 I placed an order online via Comcast website to have services installed at my home in Jacksonville Florida. Comcast offered online a basic digital service of $19.99 and an installation date on Sunday March 9, 2014. Today I received an email from Comcast advising that it was crucial that I contact a toll free number and speak with a customer service representative to discuss the proper selection, billing, and installation of your chosen services. Upon contacting the customer service representative I was informed that the package I was offered online and that was confirmed online I would receive was not available and the only other basic digital option offered was for a price of $44.99. In addition, the installation date that I chose online (Sunday March 9, 2014) that was also confirmed online was no longer available and the next date was Wednesday March 12, 2014.I am extremely disappointed in the way Comcast portrayed a service package and an installation date to me as a consumer that was never available in the first place and that I was dumped into the lap of an offshore third-party company to handle my dissatisfaction and who has no authority to assist me (the consumer) with my concerns I have as it pertains to the bait and switch practices I have fallen victim. When I asked for an escalation number to voice my concerns I was told to go to Comcast website. Being that Comcast has a monopoly on cable services in Jacksonville my concerns about Comcasts unfair practices as a consumer is warranted for regulatory review. Prior to my filing complaints with all the regulatory agencies and advice from my attorney, I wanted to first provide Comcast with the opportunity to assist me with resolving my legitimate concerns pertaining to unfair consumer practices.Please contact me ASAP to attempt to resolve the issue and restore a customers confidence.
__label__0    I have had comcast for a couple of years now. My sevrice is out every other month. Which doesnt make sense. I called to let you know and it takes an hour to get threw. I have elderly parents and small children that needs a phone incase something happens. You guys are quick to cut your severice off but take your time to send someone out. Never once have I gotten a call back when I left a messgage with a manager.  
__label__1 I switched internet service from AT&T to Comcast. A big mistake. Now, I cannot watch PBS NewsHour videos. Everything else (Netflix, CBS, NBC) works fine but not PBS. Their customer service rep says (on a chat service) that the problem is with the site. This is an old, completely lame excuse that I discovered Comcast was using two years ago with Netflix service until Netflix agreed to pay them a fee for service. It is one thing to block a commercial site, but to block a public service site is horrible. The executives at Comcast should be tarred and feathered.
__label__1 After waiting on hold for more than 10 minutes, I spoke to a representative.  I explained that my OnDemand service was not working and pointed out that I have had to call every month because of service problems.  I asked to speak with someone with technical expertise or a person with decision-making authority.  I was told that a manager would call me within 30 minutes but no one ever called.I continue to pay for a service that simply does not work.  It is fraud or perhaps theft.  Comcast advertises a service and I pay for it.  More than 50 percent of the time that I try to access it, the service does not work.  I have made dozens of service calls and I have had more than a dozen technicians visit my home in a year and a half but the service still does not work.  I feel that Comcast is falsely advertising or perhaps committing fraud.  The company says that it can deliver a service.  A customer pays for the service, yet the service is not delivered.  I don't understand how they get away with this.
__label__1 We set up an appointment to have an HD/DVR box on Thursday, March 1st between 5PM-7PM. A technician came out who could barely speak English. After an hour of being on hold with dispatch, he attempted to install a box that did not work. He then attempted to install two other boxes that he had in his truck, but neither of them worked or could not be installed to my TV apparently because it was not HDMI-ready. I put the order in a week ago and informed Comcast of what cable box was needed and necessary for installation. After another hour of trying to communicate with dispatch, the technician informed me that he would be out the next evening to install a temporary box until the correct HD/DVR box became available. I also spoke to a supervisor on the phone who assured me that I would have a cable box the following night regardless.The following evening, we waited three hours for a technician to arrive, never received a call until the last hour from someone stating that there was no cable boxes available and he would not be able to make the appointment and then hung up. I called and spoke to seven different people and was on hold for two straight hours, most of them could not speak fluent English, to try to come to terms as to what the story was. All seven people could not assist me and basically told me that there was nothing they could do. I continued to call the following day to try to determine, after 20 years of service, why I was not getting any answers or assistance. I am a real estate agent and work with a lot of people. I have recommended Comcast for all my clients and renters. This will not be the case any longer. I am appalled at the level of bad service this company has shown during my particular situation and many, many other situations with my clients in the past. How difficult is it for a company as large as Comcast to communicate with their customers in a proper and more respectful way? Your assistance in this matter will be greatly appreciated!
__label__5 When I moved to my new apartment, I subscribed to the Performance internet promotion package (introductory price was good for 1 year). I did not want to rent the modem every month from Comcast so I purchased the modem on Amazon instead. When the technician came to set up my services, he noted on the paperwork that the modem installed was customer-owned.During the 1 year period, I did not have any problems with billing. But for some reason, on my 13th-14th month of service, after speaking to a Comcast account rep, she informed me that my bill would be increased an additional $7/month because I am renting a cable modem from Comcast. I informed her this is incorrect and that I have owned my own modem since I first became a subscriber. She stated she would submit a ticket to the warehouse and check my modem serial number against their database to make sure it wasn't one of theirs. A few days later, I receive a letter from Comcast informing me my monthly charges would be increased to correct for the equipment on rental.I call back 1.5 weeks later and the rental fee is still on my account and the ticket has not been resolved. Upon their suggestion, I fax over a copy of the receipt showing I purchased the modem, which clearly shows the modem was purchased almost a week before I started my services. Another week later, I call again and the charge still has not been removed. The rep assured me that someone is looking into it and to allow a few more days for processing. More than a month after my first call, I receive a 2nd identical letter. I called billing and the rep I spoke with said she would submit a ticket (again!) to have the issue looked into. At this point I was extremely irate that so much time had passed and the error still hadn't been corrected. It wasn't until I started raising my voice and stated that I would be canceling my services that the rental fee was finally removed. The rep credited my account for the rental fees accrued and immediately after this I disconnected my internet service with Comcast and had Verizon set up my service the next day.I looked online at other complaint boards and apparently misbilling for a customer-owned modem is pretty common practice for Comcast. Luckily Verizon Fios doesn't require a modem and they even provide the wireless router for free.
__label__1 I called in this morning and got a recorded message that there was an outage in the area. I didn't have internet access all day. That night, I called in and although they got my modem online, all of a sudden, my router doesn't work. The rep said, she'd tell me how to connect my computer directly to the modem (sigh). I don't know how to do that! When I asked what caused the outage, she said that the "trouble ticket" had been closed and so, there was no way to find out what the issue was.I asked if I went to the local office if they could tell me. She assured me there was no way to find out what and why the outage occurred. My router is not "end of life" since it's only a year old. I want to know what the outage was and if there is any recourse to fixing my issue.
__label__1 I signed up for Comcast Security in December 2013, canceled in January 2014 within the 30 day period and my service was inactivated. Since then I have called to tell them that I am still being billed as recent as April 2, 2015 ($100+) a month for over 16 months. Confirmed today that my security services cannot be troubleshooted because they are inactive. Why have I paid over $1,600 for inactive service and continuing to pay because if I don't, all my other services will be disconnected as well and I need my internet so I have been forced to pay for the security service even though it has been inactive since January 2014 and confirmed again today with ** in Home Security Trouble Shooting Department that my security service is inactive but it remains on my bill. This service has been inactive since January 2014 as noted/recorded in several calls (over 75) made to Comcast through out 2014. I was also just told today that I do not qualify for the $100 gift card that was promised to me in January - April of 2014 for all of my inconveniences (after calling in threatening to cancel all services and switch over to AT&T) and being told as early as March 31, 2015 that I did qualify for it and it was in the mail. Comcast departments has purposely deceived me into paying for their services while knowing that I wanted to cancel the Xfinity Home Service over 16 months ago.
__label__1 I was promised to have 50 mbps download speed when I called to have the service a few month ago with an advertisement price. I then found out that I got 25mbps, unless I add money to upgrade. Later, I called to complain that I only got 5mbps every evening by using online speed test. My cable modem is brand new with docsis 3.0 requested by Comcast. One rep told me that I should get 25mbps. She sent a technician to my home. The technician told me that there is nothing he can help because there are too many people using the internet in our area (about 600-800). The internet is shared by everyone who is using the Comcast. I was supposed to receive 3 mbps up to 25. He also told me that he will not charge me the $70 service due to the customer service reps lack of the knowledge.A month later, I was charged the $70 service by my automatic payment. I called again. A rep told me that he will remove the $70 and upgrade my speed to 50 mbps without additional charge. He said that it would be effective in 20 minutes for me to have 50 mbps. Now a week later after I talked to the rep. I called Comcast again. The rep (name is Latoya) told me that she checked the conversation history, she found the notes to upgrade to 50 but never installed. I have to pay an additional fee to have upgrade. She didn't see any note about remove of $70. She said that the technician has to remove it and she has no way to find the technician. She said that she has a solution for me to upgrade to 50 by paying an extra. I rejected. I asked to talk to her supervisor. She said that my case is not qualify to escalate to supervisor. I feel that there is one lie by another from Comcast.
__label__1 Comcast Xfinity is the worst of the worst. Each time I need to call in about something, I constantly get the run-around: each person you talk to will each give you a completely different answer to the question you're asking. If you're not able to get your cable and Internet pricing lowered, hang up and call back to get someone else. It took me 6 different people to finally talk to someone who was able to give me a fair and cheap price for my service. When I have a technical problem and the person you start talking to sounds like an idiot, hang up. They probably are. You will end up wasting your time on this person only to have one of two things happen: 1. They hang up on you because they can't figure it out or 2. Will waste your time blabbing about everything you already told them was wrong and end up having to transfer you, in which your call gets dropped anyway. These people are terrible, this company is a joke. If AT&T services my building, you bet your butt I would switch to them. Ugh.
__label__5 Comcast is price gouging. They are consistently tell you misleading information from representative to the next. They are not keeping their end of the bargain and are very deceitful. They tell customers your bill will be one price and when you get it it's another ridiculous price with all kinds of charges. They tell customers you are getting a bundle package and yet they charge separate fees including late fees to each service. So is a bundle or not? Most importantly I'm most upset about feeling hopeless when one calls customer service. I mean are they noting the information on the computer? It's not fair, especially if one must commit to a 2-year contract but they are not meeting their customer obligations! I was told my bill would be $109.00 per month including taxes. On the average my bill is anywhere from $122-166 per month. I don't get it!
__label__1 Moving from Washington State to the east coast, 1 week and 3 days later I lost all access to my email accounts. I was told this would continue for 30 days until a new address can be established. My job depends on these accounts and now no access. Talked to Comcast IT and he says he cannot get me access when the account is deactivated, asked how am I supposed to be activated when I'm in transit?? Says there is a problem on their end but can't fix it. I'm basically screwed and no job confirmation because of no email access! 3 other moves and never had a problem. IT just kept going around in circles with no results. Extremely upset about this and not getting any help from Comcast. Will not be using them again.
__label__1 I am EXTREMELY angry with comcast. Re: customer service with my issue of constantly losing my internet connection. After spending over an hour texting with a rep. (because you can't get someone on the phone), my problem was not resolved and I was given a Quick Resolution Ticket # and did not get a response until 72 hours later. Then, this rep. sounded as though she was having her lunch and was smacking in my ear. This one reiterated by problem, told me what the causes could be and suggested that I make an appointment for a technician. I THOUGHT THIS CALL WAS TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR A TECHNICIAN TO COME OUT!!! I continue to experience losing connection and will probably just look into another internet provider. I cannot believe the horrible customer relations when they charge such outrageous prices for this substandard service!
__label__1 I have reported this problem to Comcast via email and with their customer service. Regardless of the fact that I have checked the little box that is supposed to "keep me signed in" to my internet account for 30 days at a time, I am still forced to sign on average 4 times per day just to get my email. Customer Service stated they would send a Tech out to my home. I made the appointment. When I received the confirmation email for the appointment, it made it very CLEAR that I would be billed for this service! I cancelled the appointment immediately. I cannot believe I pay for internet/email service that DOES NOT PERFORM to this company's specifications. Setting up these bogus tech appointments is just another way to reach into the customer's pocket! Funny that this problem started to happen at exactly the same time that I had called Comcast about their monthly bill notification email. Every month, I would receive an email that stated "Your Bill is Ready". This email would be sent to me 7-8 days after I had just paid my previous bill! WTF? Totally annoying! So I called Comcast and told them to STOP sending these email notifications. It was right at that time I found myself having to constantly login to get my email. BTW, I will NOT set up auto pay with this Crap Xfinity/Comcast Company because I don't trust them one iota, i.e., I DO NOT want them to have free reign with my bank account. I need to get set up with a new ISP ASAP!
__label__1 BE PREPARED WHEN CALLING COMCAST: After long waits, they will shift you from extension to extension and suddenly it gets disconnected! For four consecutive months I tried to get a refund for extra charges that appeared on my bill, reps always said it was done and I would receive a credit which never happened. This took me to browse AT&T and found that the high speed internet and phone line that I have would cost me 3 times less! When I tried to cancel Comcast, it was almost impossible to cancel!
__label__1 Comcast is the worst company I have had the opportunity to deal with. I have called to disconnect my account with them several times over the past few months and still charged me for services I didn't use. I have had dishNET since December but Comcast charged me until February! It's Crap and that company should be brought down for fraud!
__label__1 Almost every time I turn on my wireless, my preferred SSID is highjacked by Xfinity. I am absolutely sick of it. Their aggressive sales and promotion practices are disgusting! I am tired of Xfinity coming up on my wireless every time I turn it on. There appears to be no way to stop it. I want nothing to do with Xfinity and they can't seem to get that. Their customer service is some of the worst I've encountered. GO AWAY XFINITY. You are not wanted and your bad customer service and aggressive sales tactics do not impress me or anyone I know.
__label__1 I recently moved into a new place with my fiance and we needed cable and WiFi service and we chose Comcast. In the almost 5 months having Comcast I quickly cancelled my phone and cable package and switched to their super speed WiFi only, and I'll start giving you the facts as follows... it is very hard for me to type these for the rest of this will be without proper grammar. It was ok within itself to get contact Service Friday even installed when she barely two cable boxes and Service and you have to call them before three different time. The original court order the service my second call was a good week. After 2 weeks it will have received two cable boxes and the Triple Play package that they offered I was told "Yeah that was the case." One day actually came to install my service I only receive one cable box which time I called them to ask why I was minus one cable box to which I was told that I had only ordered one. This was clearly not correct.Afternoon it's worth of Service I decided to give it up the Triple Play and stick with just the super speed wifi. Shortly thereafter I called to complain about my WiFi service which was not up to this speed ever of which they said I was getting my pay for said Service. They sent outsend test my wifi speed how to make sure that my WiFi service what is indeed working properly. It was not working properly and the technician switched out my router for a better one. I was told there was two WiFi options I could use and down was instructed when one was performing poorly to switch. In our home we have 6 total objects connected to the WiFi service but generally only two of those at a time. Still at this point I was not getting the numbers I was told I was going to get as far as WiFi capability. I called and complain - they switched my Service and credited me $20. Gave me some cable channels but that's not what I wanted.So I call back and complain about the WiFi service yet again. The technician I spoke to tested it from their end and I was correct - it was not performing properly so an appointment was made to send someone out yet again today. That young man came out, switched the router, told me there were two - I could use one was for my smart TV and my laptop, the other for my phone and Roku. Till now I can only connect to that which she told me to connect my phone to the other one is not operating properly and when I called to complain about all of it yet again to a supervisor I was told I would get a $30 credit.Not only why they not want to do anything else but I was also told that on average my home uses more than double data usage than most home which I find very hard to believe. I am currently going to seek out some other form what company to help me and once my bill is paid I will get rid of Comcast for good although their customer service reps are very courteous and polite. I was in customer service for over 19 years and it's not just about being courteous and polite but also the service that you offer should be up to par and if it's not it should be corrected. None of which I received from Comcast Xfinity. I do not recommend them to anybody and I think that they are waste of time and money.
__label__1 I signed up for Comcast TV and Internet package for 6 months and I called and cancelled the TV portion and kept the internet in March of 2013. Well, the TV was never taken off my account and I was charged for 2 months of TV service that I never used at $145+. On top of that, our internet wants to work when it feels like it. Our cell phone bills have been double b/c we are being charged for data usage when we think we are connected to WiFi in our townhouse. I called the customer service line and was put on hold for 45 minutes. Then I asked to speak with someone that could maybe troubleshoot our internet issues. The guys told me that Comcast doesn't provide the Modem when internet is installed so now I have a modem that was broken from the beginning. I opened my bill for this month and mind you, I should only be charged around $70 for just the internet and my bill was $304.45... I was LIVID. I called the service number back again and asked to speak to a supervisor... I was put on hold for over an hour and then they said they would call me back within two hours. I never got a phone call. I called again the following day and was put on hold for 38 minutes and was told the same thing, someone would call me back. So with the amount of frustration I had, I just hung up. I finally contacted someone in the corporate office and I do have to say they were very helpful. I know how important customer service is. Speaking from experience, I just cannot believe how horrible the service is at Comcast. So today, I am cancelling my account and I'm not paying my last bill.
__label__1 Comcast charge me $15 for TV I never used. I don't have TV box. Why change monthly fee to TV. They increase my internet every year. Why...
__label__1 In a single year, I have not had a full month of service.  Yet, I have been charged for modem rentals (when I use my own modem) and multiple cable boxes that have yet to work for more than 1 day after being replaced.  I was also charged for additional outlets that do not work and on demand shows that were ordered by a house guest after getting Comcast to release my password etc.  I also have been credited for no service, only to be recharged the next month.  I still do not have the services that I ordered a year ago.  I am too exhausted to continue to complain with no results.I have tried to work with customer service.  I've been charged for techs coming to fix their own issues.  And I have been accused of not being honest about my service not working, even after a technician could testify that I was without service.  I have no choice but to terminate my services with Comcast, as it has come to the point that I cannot trust them.  I now have a huge past due bill, with credits being removed from the previous month.  I also am down to one TV with service. 
__label__1 Yet again I've experienced horrible Comcast customer service. (again and again and again) I was online with a very helpful tech for 2 hours trying to resolve an issue (got bounced to several people and finally ended up with the helpful tech) and the chat got disconnected. I told him/her that my computer gave me a signal that the chat would disconnect if I did what they wanted me to do. They said no they would not be disconnected, but yes they were. They were given a phone number when the chat started but no call and I have no way to contact the tech which means I have to start the discussion all over with a new person. You would think given the fact that I said i think I might lose you they would have called me on the number they were given. I'm trying to connect online to watch the Olympics. Guess that's not going to happen. Because I don't have 2 hours to start over. I was trying to watch people I actually know compete. As usual you can't count on Comcast. I have no choice but to use them in DC, so they don't have to provide any service.
__label__5 My monthly bill went from $114.95 to $191 and despite two calls to Comcast, I cannot get a straight answer other than "We are sending a copy of the bill." I was also hung up on after being on hold for 17 minutes. What is happening to this company? I have paid bills on time for years. I just got a Fios promo in the mail. I wonder if they are better than this kind of treatment.
__label__0 This relates to attempting to disconnect service when I moved out of state.    In Early February, I called to cancel my internet account effective FEBRUARY 22, 2008.   Then I got a bill and called, because I had called to cancel, but was being charged.  I moved out of the house on February 22, 2008.  I expained this to the person with whom I spoke.  She told me don't worry.   She said they had recorded the disconnect with the February 22 effective date, but had not yet sent someone to the physical address yet to disconnect the service.  However, my Incorrect billing would be fixed as soon as THEIR TECHNICIANS went to do thier job!  I thought the issue had been resolved.  Appearently not.  Because  TODAY I got a NASTY & AGGRESSIVE voice mail message demanding I call to arrange to disconnect my service as new owners wanted to set-up their internet.  I HAD CANCELLED ALREADY!!  I called a SECOND TIME was told A SECOND TIME it would be addressed.  Instead I got hostility and still am being charged for services cancelled in a home I no longer own!  My decision now is not to use Comcast for either cable or internet here in Seattle.  Hopefully they won't screw with my credit.  However, as I have a bill with a past due (again for services twice cancelled in a home I no longer own) I don't put anything past them! I expect I will bet a hit on my credit report for not paying for service in a home I don't own.  Mostly, the consequence to date is frustration and hours of stress.
__label__0 I signed on to be a Comcast Customer to get the triple play<<"Internet, TV, Phone". I was unable to get the triple play because the wiring in the building is bad. The only thing that I was able to get was just the cable and even the cable did not work right. The on demand feature came in all distorted and broken up. And whenever there was bad weather the cable would break up as well. I saw an ad from Comcast that they are promoting basic cable services $10 a month for 6 months. And yet, we have been stuck with pathetic service, and my next door neighbor in the apartment next to me gets the triple play and everything else. Why can't we? And we are being left with $200 Bill or more for services that were never rendered. This is unfair and unjust. With the Conversion to Digital in a few weeks, we are stuck with the signal that is coming off the soon to be extinct antenna on the roof. Something has to be done with this. Please can you help?
__label__1 We have had Comcast Internet for years.  We moved locally and decided to go with Comcast TV instead of Dish Network.  We had the Internet service transferred to our new location and added TV on May 26, 2011.  When speaking to the customer service representative in placing our order, we were told our total costs for TV would be $89.99 a month, inclusive of everything.  She also guaranteed us a 30-day no-charge if we decided to cancel.  Sounded good.  After moving and watching Comcast TV, we did not like it.  You had to jump all over the place to obtain the channels we were used to watching.  We reinstated Dish Network, just love it, and cancelled the TV service on June 7, 2011.  The Comcast tech disconnected the TV service on June 8, 2011.  When we received our first bill, it was in the amount of $316.49.  We almost had a heart attack.  We were charged for the TV  double play promotion in the amount of $89.99, then $6.95 for sports package (which we thought was included, according to the service rep), $15.95 for additional outlet service, $9.95 for HD DVR service, modem Rental of $7.00, A/O Same Trip (3@$19.95 each, what ever this is) for a total of $59.85, Transfer from Account to new account of $49.98, Installation of $39.95, installation fee discount of $29.95, taxes, surcharges and fees of $6.92, for a total of $316.49.  Over the past two months, I have contacted Comcast customer service both by phone and online.  I have talked with over 20 people.  Some could not explain the bill, some told me they had no record of our disconnect, and others told me that everything was being taken care of, all the charges connected to the TV cancellation would take two-three months to come off our bill.  Our Internet was being deducted from our checking account, as we had always had done.  The last person I spoke to was Robb on July 11, 2011.  Robb is in billing and he assured me that all payments for our Internet service had been debited from our checking account and we were up-to-date on all Internet payments.Today, I have no Internet.  I started at 7:45 a.m. calling Comcast.  I spoke to five different people, being transferred, waiting, etc.  Finally I reached a man who explained to me that we owed $303 for Internet charges from May 1, 2011 plus service charges.  Non payment is the reason our Internet was disconnected.  My fault, I did not check my back account more closely.  Nevertheless, as stated above, I spoke to more than 20 people over the past two months regarding my bill, and all told me everything was OK.   I discovered, in speaking with this customer rep, that we were being charged for Internet service (OK, I will pay for this, and would have all along), plus service calls and account transfer.  The account transfer fee we had deleted from our bill with one of the customer reps somewhere along the past two months.  I was told this was to establish a new account.  New account--$49.98 to establish a new account!  This rep gave me credit at that time, but this rep I spoke to today stated this credit should never have happened.  He explained that we now have a new account number.  Whoopee, $49.98 for someone to give us a new number.  We were the same customers, same people.  I told him this was robbery. He left this credit alone but let me know repeatedly that I was receiving this credit when I should not have.  When I questioned the service call, I was told it was to fix our Internet.  When the service rep came out to install the TV service on June 8, 2011, he messed with our Internet service and our Internet later stopped working.  The service call from Comcast the next day was because of this.   I told him I refused to pay for service that was Comcast's fault.  After over two hours on the phone, I received a deduction in the amount of $71.93, and paid my Internet account up to date.  I suggested to this rep that he speak to his supervisor and mandate that whenever a rep speaks on the phone to any customer, that the conversation be documented under that customer's account number, so other reps can have the history of the problems.  This rep said this is supposed to be done but a lot of reps just don't do it.  So I have been over two months on the phone with Comcast just to resolve an issue I was told was taken care of.  Something needs to be done, as this company has the "GOD" syndrome.  We in Martinsburg, WV, do not have many choices for high-speed Internet; therefore, we are at their mercy.  Their prices are way too high.  They tell you one thing and then charge you complete different.  If anyone can help the public with excessive charges, please do so.  Forty-nine dollars and 98 cents to change account numbers!
__label__1 A Comcast tech came to my home to investigate an outage. While on the outside of my home and out of sight of myself or members of my family, the rep was working on the box and both the TVs in my home started to sizzle and smoke. My girlfriend went outside to investigate, while the rep rushed to the door, said that nothing was his fault and then left. Upon reviewing the damage, I lost 2 TVs, the washer and dryer, the stove and fridge to this incident. 24 hrs later and plenty of time spent on the phone with Comcast, they say that the rep said there was a voltage issue. With that, I contacted my electrical company to investigate. They made a few minor repairs but said the tech grounded a wire that wasn't supposed to be grounded and that was what caused the issue. So in trying to contact Comcast again, I have been confronted with not being able to reach a rep over the phone. It keeps saying my call can't be connected but I sat with a friend that has Comcast and let them go through the prompts and was able to reach a rep just fine. What do I need to do because this is flat out wrong? They shouldn't take the word of a shady tech that wouldn't stay behind to fix his mess or take the time to properly investigate what happened. My 23-mo.-old child won't play in his room by himself anymore. Anytime we walk past his room, he just repeats, "Fire, fire, fire!" This is inhuman and I will not rest until they fix the damage they have done.
__label__0 A year later, after being totally frustrated I contacted Comcast Cable Service again and told them I wanted a refund for the year of cable that I paid for and never received.  They told me they were only going to refund me for two weeks.  I am completely frustrated with Comcast because they do not have quality service providers that install the product and fix the product nor do they have professional customer service representatives that know how to handle the situation.  I want a refund and a service provider that KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO INSTALL MY CABLE BOX CORRECTLY.  IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR.
__label__1 Had Dish Network for 15 years and had to switch to Comcast for tv. Horrible customer service, the lack of communication with the sales dept to the service technicians is ridiculous and non existent. Took two weeks to even get two tvs working, now they sent out a technician to do our remaining 5 tv's and he knew nothing about what we needed done. Worst experience ever.
__label__1 I have been trying to access my emails as of late and everything is saying server is not responding, yet I can go into the website and access things there after jumping through hoops to get in. Yesterday as of this date I spoke to a so-called customer service rep and asked why everything was down. I was told they changed security settings and reset everyone's account. I asked if they notified everyone and he said no. No! This is the stuff that makes Comcast service the worst, but unfortunately they are the 800-lb. gorilla on the block and you have no other choice but to go through them or else have no service in my area. And you watch they are still going to charge us for the downtime even though we did not get what we pay for. To date I still cannot get my emails though my mobile phone or have to keep entering my account information on my PC at home every time I want to check it. Unsatisfactory! We don't need attorneys to talk to us, we need somebody to jump down on these thieves and get this stuff corrected now!
__label__0 I ordered cable Internet service from Comcast on May 2nd. I knew I would be one of the first people in my market to get the service because it had not been available previously. I was sent a self installation kit as I requested, but then received a call saying that Self installation was not supported in Detroit, and I'd need an appointment to have an installer come out. So I promptly cancelled my service that day. Then I finally got a call from someone who actually works for Comcast in Detroit. He told me I never should have been sold a modem in the beginning of May, and that they are still going through detroit upgrading the equipment in some neighborhoods. Why doesn't anyone selling the modems know this? Why have they wasted ao much of my time? There's not one person at Comcast that has any clue what anyone else is doing. The national call center, which is where all calls for technical assistance are directed, is completely useless. They don't knoe what's going on in most local areas. Unfortunately for me, like many others, Comcast is the only choice for cable internet in my area.
__label__1 I never had any cable services with Comcast.  I disconnected my internet services 8 months ago, and cleared all statements.  I used my own equipment.  After 8 months, I received charges on statement for not returning cable box.  The customer care was able to verify that I never had any cable services.  Still, they kept asking me to either pay or return the cable box.  Comcast has no common sense.  I would definitely like to get help for this if someone knows.
__label__0    In January 2006, a service technician came to my home and wrongly communicated to his office that I had HD/DVR converter box that I didnt have.  I was unaware of this and continued to pay the monthly bill without fully reviewing the details because I had no reason to question the monthly bill.  In July 2008 another service technician came to switch out a converter box that no longer worked and at that time he informed me that I was being charged for an upgraded box that I didn't have!  Yes, thats right I was being charged for the HD/DVR converter box.  I immediately contacted Comcast to get the matter straightened out and was told that I would receive a credit for 6 months on the HD/DVR box.  The representative at that time went on to explain that because so much time had transpired (2006 to 2008) Comcast couldn't go back and make an adjustment to the original date of the upgrade, but instead would offer me the converter box free for one year.  I reluctantly agreed and continued to pay the bill.  I just looked at the bill for November and realized that Comcast has continued to bill me for the converter box all along.  I feel that this situation should be investigated because I've been paying for a product/service that was not provided and the promise to make good on the overcharge was never honored.  I have called Comcast three times in the past week and given the run around.  Now as I write this, I'm trying to get this situation resolved, but I don't feel confident that Comcast can be trusted to correct this wrong on their own.  A week ago I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told none were available - the representative took my daytime number and promised that I would receive a call the next day.  I'm still waiting.  Every time I call about this situation, I'm forced to start from the beginning which leads me to believe there is a great deal of inefficiency regarding Comcast's ability to correct it's own errors.  In the meantime, the rates have gone up and they continue to charge me for a box that was not in my possession for almost two years!  I hope that you will find this important enough to investigate as I find it hard to believe that I'm the only one to have this particular problem with Comcast.  
As I mentioned, Im writing this as I attempt to get this situation resolved and the representative I was speaking with (Rebecca) insisted that I didnt know what I was talking about and then responded by hanging up in my face!  I would really ask that you look into this matter.Thank you and I anticipate your response.I immediately contacted Comcast to get the matter straightened out and was told that I would receive a credit for 6 months on the HD/DVR box.

__label__1 I was using Dish Network and AT&T for TV and internet service respectively when a Comcast rep showed up and offered me a deal in mid-July 2013. This deal had everything included (phone, internet, and TV) for $109.00 a month with a 90-day grace period. I was hesitant to accept, but decided to try it for few days, so I did not disconnect my services from Dish and AT&T.In the second week of August, I had to admit to a hospital and had to spend 16 days in the hospital. When I returned home, I noticed that my Internet, phone, and TV services had been disconnected. When I called Comcast, I found out that they discontinued the service in 30 days, because I did not pay my bills. I informed them that I have intention of continuation of service and also mentioned about the 90-day grace period.Then I got Dish Network and AT&T service connected, but Comcast did not release my phone number. It took about 20 more days to get the phone number ported back to AT&T. During this period, I received an invoice of $371.00 for their service. I called the billing department of Comcast who promised to adjust it. It did not happen. Then I drove to the Comcast service location with the contract showing the 90-day grace period to request them to correct my account. I continued to receive invoices, so I wrote a letter explaining what happened. Nothing changed. I received the fourth invoice three weeks ago. Then yesterday (12/07/2013), I received a letter from a collection agency for this $371.00 offering me nothing.I am annoyed and it bothered me so much that I could not sleep well the whole night yesterday. I exhausted all my options trying to get Comcast adjust their billing system. I question myself, "Where are those consumer protection agencies when a company like Comcast can trouble so many customers like me who pays bills in time and wants to live peacefully?"
__label__1 I canceled my service because we moved away. We only used one week service for that month. We returned the equipment the next day after calling to cancel. That was mid July 2015. Two months later, I called to follow up with them because I never see a check from Comcast. The agent said she will start to process the refund and I will receive in 4-6 weeks. It never happened. Today I called again, I was told that it was never processed. The agent said he is processing now. I asked him, "Should I call back in 5-6 weeks?" He said "Yes, please do". For only one week usage of that month, I am going to receive 1/3 of monthly payment as refund; my time is worth more money than dealing with them. To me, this is Comcast's strategy that they make you to beg and beg. Honestly I don't know if they are going to refund at all. I am giving up, for sure. I will never, ever use them again. With today's technology, we don't really have to have Comcast.
__label__1 Here is a copy of a letter that I sent to Comcast. Needless to say, their actions prove they could care less: This letter is to notify and follow up on my unsatisfactory experience with Comcast on or about March 15th, 2013 regarding a problem I had with an installation contractor that came to my home to install my service. To start, the contractor had gotten the wrong address and contact number for my account and called a relative of mine that is in no way shape or form associated with my account. The contractor then finally called me and I advised him of my correct address. Apparently, the representative that set up my appointment entered the wrong building number. This issue resulted in an hour plus delay in my installation, since I was told they now had to create a new account since they were not able to correct the previous accounts address. After going through all the confusion with the account address and information, I find out the contractor that came did not have a valid Comcast ID (his ID was expired) so my apartment complex would not provide him access to the area required to install service. The contractor came into my home as if it was his own. He sat on my couch, turned my television on and advised he does not get paid unless the job is completed and he will be staying to wait on his supervisor since he would not be paid unless the service was installed. So the contractor attempted to complete install without going into the authorized room which caused damage to my wall in my apartment. During this time, four to five hours had passed, he reaches out to his supervisor and manager for assistance. They too did not have valid Comcast IDs (also expired) and were denied access as well. After being informed that neither the representative nor his management staff had current IDs, I contacted Comcast customer service department. They then escalated the situation and advised a supervisor would call me back. I eventually got a call from Sam ** who later I found out was a field manager for the technicians. Sam advised me of his outrage with my situation and assured me this was not Comcast normal practices and you take these situations very seriously and advised he would seek corrective action with the Contract company, then he would take care of me and compensate me for such a potentially dangerous situation. Sam advised me that he would provide me with six months of free service and all I would need to do is call him when I received my bill and he would credit the account in full. Sam advised that he would need to wait for my services to be installed before he would be able to issues in credits on my account, advising that he was not in customer service and would not be allowed to issue the credits until then. He provided me with this contact number ** and advised me to reach out to him if I need further assistance or have any other issues. Had Sam not offered this as compensation, I would have never installed the service and would have sent a complaint such as this to address the issue and gone with another provider. I am dissatisfied with your customer service because Sam never followed through with his promise. When I reviewed my 1st bill and called Sam, he advised he would take care of it. When I received my second bill, there was a credit but there was still a balance due. I called Sam again regarding the issue. He advised that he would take care of it and complete the full credit for my account. Unfortunately, the same issue was present the third month in May. I then received a collection notice regarding the non-payment of the past due amount. I called, let him know that I was upset regarding the collections notice because he promised me free service. Sam advised he would take care of it and complete the full credit for my account but I would need to pay my pay per view charges of about $7. I then called collections and advised them of the situation and I would be only paying for the movie order and that a manager was working to credit the rest of the charges. Later, I received another collections letter regarding my service with a large past due balance. I then reached out to Sam several times regarding the issue and left several voicemails expressing how upset I was that he did not follow through with his promise to me which was the only reason I continued with the installation and set up another appointment with him for service. I have attempted to resolve this problem by reaching out to Sam ** directly. After several failed attempts to reach Sam, I reached out to customer service and that experience made an already difficult situation worse. I'm very understanding to call center practices since I work in that same environment daily for Verizon Corporate. This is also why the horrible service I received continues to baffle me. There was no assurance of help in resolving my issue. Every time I called and spoke with a different department, they advised that they cannot handle the situation and were not authorized to issue such a large credit. I have failed to come across a representative that has owned the issue to ensure resolution. I called in and spoke with a representative by the name of Mary the week of July 22nd. Mary escalated my issue to her supervisor, ensured me they would follow up on the issues and send a direct email to Mr. ** requesting him to contact me and that they would follow up with me Monday evening to see what the results were. I advised them I did not believe Mr. ** would call me since he has failed to return any of my previous calls to him. Lo and behold, Mr. ** never called me that Monday, July 29th. I advised Mary of that when she called to follow-up. Then to my surprise, Mary advised Mr. ** never replied to her supervisor's email and there was nothing else that she could/they could do since Mr. ** failed to respond to the supervisor's email or return my call. I requested to speak with her supervisor again. Mary then advised that he was out of the office for the day. I requested her to have him call me the following day, which never happen. I attempted to call the Supervisor on the number he called me from previously, 410-248-2600, and got a message that the number is not a working number. This is very disappointing because in the beginning, they offered me the assurance of help and they guaranteed a follow up. So I called in again today to the collections department to advise them again of the issues I'm having with my account. I spoke with a very understanding representative named Devonte who advised that he saw everything I stated to him about this issue on the account noted from the day the service started. When his supervisor Jennifer got on the line, she was not very helpful and was not willing to own the issue to ensure resolution. She stated she did not have authorization to issue the credit on the account, so I asked her who could. Jennifer did not provide the requested information but continued to state she was not authorized to issue that credit. I then began to go into detail in regards to my unpleasant experience stating that this could not be legal. Then Jennifer transferred without my knowledge to the legal department without explanation. I then was on the line with a legal representative by the name of Mike. I advised that I was not sure why I was transferred to him and I let him know I was upset. Mike then disconnected the call. To be hung up on after 55 min of being on hold and being transferred against my will, I have to say my experience with Comcast thus far in my option is the definition of horrible service from start to finish. It's also sad to say that this seems to be standard practice based on my own experience with Comcast. During my several calls to the service center, I've been hung up on several times. I hope there is integrity within your company and that you will honor what was promised to me. So you can see why I am upset. I spoke with someone at Comcast in customer relations after this who said he would issue the credits promised but was not be able to issue any credits for the additional inconvenience of getting the credits issued. Turned out he lied like everyone else and never fully credited the original promised credit to the account. The complete opposite of what was discussed via our emails and phone conversation. I will submit this complaint to every possible outlet. I see no integrity at Comcast at all.
__label__5 Comcast has not provided the service they promise. I purchased a 100mb/sec internet plan and have not received consistent service since going with Comcast in 2008. Constant data hits (which they can't seem to detect) and, when calling to find out what the problem is, their response: "We don't see any problems from our end." "We can send a technician out, but you'll be charged a service fee if a problem is not found". Well, of course they aren't going to find a problem, because the problem is on their end. They oversell their servers and their data transmission lines become inundated and the flow is inhibited. Comcast relieves themselves of this responsibility because they use third party resources as a transfer medium. I am done with Comcast and will NEVER go back. I'll pay my 211.00 early termination fee, turn their box back in and be done.
__label__0 I have had comcast cable for years for tv, it has been ok.  I used to have Roadrunner cable (which was great), until Comcast bought them out.  Then immediately, they capped the bandwidth down to almost nothing.  They slowly have been bringing back up to an acceptable level.  However...they are so misleading and dishonest.  I pay extra for their higher tier internet service.  Do I get? Of course not!  They recently upped their internet bandwidth to 16 Megs downstream and 2 megs upstream.  Do I get that? Ha!  They tell you to go to Speak-ezy and do a speed test, but what they don't tell you is, that speed test is worthless, since they have this misleading thing called speedboost.  What speedboost does it DOUBBLES your bandwidth for a few seconds, then it adjusts to what you are really getting. I have NEVER gotten what they promised.  I have had techs out almost once a week, and they tell is it's acceptable.  I said to the one that was out today, I'm only getting 8 megs, i'm paying for the 16 meg service.  He actually told me, well 8 megs is acceptable, i'd be very happy with that.  AT which point I said, I'm paying for 16 megs and I was told I'd get 16 meg service!  Again he said, well we say UP TO 16 megs.  So they can give you 2 meg service, (which is what i was getting last night), and they are still within their legal rights.  There is NO WAY they can give 16 megs service to those houses.  They can't even give 8 meg service...they have to take the two leads and split them several times to give service period.They talked me into their stupid digital phone service. So I finally took the bate after being hounded to death.  ONly a few days after I accepted it, the power went out, and we lost all services.  Why?  because they didn't have a backup generator on our node.  Now my phone service is not $33 a month as they advertised, but now it's $36 a month, because again fail to tell you they have to charge you for a modem fee too.  I had already bought and was using my modem for my cable tv and internet.  So now to get my internet speed back up, they have to come and put my modem back in for the internet and leave their modem for the phones and tv.  Well it means again, loss of signal because they have to split the signal from their modem to mine.  I can't wait until Fibreoptics are in here, i'll be gone like the wind.
__label__1 My computer was not working.  I called Comcast and the man talked me into this program for $98.95 that could do miracles for me and my computer, and have it running like brand new.  After he took my money, he sent me to someone else who could not help me and said, Youre going to have to call and order the $150 program where they come to your house. I cant help you.  I called back in the morning and got a hold of someone who tried to help again and logged into my computer and said nothing was wrong!  I told him it does it off and on.  He didnt clean up and all the good things I was told from the man who sold it to me.As soon as we got off the phone, I called Comcast that morning and told them to cancel this service.  It was no help to me and I wanted my money back.  I was told no problem.  The computer started doing the same exact things it was doing before he looked at it!  I bought a new computer.  On 11/18, I had Comcast install it.  So, they clearly should have seen it was not fixed!  I called today and this lady Angie only wanted to argue that because he logged in, I could not get my money back.  He was in there around 10 minutes and got out.  The problem was not fixed.  It did the same thing later.  I want my $98.95 back from Comcast for poor representation of their products and for not doing what their seller told me who got me to sign up.  False seller tactics were used to screw people like me over.  Please help me.  I am on disability and I cant afford to throw my money away like this.  Thank you so much for your help!
__label__0 I am upset about company harassing me about a non-issue from the past. I have used Comcast for many years and all of my families as well. One of your employees gave me my prepaid monthly fee back because I was in good standing when I changed to another company. This change was due to losing a job. I had to cut back. This was in 2008. Later today, I rebutted this old charge (again) because my prepaid month was returned to me. That alone establishes that I was in good standing and I owed nothing monetarily. I was told Comcast would pick up the box. I was not working during that period. I was laid off. How can your company state that because Comcast stated they would pick it up, it is my fault? No, I did not make your employees pick up your box within a week. It is not my fault. This has been two years. I paid my bills or I would not have been refunded. I have requested Comcast to not harass me anymore. I have requested data from Knology to document when I started using Knology. P.B. There were no other applicable fees or charges. Documents will be provided to dictate and prove Knology start date at my home and how they scheduled appointments and did not show. I will make sure my family and friends know how they will be treated when they use Comcast. 
__label__1 Turned in my modem two months ago, still being billed by Comcast and they are sending my paid-off account to collections.
__label__0 I called Comcast because we were getting intermittent internet service. They sent a technician that indicated my modem was bad, and was replaced. The problem continued. I was still getting service only if I disconnected the cable from the back of the modem and replaced it. I called again, and a different technician came and diagnosed the problem being from outside and not the modem. The first technician has taken my modem as I did not  need it anymore. They sent a Comcast truck with a technician from Comcast. He indicated that there were several problems, and he replaced several items in the box outside. I called Comcast to get a credit for not having to use the service. They indicated they can only give credit for one month because there was intermittent service and there will be no credit for the modem. They are still charging me for the modem even though they have my personal modem.Basically, we did not use the service for over 4 months as what was indicated by the service person. Mr. Ron indicated they can see how much usage of the internet we had, but he will not provide me with that information. He further indicated that he will call other technicians and find out what has happened. He also indicated that they do not give credit for intermittent service even though it was the first technician that failed to diagnose the problem correctly, and gave me a modem that I did not need and charged me $7 per month for the modem.   
__label__1 My cable TV is now off. Comcast took 321$ out of my account and sent me a bill for 745$ when it was only 460$ to begin with. Came, got the boxes, it's still off. I called about four time being hung up on. What can I do about this. They just take people money and they equipment.
__label__1 I tried Comcast to save a few bucks, and boy, what a big mistake. All of their set top boxes are heavily used. I should know, I ended up getting nine units because they kept on failing (what A hassle having the technician come to my house to replace these). When watching someone speak on TV, the voice lags behind the lip movement. They told me my TV was too advanced; the frame rate was too high (guess I should have saved my old TV). I noticed that the HD was not as clear as DIRECTV's, and found that Comcast's maximum is 720p, not 1080. Their DVR hardly holds any shows, they told me to get Xfinity, but then I found that all of this Xfinity features were not available in my area, and it would be a extra $20 (so much for saving a few bucks). When you call for a technician to come out and repair the set-top box, watch, because they will try to charge you for this. That was the last straw for me, when they try to charge me a second time for the technician to come out, and they refused to credit me on my bill (even when I talk to the manager, I got nowhere). All of this happened within a span of two months. What a fiasco!
__label__0 We are a small real estate business. We are unable to connect a tenant to Comcast, because they want to do upgrades here first. The previous tenant has service, but they refused to transfer this existing service without a construction upgrade. I am losing this tenant as a result. A small thing that turned into a big thing. They will not even return our calls.
__label__1 As usual they were suppose to come between 11-1. Go home from work at 11 and Comcast showed up at 2:20. Unacceptable.
__label__5 I've had Comcast for a number of years now and each year it gets worse and worse. You can be watching a movie or a football game and then all of the sudden you have nothing. If it's not that then the tv will start pixelating (those little digital squares that cover the screen). It seems every other week it is something. I have a 2 yr agreement and I will call, if I can get through, to cancel this agreement. It seems to me in order to hold you to an agreement they have an obligation to provide good service. At this point it is terrible.
__label__1 One year after moving in our bill jumped by about 30%, thus, as one might expect, my wife called and asked what specials, etc. The non-English-speaking person stumbled through numerous insanely confusing offers. My wife simply stated that we liked what we had, but did not like the pricing. She was told that another one year renewal would keep all channels as they were and yet maintain the old pricing. UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER PROMISES WERE TRUE! We lost half of the channels and the price did NOT go down. What a con. We called again today some months later and were told that the only way to get the Hallmark Channel (one of the many we lost) was to pay $40 more per month for the one channel!!! Comcast is a CONCast. We are moving in a month or so and I will NEVER go back to these cons again. BUYER BEWARE.
__label__1 I tried contacting Comcast/Xfinity's service phone number. The person who answered was unable to help and when I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told the wait time was 10 minutes. In the meantime I asked to speak to someone in the United States. He said he would give me the number of someone the the US (in other words, Comcast outsources their employees). When I called, it was the same recording! I called the first number back, and asked the gentleman with the thick accent where he was located. He hung up on me!
__label__1 We have scheduled 9 different appointments to get an upgraded package. This package we have now is bad. Comcast never can get it together. They never have the right equipment to install. The service we have now part of it does not work and we are constantly resetting. Talking to Comcast on the phone takes hours. The system is definitely flawed. Then people do not know what they are talking about. They tell you things that just are not true. Taking off work to come home and then they don't bring the right equipment or they don't ring the door bell. This mornings missed appointment for the 9th time is just too much.
__label__0 After years of having "less than basic" cable we decided to "upgrade. Big mistake! Leave well enough alone. After 3 trips out to our house where we have to wait around 4 hours for each visit, we still do not have a functioning "upgraded" cable. They've also managed to ** up the internet so we do not have internet service either. I would highly discourage anybody from signing up with Comcast. When I spoke to a supervisor about the first mistake, he simply offered, "That was the technician's error. He refused to credit my account or offer anything for the inconvenience. Boycott Comcast until they learn how to provide decent customer service!
__label__1 If you want a home Internet service, please do not pick Comcast for service. Why, they are a liar and cheat! I signed up home Internet from Comcast. They said there was $29.99 plus $10.00 for modem and its unlimited internet. Guess what, it cost me $134.99 month. Please be my advice, do not get hook Internet with Comcast, be smart ok.
__label__0    Comcast was initially supposed to set up service in my home on 9/5/09 but due to the line in need of repair, they told me they needed to come at a later date. They scheduled me for 9/11/09 from 2p-5p for repair & installation of services (cable, phone, & internet). Friday morning, I returned home around 11:30a to find that one of the Comcast subcontracted techs had left a voicemail to notify me that he was going to be late. I was not aware that anyone was supposed to come out before my scheduled 2p-5p appointment. Another rep. from Comcast called, about 30 min. after the tech., to inform me that the tech was going to be late & that there was no ETA. I called Comcast to find out what was going on & was informed that a pre-wiring was scheduled for 8a-11a. No one had notified me before & that a pre-wiring needed to be done nor that an appointment from 8a-11a had been scheduled. It would not have mattered anyway, however, because the tech was late anyway; almost 2 hours late! The employee from Comcast, Cody, came as scheduled at 2p to proceed with the installation of services, but informed me that the pre-wiring had not been done & that he could not proceed without it. He called his supervisor & the supervisor of the subcontracted techs. He installed a temporary pre-wire (which meant running a wire through my sliding glass door with it being cracked open, leaving my home unsecure). He installed it this way with the underst&ing that another pre-wiring tech would come out by 5:30p the same day to fix the wire & install it correctly as per Natanya in the Richmond Comcast office. I paid $183.95 installation fee as per Comcast policy under the good faith that the services would be complete that day. Well, I waited until 5:30p & no tech had come. I called Comcast &, of course, the local office was closed so I spoke with several people in different call centers who could not get in contact with Comcast dispatch. They sent several emails to Richmond concerning the situation but I did not hear from anyone, a supervisor, until almost 10p. He informed me that he had just received the email as he had been in the field all day. I told him I appreciated him calling me back but was thoroughly disgusted with the type of service I received & that I did not wish to have services with them anymore. He stated that he would check to see why the tech never came to do the pre-wiring & get back with me.  I would like to know why no one ever came to complete the services & why did they ask me to pay money for services they knew were not going to completed that day. I have yet to recieve an answer from the Richmond office as they are closed on the weekends apparently. Their subcontractors are goign to cause them to lose money & customers. They need to rescind the contract with that company & hire a company who is going to do the job they are paid to do.

__label__0     This new format for comcast is really  bad. It really doesn't work well at all.      Is there anyway  to use the old format for E-mail?  The nam is smart zone=bad   E-mails not complete, disappear and   screwey things that happen.
__label__1 We have internet and basic cable through Comcast. We have our payments set up for automatic withdrawal every month. The first problem is that the withdrawal amount is not the same each month. We have not ordered pay per view or other on demand services that have a fee so our service should be the same every month. They were unable to explain this and we do not get a statement each month that would help.My next compliant has to do with our current bill. I have it set up for automatic withdrawal every month and this past month, though our bank account shows that they with drew the funds for payment, they are claiming we did not pay. So now not only are they charging the fee for service again but they have added late fees, turned off the service, and now want another fee for reinstating our service. I specifically set up the automatic payment so this would not happen.My husband made a phone call to Comcast customer service and they were unwilling to resolve the issue over the phone. They said they would "investigate. They wanted us to pay the so called "past due amount" before they would turn our service on again. My husband has taken our bank statement to the local Comcast office to show the proof of payment. Our desire is that they will acknowledge the payment that was made (now twice), remove all the erroneous fees and restore our service. We would leave Comcast if we had another option.
__label__5 It usually takes a very long time to get someone on the phone & when we do get someone...they don't speak English and don't understand the problem. The problem is usually not resolved until a day or two later after the "cable box" or "internet modem" has been "reset" several times after several calls back. T.V. is usually fine. Internet speeds are variable and often very slow. Also, the cable provider opted us "in" to providing a free hotspot for the general public (at least for other XFINITY subscribers). That made our internet crawl! The installation process was very easy for cable. We tried to also have the phone installed, but it was too difficult so we had to stop that subscription. The internet was a self-setup. Each of our services goes down without warning at various times during the day in all kinds of weather. We're never given an explanation or a credit, even though it happens all the time. 
__label__1 By far, the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I have sent multiple emails to corporate with no response. I have had issues ongoing for over 2 years without resolve and Comcast has still not effectively credited my account. FURIOUS CUSTOMER here. I have been told for the last 2 years a credit would be applied backdated to the date the issues started, to the date of resolution and have received $60 worth of credit. For 2 years of bad service, I have lost a job and countless hours at my other job because of these issues and Comcast has yet to resolve the issues. I am beyond frustrated at this point as I have made countless phone calls and sent numerous emails. Clearly, nobody gives a **. I want this properly rectified and I want it done NOW. You can message me. I will post this on every social media forum I can find.
__label__0 I have had ongoing billing issues from beginning from being charged for free installation to not getting promotional offers and having late fees/disconnects while disputing charges. I found speaking on phone to customer service reps was pointless as things were never documented. I began dealing with customer escalation team when someone tweeted displeasure with Comcast. I had everything in writing. I was dealing with Melissa ***, who initially got things straightened out around Thanksgiving. I refused to speak with anyone on the phone because of previous history. I wanted it all in writing. I was still having issues with internet connectivity, so I emailed her on 1/7/10 advising her that my internet was down yet again. I was fed up and would be seeking alternate Internet service. I stated clearly that I wanted service canceled and would continue with my basic cable.No response. I sent another email on 1/20 detailing previous string. I expected to be credited for down service from previous period that I had paid for and expected any/all late charges, etc., to be credited. She referred a local rep "Saundra" to contact me. I advised her in writing again that I would not interact in any way outside of email so there would be no confusion. I was advised that Saundra would credit me accordingly and send a letter in confirmation. I received a letter the beginning of February that was vague and didn't make sense. There was no contact info other than a phone number. I was not communicating except in writing. I figured I would receive a bill that would break things down more clearly.I received the bill yesterday and saw that they had continued to bill be for internet service, plus late fees, in excess of $150 for the past three periods. I immediately emailed Melissa *** yet again detailing things and including the string showing I had clearly requested internet service be canceled and credited retroactively. I received no response. This afternoon, I was entertaining a lunch with my boyfriend, my mother, and his parents. This was the first time they were meeting and a Comcast rep comes to the door to collect $150 for late fees or he's disconnecting it immediately. Of course, everyone heard this. I told him I could show him emails detailing ongoing issues. He said no money, he was disconnecting, that there would be late fees, penalties, and reconnect fees. I will be pulling my credit reports Monday as I am sure they have also impacted my credit with these ongoing issues. (I am happy to forward the email strings documenting all of this).
__label__1 We were moving to another state and cancelled our service with Comcast. When I returned all of my equipment to the UPS store, I asked the clerk if I had handed in all equipment that they was registered to me. She stated that I had but to "keep your receipt because they will come back several months from now when you have lost or misplaced the receipt, and say that you had not returned everything, therefore you are not entitled to any refund you might have coming." She said it had happened many times. Therefore, I made sure and hold on the receipt. My husband called to be sure they had everything accounted for and that were we getting a receipt for services we did not receive since we had cancelled service. The lady at Comcast said, "Yes, all equipment had been returned and we were entitled to a $117 refund," which we would receive in 4-6 weeks.Long story short, it is now 16 weeks later and many many phone calls to see why we have not gotten our refund. There have been all kinds of excuses from, delay in processing the ticket, to just saying we don't know why... I spoke with a supervisor, Dave who assured us the check would be sent out in 5 business days. It has been 3 weeks since that conversation so tonight I called to see what was going on and was told, we did not return all of the equipment!This is a fabrication cut and dry, we have a receipt, which he says was for video equipment only (4 cable boxes). The most TVs we ever had in that house was 3. So the 4 pieces of equipment are actually 3 boxes and the modem. They are saying we did not return the modem so they are going to keep our $117. Exactly what the lady at UPS warned me about is what happened! This is a sorry company, dishonest and ruthless. I would rather not have tv than EVER use this company again. I am contacting a class action lawsuit lawyer tomorrow.
__label__1 I have been in queue for online chat with a customer service rep for 40+ minutes. I've been 1 in queue for 20 minutes. I chose online chat because I didn't want to get stuck on hold for an hour on the phone. I have one simple question--where is my self-service box that was scheduled to arrive 3 days ago? I can't get internet access without it.
__label__1 I signed on with Comcast in May 2016, and they assured me there were no hidden fees or costs and that my monthly cost was 54.99 plus taxes for my internet and basic TV. Since then every month my bill has gone up a few dollars at a time and now stands at 85.00. Their latest excuse is because I won't give them access to my bank account for direct deposit they had to increase my monthly charges by 10.00 dollars. It was understood from the beginning that I wanted a paper bill and I was told no problem with that. If this is what has happened in 4 months what happens after a year or 2. This is deceptive billing at its best and I would switch but there are other choices at my location.
__label__5 I signed up with a local Comcast company in Ventnor. I wanted to bundle cable and Internet. They signed me up and quoted me a price of 79.99. Over the phone they told me I would get basic cable Internet, free HBO and dvr service for this price. With the taxes, my bill is supposed to be 107.00 monthly. Now I am 2 months into this and I get a letter stating that they are going to raise my bill because the dvr service is not included in my package. So I called them and was told that I can either switch the boxes out and or pay the new price. Since I am not familiar with wiring things I asked if they could send someone to do this and the answer to that is yes but I have to pay for that as well. So my issues are... Why was the dvr system set upon installation if it was not included in the price that was quoted to me... And if I have to make the switch, why do I have to pay for the technician to come out when none of this is my error?
__label__1 In November of 2013 I received a letter from Comcast Informing me that as a result of cancelling the phone service portion of my bundle, I would now be charged $123.90 per month, plus taxes and fees, for my TV and internet service. Since I had been paying $135 per month through my bank's auto bill pay I didn't think twice about it. I would pay the same for two services that I originally paid for three. Felt I was being gouged but not a lot of choices in this area.I came home from work in March or April to find my service turned off (for probably the 3rd time in 10 months even though I auto pay through my bank. I was assuming that my kids were going nuts with the pay per view and didn't believe them when they said they weren't). I called to find out why I was so far behind and was told I owed over $100. I gave her my card number (I believe the past due was $117 and change) and asked her how when I was told in writing what the bill amount was: she told me they had no record of any such letter and therefore it didn't exist and that my bill was actually $166/month.Next, I was told that if I agreed to reinstate my home phone service, my bill would only be $135.90/month. I said that it was crazy that I was being charged more money for less service and that adding the phone brought my bill DOWN. She said that that was how bundling worked. I thought this was ludicrous but I agreed to the terms, got my new phone number (**), and changed the monthly auto pay amount to $145.00. I wrote the confirmation number down and said goodbye.As of August 11th I am again over $100 in arrears. I went to my local Comcast office, told them the problem, showed them the letter, told of the phone call with the confirmation number and was told that that phone call amount was also wrong and the Rep never processed the order. The Rep at the office offered to allow me to pay my past due and assured me that there was no one else for me to talk to about this matter: she was it! Her way or no way. I said thank you and left. I don't know where to turn to fix this. I have paid $1330 since December 2013 for basic cable, no DVR, no movie channels, 4 TVs with the small converter boxes (1.99/month each) and internet access and while I am being given a billing amount, my bill is never for that amount. It all seems so dishonest and I am tired of paying up for their customer service mistakes.
__label__0 Comcast had sent 2 men to my home on June 3, 2008. When the men arrived they accused me of stealing cable. mind you I had been a customer of there's for over 4 years.  The men pushed their way into my home and began searching my home, all rooms, even basement which is unfinished. I asked them to leave and that they had no business being there or searching my home. They said that If I bothered them again then they were going to disconnct my service. After they left I telephoned comcast, they said they had no work order to even be at my home, there wasno proof that they were ever at my home. I said I could describe the men, they said due to company policy they were unable to offer that as a solution. The following day comcast re appeared at my home to fix a cable box outside, apparently that is the only reason they were ever dispatched to my home. I never had a work order through them. Not only did the tresspass, they threatened me and my family, forced entry and was very ignorant. comcast has been playing cat and mouse with me since to settle on a resolution to this event. In my opinion watch out, comcast is a untrustworthy company to do business with and they have no problem breaking the law. 
__label__1 On Sundays, my internet speed drops to 2.2 download and 1.4 upload according to Speedtest.net. The rest of the week I am usually in the +20 download, +6.5 upload. Comcast's poor customer phone service routed through the Philippines always insists it is my equipment. US management agreed to run a test the day of the problem the next time I called, but you cannot get that message through their inept specialists overseas that answer the calls. How can you pay more and get less? Satisfaction guaranteed? No way. We really need competition to keep them honest in their claims or at least give us an option.
__label__1 I would like everyone to know that the way that Comcast has their channel lineup is to fool you as to what you really get on your TV. The channels like HBO and Starz are showed that they are part of the lineup, but hold on. Now there is a mark like this "^" by the HBO HD and Starz HD. So even if you pay for HD and it shows that HBO and Starz are part of the lineup, you still have to pay separate for them. My recommendation is for people to drop Comcast, which is the only cable provider in my area. If you want cable, you pay a new price for something every year. Or they give you something free then in a year or so, send you a hidden message in the bill that says, "Oh by the way, the free stuff... you now have to pay for" or you don't get the channels anymore from then on out. They give you channels you have no need for, then charge you more money. The answer to this problem is to drop Comcast as I did and get Dish or DirecTV. Get more things for less money. Comcast stinks!
__label__1 Roku informed me I did not have internet access. I called Comcast. At every step I was required to provide my phone, address, and last 4 of my social. This was magnified as my call was repeatedly "dropped" and I had to start over with reps who were patronizing and difficult to understand at times. They passed me from person to person until I finally insisted they send someone to solve the problem, thereby avoiding being passed on interminably thru the system without solving the problem.
__label__1 We have had Comcast for 20 years or so. The last 5 years have been ridiculous. Our costs have become outrageous. We now pay 158 dollars a month for cable and internet service.The problem is that unlike other utilities, there is no other service in our community. Comcast owns the cable coming into our city unlike the telecommunications industry where you can get numerous providers.My brother-in-law is a broker for the natural gas industry. He can send his gas down anyone's pipe. Xcel energy and our other utilities need approval from the state for rates, service, etc. Every time they provide new services available, they seem to make everything cost an additional fee. You may recall the ad about the new digital service provided by the networks. Comcast said that if you were a customer, you did not need the free one provided by the government. One year later, you now have to rent their boxes in order to continue service to all your TVs. If they would have run an ad saying by the way, next year we will be billing you an additional two dollars per TV, we may have gotten our free digital converter. They continually come up with another way to get a few more dollars out of you. Perhaps someone can explain to me how the MagicJack is twenty dollars a year but when you add phone in a "bundle", it's 30 dollars a month with an additional fee of 7 dollars a month to rent your new cable modem because your original modem does not have the Jack. Perhaps after twenty years of cable and five years of one and fifty dollars a month, I have already paid for the cable and my modem.
__label__1 My girlfriend and I switched from an old Comcast box to the new X1 DVR box. It's been one problem after another. I watch NHL playoffs, so the first thing I tried to do was search for games and record them. I used the search function and found that Xfinity had the NHL playoffs listed as a "TV series" and had grouped every playoff game into "episodes". But not every playoff game showed up under the list of "episodes". So if I wanted to record some games, I had to flip through the guide hour by hour, channel by channel, day by day. When trying to record from the listing on the guide, I was only allowed to extend the recording (I always extend recordings of games in case of overtime) by 5 minutes. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. It's a fact that 90% of the use of extending recording is for sports in case of overtime. Approximately 0% of the entire earth's population wants to extend their sports game by 5 minutes. Next, I tried to record game 7 of the NY Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins. It appears as "Stanley Cup Playoffs" scheduled to air 4-6:30pm. After attempting to record the game, THE TITLE CHANGES to "NHL Live" and THE TIME SLOT CHANGES from 4-4:30pm! (And there is no NHL Live show scheduled in the guide). I extend the recording by 1 1/2 hrs and then the title CHANGES BACK to "Stanley Cup Playoffs", but the TIME SLOT stays the SAME!! So now, with 1 1/2 hrs extended time... The recording is now set for 4pm-6pm! Since the game is 3 hrs long, I missed the last hour of the game. THIS IS DIRECTLY DUE TO THE X1 XFINITY DVR SYSTEM.NOW.... I try to record Game 6 Chicago vs Minnesota listed for 6-8:30pm via the guide (this "episode" was not listed under "Stanley Cup Playoffs"). I hit record, try to add 1 1/2 hrs to the end of the game (this is the most you can add to the end of an "episode" ONLY IF YOU RECORD USING THE SEARCH FUNCTION), but the TITLE CHANGES to "Shark Tank" and DOES NOT add 1 1/2 hrs to the end of the game (end of recording remains 8:30pm). Once it hits 8:30pm, the recording stops. So I MANUALLY hit the record button in order to record the remainder of the game. The DVR DOES NOT let me record. I hit the button numerous times with no results. I tried going through the "INFO" screen to record and it finally DOES record, but by this time the GAME is on, but the guide says some other show is on and won't let me extend the recording.First, I called the standard customer service number and explained the problems I'd been having. The first guy I reached was VERY quiet and didn't say much of anything. A couple times I thought I lost connection. My hunch was that he was new. It's important to note that during this call, I was watching my favorite team play an NHL playoff game. It's also important to note that at this point, I had ALREADY missed SEVERAL games and ends of games due to Xfinity's poor DVR performance. So after another stretch of dead silence, all of a sudden my TV screen goes black in the middle of the game! I asked him if that was him doing something to the DVR and he said yes. That he had sent a "signal" to the box without saying a word to me about what he was going to do... Without asking if this was a good time... Without saying hardly anything at all! I just hung up the phone. Strange thing happened after that "signal" was sent... The screensaver now pops up randomly while watching live TV, while watching playbacks of recordings, while watching On Demand movies. So the "customer service" rep interrupted my hockey game to add another problem to my DVR box!I decided to call a second time to explain the problems I've been having with the X1 system, including explaining what had happened the last time I called. THIS representative proceeded to tell me how to turn the screensaver function off. As if that was the solution to THEIR problem. It was at this point that I realized that I was getting absolutely NOWHERE with calling "customer service". I decided to take more active measures in my quest for customer satisfaction. So I started sending e-mails. First to NBCSN to explain that hockey games are 3 hours long. You would think that since they're a sports network that they WOULD KNOW HOW LONG NHL HOCKEY GAMES LAST. NOT 2 1/2 hours. Not 2 hours. 3 hours!!Second, I began writing emails to Comcast (Xfinity...whatever it's called) to explain that the way the X1 DVR box performs seems thrown together and untested. The IDEA behind the format is a good one, but there are WAY too many "bugs" in this system to have released this garbage to the public. I sent an e-mail to Tom **. The reply I got was from someone named "Risa" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I replied with my account number so that they could more fully research my issues.The second email I got was from someone named "Lovasie" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I got a 3rd email from someone named "LaQuinta" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I got a 4th email from someone named "Betsy" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. Just when I was about to lose my mind... I get a phone call from Stephen ** who arranged to have a tech come out to my house to assess the functionality of my X1 DVR box. He said someone would be out to see me on 6/11/14 in the "early afternoon".No one called. No one showed up. I hate Comcast. I despise Xfinity. The only thing worse than their cable is their customer service. I think I may just stop paying my bill and use the X1 box for target practice.
__label__0 My issue was originally diagnosed on August 27th as a weak signal in the underground cable line coming into my house. The technician ordered a new line to be installed on Sept 2nd. It is now Sept 23rd, and the line has still not been installed. For the past month, I have made over 10 calls to Comcast, and have been promised that the crew will be at my house to install the line "the next day". I have intermittent TV and internet connections that go in and out randomly, and I am at my wit's end. None of the customer service reps or supervisors I have spoken to have been helpful at all.
__label__0 I've been with Comcast for over 1500 days, and the day they migrated to SmartZone my 2000 emails were deleted. As an email service SmartZone is a joke. If somebody emails you with images attached and you try to send a reply, it is impossible to un-attach the images from the original email on your reply. Its time to take them to court, and to switch over to Verizon. After paying $50 per month for over four years the emails I've gathered have all been lost. These included gallery communications which I cannot refer to, and dealings with clients whom I have freelanced for. I cannot begin to calculate the negative consequences this will have on my career.
__label__1 I have been experience service outages in my area. The worse thing about the situation is that when you call they tell you everything is working and that the problem is with the connections in your home. After several calls they finally admit that there was an outage. This company's DNA consist mainly of lying to their customer.
__label__1 I called to express my surprise and displeasure with receiving 23 declines for Comcast service ON THE SAME DAY. Apparently their internal systems do not capture this data AND it is my issue of THEY flood me with fraudulent requests. When I asked to speak to a supervisor? I was refused. SO GLAD I cancelled them 2 years ago!!!
__label__1 I specifically asked the internet sales representative if the charges for service were a flat rate which would not increase drastically like most contract deals, and was assured it would stay the same... Four months later it has increased 40%... I consider the sales tactics of Comcast to be deceptive at best and outright fraud at worst. I am sure they spend more on advertising than customer service and don't give a rat's ** about their customers... SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND GET A DIFFERENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 This company is a joke! I LOVE cable tv and there are no other companies in the area that offer cable tv. Against my better judgement I signed up for comcast. I knew they were a horrible company to work with but I just really wanted cable. Previously my parents had problems with Comcast and when a technician came out to fix the problem he also stole sunglasses and money.I started having problems with my internet about 4 weeks ago. I hesitated to call for help because I knew it was going to be painful....and boy was I right. I was put on hold for 20 minutes, when tech support couldn't help fix my problem (by restarting my router) they transferred me to another dept, another 20 min on hold. When I explained AGAIN my problem to the new department they tried to transfer me back to tech support. WOW! I made an appointment for a tech to come visit me- had to take a vacation day from work because it was a 4 hour window. Technician did not show up, and did not call. Again, I didn't realize a company could stay in business working like this...but I guess when there is no competition they can do what they want.I called again a week later and set up another appointment- again a no call no show. I called yesterday to cancel my service and was transferred to a total of 4 departments with a hold time of more than 30 minutes each time. When I explained I also needed a credit to my account because my internet was not working I was told I needed to call back to speak to the billing department (another 30min hold wait), and shockingly the billing department's systems were down. I still am trying to call and get credit to my account for 4 weeks without internet- each time I get another excuse on why they can't credit my account.Bottom line- I don't have cable anymore which sucks, but I also don't have to deal with Comcast so I think I win. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!! Hopefully ATT will provide service in my area soon.
__label__1 I am not a Comcast customer but I feel very bad for those who are nor would I EVER consider services with them. I ordered a copy of my credit report November of last year to find that someone had set up an account and services in my name with Comcast in Knoxville, Tennessee. I am a resident of California and have lived here my whole life. Never in my life have I ever been to Tennessee so how the account was set up is beside me but regardless I know these things happen so I made sure to follow all directions they gave me to take care of this matter. I filed a police report, waited for it to arrive in the mail, filled out a fraud packet sent to me by Comcast and submitted via fax and email. I called the next day to verify that it was received as well that the services at the address were disconnected. Comcast verified they would pull the account from collections as it is not a valid debt as well as disconnect services so that the account does not affect my credit in the future. I felt a little skeptical and the following week called Comcast to verify once again that the account set up in my name was closed. The person on the other end told me it was still open as well as that I am past due and need to make a payment immediately to avoid disconnection of services. Well... you can probably guess how upset I was now having to repeat the story and ask to have the account closed immediately once again. I eventually was transferred to a supervisor who stated they have no notes or documentation of the incident and offered to help if I could resend the fraud packet and copy of police report AGAIN and follow up in 24 hours. Well, what other choice did I have? We went back and forth on this for about a month because they kept saying they would close the account then I would call a couple days later to find out that it was still open. Finally after about 32 days, things were resolved and I verified that the account was closed, or so I thought until I ordered my credit report again this year to find that an account in Knoxville Tennessee (same address) has been sent again to collections. Again I am taking care of this mess and have been for the past 8 days. I've been transferred more times than I can keep track of and hung up on 3 times. And am now on the phone with them and have been on hold for the past 1hr and 3 min. I have been extremely cooperative with this company through this whole process as my credit is something that I really care about and take care of but I really wish there was another way. I am speaking with my lawyer to see what I can have done as this company continuously keeps allowing these people to open an account in my name knowing that it is fraud. At this point I feel helpless and am extremely crushed that I am having to deal with this problem year after year.
__label__0 It looks like Comcast has decided to use the switch to digital to its advantage. This wasn't evident to me at first but on October 26, 2010, I discovered that my current level of service was no longer being offered. I had to either accept fewer channels or increase my bill by $40 per month and gain quite a few channels. Our household has had limited basic cable for 15 years. The price has increased from around $12 per month to $19.95 in that time period. We even moved once with no noticeable change to our plan. Now Comcast is telling me that I'm getting channels I shouldn't, and that I must accept fewer channels for the same amount or pay $60 per month (but they do have a 6-month special). This is because with the switch to digital, the limited basic package was reduced and for the last year or so I've been getting channels I shouldn't.From what I can gather, Comcast does not want limited basic cable customers. This reduction in service is an attempt to purge this level of service. I've been told that you can't call up and receive limited basic cable - only those who've had it are allowed to keep it. Once you're out you can't get it any more. It seems convenient for Comcast to blame this on the switch to digital.By the way, I'm not even sure Comcast has their story straight. The first rep I talked with said I could go pick up the technology I need from a Customer Service center (no mention of fees or charges). The second one I spoke with said that I must choose a $60 plan if I wanted more than channels 2-28 with my cable. 
__label__1 I was behind on my monthly payments and called in to go over my bill. I spoke with a nice car from the Philippines who told me Comcast had been overcharging me by $45 to $47 each month since March. She put thru a credit which she said would be between $250 and $300 that would appear by Friday. She also made an appointment for a tech to come look at my Internet whose performance had been terrible for months. She said she'd note the account to show the credit will be applied to my back payment so. That my service would not be turned off. I came home the following night to find my service disconnected - I called d's to see what happened & was told they had no record of a request for a credit on my account & they would not turn my service back on unless I paid my bill first. I late ranked them on a subsequent call to review the 1st call I made & reap for themselves what I was promised - the rep said she'd ask a manager to do this but when the tech came out no credit was on my account & no manager had contacted me saying they had listened to my 1st call. The tech said he couldn't do any work unless I paid my bill first. By this time I was so disgusted with having to deal with this thieving lying company that I told the tech to take everything Comcast out of my house. They have lost a customer that had been with them for over 20 years. This company no longer deserves my business.
__label__1 Being a customer with Comcast for many years and believing in the fact that they work with their customers is totally deceiving!!! They pretend they are helping you and put you on a contract without actually saying that you are in! I must say that I in believing that they are working with me got put into a contract so you can get out. I spoke to a customer service person and when I asked to speak to talk to her supervisor she came back on the line and told me before I speak to her supervisor that I had to talk to her again.
__label__1 From day 1 they installed, it has never work RIGHT. I have call your damn customers service and no one seems to know what the hell is wrong .... mMy calls get put on hold for hours and then dropped - no call back. Now I got bill for service that I never enjoy. 1 thing for sure is cable works just fine but Internet HELL NOOOOOO.  I want this crap out of here but now they want me to pay bill first...how nice.
__label__1 By far the worst internet service you can get. I was suppose to get the top speed and only certain times of day which is only like an hour will you get those top speeds. Additionally the service constantly has outages usually when you need the internet the most. THE WORST COMPANY ever who does nothing to make it right with customers. Now they are talking about and implementing in certain states Data Caps. So ridiculous, of course a terrible company like GE owns this terrible company. There are so many other alternative options for internet. Avoid signing up with Xfinity at all costs! You have been warned! They don't even deserve One Star!
__label__5 My problem with Comcast is every month, my bill is due on the 25th of the month. My cycle ends on the 5th of every month. There is a grace period of 7 days. Before my cycle ends, they generate a new bill before the grace period even ends. So when they sent me a new bill, they still carry the 2 months bill even though they are already paid. Not only are they are doing that, I am being charged a late fee of 9.95, so now I am paying 195.00 a month. I am told that they would drop the late fee but the next month, it's back again. And yet, they say they charge ahead of time.
__label__0 I would like this email to serve as a complaint against the rudest customer service agent I have ever spoken to in my entire life, who just stated to me after days worth of problems with my service that without reading any of the notes in my account regarding the problems and why my services were transferred, restored, canceled, etc., that she was canceling my tech appointment. She said that the previous agent made an "error in reconnecting your service" that the previous agent worked in a different department, and implied that they didn't know what they were doing and that a manager would have to call me back on my cell phone because she was canceling my home phone as we spoke. That was 10 minutes ago and I have still not heard from a Comcast manager. It's a disgrace, Shawn was the customer service (not) agent!
__label__1 I wouldn't even call this a review, more of an injustice. The scam these guys pull is unacceptable. Hidden increased charges, piss poor speeds, poor customer service. You're rated the worst company in America for a reason.
__label__0 COMCAST has the worst Customer Service of any company I know. You go on their web site an can only find how to buy stuff, not information about their services, their programming, or even a contact to complain to... I have tried to find out what Basketball games would be televised in my area and can't find anyone who knows. I did find one customer service rep who talked to everyone she knew within COMCAST and could not find an answery so she called ESPN. Horay!!! but they didn't know what COMCAST would televise in my are only that they were broadcasting it. When you can get someone to come out to fix a problem they quote we will be there sometime between 8AM & 5PM, so you take the day off an they don't arrive until 6PM to tell you they can't fix it but you will be on the Top of their list the next day????? Why not today????
__label__1 I have had cable, DISH, and U-verse, etc. in the past. All are eh... but you know what? Comcast takes the cake. I have never been driven to take time out of my day just to gripe online for all to see. But consumers, stay away! So my first terrible experience with Comcast is that they took 5 phones and 2 months to come out and bury the lines they had to lay in my front yard to get the cable needed into my house. Finally got someone when my special needs neighbor tripped and fell!Now 3 months into my contract, I have had my internet, phone, and TV go out for HOURS at a time. I would spend 3 hours on with a tech when it will come back up after the technician resets the router manually for the 3rd or 4th time. I have had it, I work from home occasionally and this is a huge inconvenience! The hardware is faulty, I understand that sometimes you get a lemon... but 3 months! 3 months! I have had it. Worst company ever. Crappy equipment and terrible customer service, and worse is the technicians they hire! Not a clue! Comcast should send a technician out here to switch out this equipment before I set a bonfire to it.
__label__1 Comcast suddenly, and without prior notice, added 8% to my bill. My services had not changed. I asked about why my bill had increased - they told me they now were charging for sending me a bill. Paper bills now cost $5 to send. I had never been told there would be a charge for paper billing and had not accepted the higher charge. They surely are charging thousands of other customers, many of whom will not notice or question the charge. This is not the first time Comcast has added charges without justification or notification.
__label__1 I called Comcast to set up a post dated payment with my mom's bank card. Well she went out of town before I could deposit the money into her account so I couldn't get in touch with her to get her account number so I can deposit the money in her account. So as soon as I got paid that Friday I paid the bill come to find out they still took the payment from her account and I understand that a postdated payment can't be changed once made, but that's two payments for the same amount to the same bill. And now they say I can't get a refund because of the policy. I ask to speak to the manager. They told me a manager would be calling me in 72 hours. It's been 5 days now still no call. Comcast sucks!
__label__0    I moved in August 2009 and transferred my Comcast service to my new address. I pay my bill in full and on time. I kept getting bills for my old address and when I contacted a CSR over Comcast's chat service, I was told that that account was closed and that I would not see any more bills. Well, today I got another one, for two months' worth of payments. I called at 8:45 AM. I spoke with a CSR who told me that the account had been sent to collections and she transferred me there. When I spoke with the collections agent she told me that there was still a modem at my old address which was why I was being charged. I explained that I didn't live there anymore. She told me that I would have to prove that I had returned the modem by bringing a receipt into a Comcast store. Well -- I don't have the receipt. She said that I would have to prove it. I said: "are you telling me that for the rest of my life, I will be charged for service, because I can't find the receipt?" She said, AGAIN: you have to prove that you returned it. I asked to speak to someone else and she told me no one was available and that I would have to leave my phone number with her. Again, I asked her if I would continue being charged until the day I died for this service. She said yes, you will be charged $45. I asked "per month, or a one-time charge?" And she said "a one-time charge." Why didn't she say that in the first place? Answer? I didn't ask.So one final time, I asked why I was being charged for service that had been transferred, and she sent me back to customer service. Well--this CSR looked into it, and found out that Comcast had forgotten to turn off my service at my old residence. So, it was their fault all along! She said that they would be crediting me the money and closing the account. I will believe it when I see it. And she did not once apologize or take responsibility on Comcast's behalf for this error. And I am still mad about that collections representative.When I spoke with the collections agent she told me that there was still a modem at my old address which was why I was being charged.

__label__1 In December of 2011, I made the decision to move up to broadband from dial up. The Comcast install rep installed things and once up, he commented on how slow my computer was, suggesting that I disable certain functions on my computer to improve speed. I did not do this, as I didn't have enough knowledge of what each function did to mess around with that.After using the new service for a bit, I went to Comcast's website and noticed they had a download available, which said "optimize your computer for Comcast" or something to that effect. I'm very cautious about downloading anything, so I called Comcast twice to verify that the site was indeed theirs and asked if it was safe to download. Both reps said yes, with the second one verifying the web address I provided was Comcast's.Later that night, I was no longer able to connect to the internet. I noticed certain programs were missing. Slowly, everything on my computer was wiped out. Fortunately, I had backed up my files, but now my computer is useless. I tried reinstalling after a long search to find the product key, but none of the drivers work, except for the CD. Modems aren't recognized. All the programs I had are gone. As stated, I was very cautious about downloading things. I had only had my computer crash once before and that was when I first got it and started using the internet. The first day I got broadband from Comcast, I got a virus from the download on their site and my computer crashed.I called Comcast and requested to speak to a local supervisor. I spoke with Patti and she herself stated that it was definitely the link on their site that caused my computer to crash. She said she was going to look into some things. I called her again and she said it was being processed as a damage claim and that I should call her back by about mid January 2012 if I didn't hear from her. I didn't hear from her and called her back, only to get her voice mail. I called a few more times, getting her voice mail every time, and let her know I would be suing the company if I didn't receive compensation for my computer. I have not been able to pursue this due to lack of enough money to file a case in civil court.Up until today, March 23rd, my mother had not received her monthly bills. We assumed this was how Comcast was reimbursing me for my computer. We found out differently. There came a bill in the amount of $400. My mother called the regular Comcast line and explained the situation. She asked if they could allow her to pay the bill in increments until she could get caught up. They refused and said if she didn't pay they were going to cancel service. Someone from Comcast kept calling about the bill. I called and told the rep I spoke to, not to call anymore or we would sue for harassment, explaining that this was already discussed with another rep. She continued to argue with me, even when I told her about the do not call law.I called Patti, the supervisor I had spoken with, and told her again that I would take Comcast to court for the damage to my computer and told her (again, via voice mail) about the situation with the billing issues. I explained that my mother had been a customer for 30 years and how despicable it was, that both she and I had to deal with this. I'm not holding my breath waiting for her to call, much less resolve this. I have these conversations recorded and explained to Patti when I spoke with her in December, that I was recording any conversations I had with the company. 
__label__1 I had an erroneous charge on my bill for a Pay Per View that I did not order. It was on the date I had the television service installed. I was told someone ordered a Pay Per View fight that cost $80. I explained to customer service that we had just moved in on that date and that during the time frame in question we were busy moving and that no one ordered it. I was told the first time that someone watched it for 44 minutes, and then the second customer service rep said someone in my household watched it for 56 minutes. I again reiterated that I did not order it and asked that the erroneous charge be removed from my bill, but they refused. In addition, when the service was set up the tech turned on all the T.V.'s, left them on and did not explain how to use the remotes. He could have charged it for all I know.
__label__0 I should have sensed trouble in the fact that the installing technician was in such a hurry to get the job done that he could hardly give me the time to explain what he had done. Since that day, I have had trouble with my internet. Access has been barred to many sites and a Comcast message comes up "Oops! Activation incomplete."I have called three times. Nothing compared to some of your contributors and the last call to a "supervisor" (I wonder) I was assured that the problem would be fixed within 48 hours at the most and probably less. Well, no surprise, four days later nothing has been "fixed." My frustration is only beginning, I guess, but one does wonder about the financial impact on the company to have to keep coming back for "fixes" instead of getting the job done right to begin with. I would think it would be more cost efficient to do quality work in the first place, even if it cost a bit more to hire better qualified technicians than to string the work out over several weeks, months, years? I'm sure the costs incurred is being passed on to the customer(s) so maybe they do it on purpose. Is this fraudulent?
__label__0 For the past five years I have signed up for the basic cable services and was able to view a lot more limited channels . As of 3/10/09 they have cut down the channels to 2-13 without any notice or notification. I have called and they told me that my area was audited and the mistake was corrected. In order to view those channels I will need to get a digital device which is $55 plus, I will need to upgrade my services to receive those basic channels which is around $50 a month. They must really be hurting for businnes. If I would have known this I would of ordered a converter box to receive the basic channels for free. I am outraged of how they treat there customers. 
__label__1 I set up an appointment and it was inconvenient to make sure I was home. After 30 mins past the window I phoned and spoke to a foreign agent who assured me I would get a call back within 30 mins. An hour later after being given a ticket number no one has bothered to call me. My internet service is so terrible and slow and nonexistent.
__label__1 My husband had Comcast for years. Sadly, he passed away this year and I had the difficult task of dealing with these people. I went to talk to someone at Comcast to (1) change the service over to my name and (2) get a more affordable package. After paying $600.00 between May 2nd and June 16th, I was told that my current bill was $178.00 because of past due charges, late fees etc. The monthly bill was approximately $155.00 so naturally, I was very upset.I called several times to complain that each time I paid this bill, I paid what was due. Needless to say, I got no one who was willing to satisfy a dissatisfied customer. To add insult to injury, a female customer service agent placed me on hold never returned and when I got home, my two main boxes had been mysteriously disconnected. A former technician with Comcast assured me that someone in the center had to disconnect my two main boxes because the other televisions in the house were working just fine.
__label__1 I have talked to a customer service representative about my service twice and both times they just argue with me. I have been charged for Starz, which I did not even order, from the time my service was started in August and the representative did not offer a credit for it. I have had a small adapter box that I need to send back because it hasn't worked since our service started and when I talked to a representative about it, she offered for a technician to come back out for a fee. That's faulty equipment that my son has not been able to use at all. Comcast isn't concerned about customer satisfaction at all. If there wasn't a monopoly on internet service in this area I would switch to U-verse.
__label__1 I moved house last February 15, 2012. Prior to the move, I called to terminate my cable/Phone/Internet with Comcast. I was advised to return the following items: 2 receivers and the modem. My husband paid all the unpaid bills so that we can transfer the service to the other home. I then went to Comcast Gude Drive office to return all the equipment they asked, 2 receivers and 1 modem box, and in fact, I also returned 2 remote controls. I made sure to go and return these items myself to make sure that they were really returned. After one month, I get a bill from Comcast for $299.95. I called to question this bill, but no one seemed to know which department can help me. I was passed around into different departments, and the last person I spoke with, hanged up on me when I said I could barely hear her because her voice seemed so far away. So today, 3/19/2012, I drove to Comcast again, lined up like the rests of the people and waited patiently for my turn. The gentleman who helped ( thank god he was very nice), told me the items were not returned so he gave me a breakdown of the bill ($164.00 for the receivers, $80.00, and $55.65 for an additional charge for keeping the service on the other house).My husband said the bill from the other house was already fully paid and he has a receipt for it. He said he can take out the $164.00 charges for receivers that were not returned, but not the $80.00 for the modem. I told him my story, but he said he cannot do anything about it. He needs the receipt to show I returned them. But won't their system show the transaction? He said there was an activity, but he won't tell me exactly what they were. Why would he give me a credit for the receivers and not the modem if his computer says I did not return anything? Why would the system show that I was there that day if I did not return anything? I wouldn't simply waste my time lining up, waiting for a period of time, if I did not have a purpose! Because I did return all 3 items and now they're telling me and charging me for the items that were not returned, it's all a lie!This is all unfair! I think it is money making gimmick! How in the world did this happen, when I, personally brought those items and saw the man logged it in his computer, said everything is done and gave me the receipt. I can't find my receipt at this point, I am not sure if I kept it or maybe misplaced it during the move. But in all honesty, they have the items and I am being charged for it! I feel cheated and treated unfairly! I do not owe Comcast anything, please somebody help me! I told the Comcast representative that it is not a million dollars to pay, but the principle of it all, that I went and returned the items and now I am being told I did not! How can they employ people like these to handle these transactions and leave their costumers in so much grief!
__label__0 I have emailed the CEO at Comcast to dispute a negative report that has just popped up on my credit report because Comcast is stating that I owed them cable services from March - April of this year (2008). I told them repeatedly that I was not even living in Florida during that time and I already had a COMCAST account in Boston to show that I was not there. It seems that when they went to the house to disconnect cable at my request in 2007, somebody told them to not disconnect, then they signed for me, kept cable paid until 2008, and then let it go into default. I had no idea this was happening and my credit should not take the hit for this. They will not remove it, they blame me for it, and are asking for payment. This is wrong. I now have a recent negative report on all three credit bureaus. I just got a job working with NASA, that negative report could prove to be very costly. I stated my case, but they are just telling me that it sounds more like a domestic dispute since a realtive must have just continued the cable (but I asked them to disconnect it in my name). They did not, and since I moved i had no idea that this account went into collections.
__label__1 Last week, I had a very low cable in my backyard. I had to call SIX times to get that resolved (and only have filing a report with the FCC). Tonight, and other days this week, I am unable to get the ONLY TWO CHANNELS I watch. I find that VERY strange. Why do all other channels work, except the two that I watch at night. When I asked for a supervisor, I was put on hold for 5 minutes, only to be told that he would be with me in another few minutes. At that point, I hung up. The service I am getting from this company is deplorable. Yet I am expected to pay my bill on time!
__label__0 Comcast cable would not fix my cable, out of service for a long time. Supervisors need to do a good job. Misael supervisor is not solving my problem. I have no cable for over a week and none available to come out.
__label__1 I have had Comcast for over a year. My On Demand goes out constantly. After having the techs out 3 times, it was decided that my wiring in the wall is bad. I live in an apartment complex and they don't wish to replace the wiring. Comcast solution, you pay for it. In the meantime, I pay $121 a month for basic service and internet, top dollar. They told me they would credit some of my payment back; however, because the problem is not resolved (I won't pay for new wiring), they refuse to credit anything. They had already promised me they would credit the account previous to the tech coming out. So I am stuck with On Demand that works 40 percent of the time and I am charged top dollar.
__label__1 Increasingly poor service over the last 5 years. Not one person ever honors what they promise. Bill changes every month, no explanation. Most times one can only talk with someone in Asia. Finally, had enough and switched to Direct. Still waiting 3 weeks later for shipping label to return equipment, despite talking with 2 people and sending 3 emails. Each time one deals with Comcast, a very complex phone tree navigation is required, never an option to hit zero and talk with a human. Seems the systems are fragmented and what one CSR can see another cannot. Each call with them costs me at least 30 minutes of my life I won't get back. If there were another internet provider in my area, I would cancel all Comcast service and never do business with them again.
__label__1 I was promised $17.95 upgrade with a $7.00 dollar discount for six months. The first 3 months I was on the phone every month to get the discount that I was promised. Now month 4 comes up and no discount again. I spent 5 days (an hour here and there) to try and get someone to discuss my bill and lo and behold they have no record of a $7.00 dollar discount at any time. Not even the past 3 months that I received the $7.00 discount!
__label__0 Over the course of the last 2 years, I have had Comcast technicians out to my house no less than 13 times for interrupted TV service, slow internet and dropping internet. I have called no less than 20 times to complain. I have paid $150 a month for this TV and internet service that is sub-par. I have the slow internet connections documented from Speedtest.net to validate my issues.$150 a month for this service. I see where Comcast has settled a class action suit which got each consumer $16. You have to be kidding me. I subscribe to a service which cost me $150 a month and get $16 back in a class action suit! This is a joke. I want a year of what I paid back for services not received as promised at least $1500.00
__label__1 Our cable and Internet line was cut yesterday (Thursday) and when I called to tell them that exact thing they told they have to troubleshoot it from their office; okay fine but when you couldn't get it fixed you think that they would believe me then? Nope! They told me the next available tech would be out on Monday and I told them fine but if you get any cancellations we would like to be put in that slot. I get a call today (Friday) from a guy whom I can't understand tell me that our service should be fixed now and I said "oh you guys had someone replace the line?" He said, "No we repaired it from our end." Again don't believe me when I said that our line was cut! I told him Internet is still out and so I turned on all tv's and they are all out...still (big surprise there) and I told him so. He said, "Okay I see you have a appointment on Monday. The technician will be out and he will fix it..." Okaaayyy seriously what was the point of that phone call when I told them the issue. Our neighbors line was cut. He has AT&T and they were out within an hour to repair his line!!! What the heck Comcast! Not very happy at all with them right now! I wish we would of never signed the two year agreement that way we could switch right now! Your customer service really stinks.
__label__0 We signed up for Comcast high speed internet. The tech that hooked the internet up at our house told us for signing up we would get ten free song downloads. When I tried to get information on where to get the downloads Comcast transferred the phone from one department to another and  another and another and back to where I started. Rachael (sales rep for Comcast) denying there is no such thing. Rachael  said sign up for a program called Rhapsody but at my cost and I could get all the songs I wanted. She said the tech was misinformed. I asked to talk to her supervisor and she refused saying they would call me back. She transferred me to another department and they gave me an address to send a letter if I didn't like it. After a number of requests to talk with someone higher up the chain of command and being refused, Rachael claimed they were not responsible for what the tech told us and laughed. I hung up. They lied to me. The tech, who represents Comcast, told me I would get ten free song downloads for signing up with Comcast but now that we have paid for the service and signed up everyone passed the buck and no one will take responsibility for what the tech told me. They don't have a complaint department, I checked, I asked and they don't care.Ten song downloads that were supposed to be free.
__label__0 My phone is not working, and I checked everything: the cords are all plugged in and the light is on.
__label__1 I had an appointment with Comcast in Saturday for installation service. Waited from 3 to 7, called 5 times, was told the tech was on the way and still don't have service. Once again, service and have an appointment for tonight from 5 to 7. Called 3 times. Finally by 7:30, I call again. I'm told that it was closed. Then nobody can tell me why the ticket was closed, then I'm put on hold to wait for the supervisor because I requested one. After waiting for him for 35 minutes, he gets on the line. I say, "Hey you know, why did I have to wait for you so long." "It is my name is Byron, and I will customer service." And no apology for the time, with no apology for a bit, but I'm wasted. I'm waiting for an appointment. Just total disregard for anybody's time or just any kind of customer service. They are horrible.
__label__1 For the past year I have had ongoing issues with Comcast the X1 Service. There's been over 28 visits to my home with the Field Service Department and their Line Department. It keeps going back and forth to both Departments. They have replaced everything in my home and also all the lines outside of my home. As of today 1/3/2016 the issues are still happening. Comcast Corporate office is telling me that there is nothing else that Comcast can do to correct my service. Several Techs from Comcast told me that they have been having major issues with the X1 service and that I should cancel that service and keep what I had over a year ago. Comcast said they care about their customers. Well that's a crock of bull. I just want my cable to work for 1 day without having any issues with their service that they CANNOT RESOLVE OR CORRECT. And if you don't pay your bill on time they will turn your cable off without any regrets.
__label__1 Comcast is blocking NBA games airing on TBS and ESPN via Sling TV that are also aired on Comcast Sports Network. This is illegal.
__label__1 After numerous trips to local Comcast in Culpeper VA, I finally submit a FCC Complaint about losing at least 3" from screen on TV in house. Comcast sent tech w/ supervisor. OUTCOME? IF I PAY MORE FOR MY CABLE. THEY CAN FIX PROBLEM. FCC refiled.
__label__1 I have been trying to talk with someone at Comcast for a week. Today I was hung up on 4 times after having being on hold for 15, 18, 16, 25 each time the phone would just hang up. There is no good time to call. Comcast should be ashamed of themselves for such horrible customer service and outsourcing jobs.
__label__1 First, a door to door representative from their company told me he could get me a lower rate without a contract, last summer. The next time I viewed my bill it was more expensive than my current plan and I was now locked into a two year contract. I was never able to get the low rate I had back. Then, they just upped my bill without notice by over $60 and are saying my promotion ended. I'm not sure how that is possible because the door to door guy was at my house less than a year ago and my costs went up then. I would not even rate them 1 star.
__label__5 My family has been trying for numerous days to get problems with our service addressed. A technician came to our home 3 days ago and spent several hours repairing and replacing old, damaged connections, etc. We even agreed to a $50 charge for him to go into the house and crawlspace to find possible problems. After he completed the repairs, both inside and out, he had a good signal and all was fine. Later that evening, however, the problems started again. We have made numerous calls back to Comcast. After listening to recording after recording, we finally reached a rep who asked the same questions over and over that we have answered again and again. They reset the signal time after time but the problems still exists. The reps are with an outsourcing company in another country and communication is an issue. The last call that I made I asked twice to be transferred to a complaint department or supervisor; however, she would not transfer me.
__label__5 It all started when we moved. A rep told us we would need to exchange our boxes for different ones in order for the cable to work right. My son drove down to the center to exchange the boxes and he was told we didn't have to. Oh, we did an install ourselves, and done it many a time before, so we found out one line didn't work, so here came the cable guy. Our fault; 'you don't pay' and vise versa. Well their fault, we didn't receive a bill for April, so I called the automated bill pay and fell out of my chair, $456.00! We have the $89.00 package, $119.00 with tax! Called and red hot, I got a representative and immediately started to almost scream at this guy. He introduced himself and I could barely understand him. I'm man, I thought no use! He said I would be angry too, I asked his name again and it was Burney. I asked him, "Do you spell it with a 'ie' at the end or a 'ey'?" He said, "'Ey' why you ask? "That was the name of my dad who had passed away." Immediately we hit it off. Burney is a name not used much spelled that way. So I was charged for the cable guy, I was charged for the installation, I was charged for the equipment which I never received and misc items. This man pulled out all the stops.Got my bill down to $130.00 for April and got the May bill down to normal. Now this is the type of representative Comcast should model their people after. Come to find out he was from Spain, not overseas but right in sunny California! If you ever call Comcast again ask for Burney not Burnie, and Burney if you read this, David says hi!!!
__label__1 The volume getting louder, this happens all the time! Also too many commercials over the past few months. 14 minutes of commercials in a 30 minute show. I am paying for this service/cable TV, this is unacceptable! I can see this happening on the network TV. Not pay TV. Pay TV was not suppose to have and did not have commercials at the start. I understand everyone wants more money, but this is out of control. What can I/we do about the situation?
__label__0 Fraudulent-Over Billing Practice, Did Not honor installation Promotion thus sending me an inflated bill as a result- -- I cancel my service for there failure to honor there promotion and have been disputing the over charges with Comcast for over 3 months now and no resolution to date has come from my efforts unfortunately my dispute has fell on deaf earsI returned all equipment and Comcast is still sending bills for charges and services that have been canceled and still trying to collect payment for the equipment that I returned I also received on my bill a bogus $50.00 charge on a September billI also gave them a $50 deposit for the service and have not received any adjustments to my account to reflect same.
__label__1 Comcast/Xfinity is the worst company I have ever dealt with. We've had Xfinity the past five months and we've had nothing but problems. When I call them to have these problems fixed they act as if I am a hassle and a bother. Are you kidding me? I'm paying for nothing but garbage.
__label__1 Hope 1 Star means very poor service.I made a payment on 8/10/2011, which was applied to my closed residential account and not my current business account with Comcast. Since that time, my business services have been disconnected 4 times for non-payment.Each time I contacted Comcast I was told that the payment would be credited to my business account, but it has not. As of today, I was informed that their practice is to issue a check within six weeks. I was assured that someone from Comcast would contact me to inform of the status of account. However, these were false statements because my service being interrupted is the only indication that the issue has not been resolve. (On several occasions I have contacted Comcast to see if the issue is resolved. At the time I was told that it would be noted on my account).
__label__1 I signed up for one year new internet service deal with the Comcast/Xfinity for $39.99 last November so I got the paperless bill for next following two months for $39.99/month. However, Comcast sent me the bill through mail and charged me $44.99. My bill is supposed to be $39.99/month for one year which means until this year November. That's the deal what I saw online and that's the deal what the customer representative signed me up for. I was not sure why they increased the bill by five dollars so I called and talked to one of representative. However, this representative did not what the heck she was talking about and I don't think she even had a clue why the bill increased by five dollars. She kept saying $44.99 is still a promotion value for same internet speed over and over again. But $44.99 is NOT what I signed up for!! I told her to let me talk to supervisor but she told me supervisor was busy. Well, I'm a busy person, too. Does she think I like talking to her for more than an hour? I was supposed to get a call from supervisor within two hours but it has been more than a day, and I still haven't got a call yet. Xfinity internet speed is faster and better than other but they have the WORST customer service.
__label__1 Comcast is the worst internet provider I've ever encountered bar none! All day I have to work on my computer for my business and everyday it's the same **! Slow and freezing up! I have to shut down everything and reboot in order to get anything done! Not to mention that most of the time, I have to start over with what I was doing because it's lost! They should be banned from continuing any internet service until they do what it takes to make sure that customers get what they are paying for and they provide what they promise! I intend on doing all I can to see that everybody will be warned of their incompetent service starting by filing complaints with the BBB and the CPA asap! I would suggest anyone going through this to do the same! You deserve and can get them to refund your money back! Just research that! I had to stop 4 times due to freeze ups just to complete this complaint! I'm surprised I got through it this time! Good luck!
__label__1 I requested my service to be transfer from my old address to the new one. I thought everything was fine until I called to confirm three days before my moving and found out that they do not service my new address. A week later, I received a $816.41 bill for early termination fees. What??? Yes, they basically cancelled my service, did not let me know and charged me for it. I called the 1800 number on the bill but the number apparently is private, then I email them but no one answer and during that process, I received a letter from a collection agency. I called them and they said that I have to disputed directly with them. So since I was not able to reach a human soul, I tried chatting in the site.I was helped by Emmanuel, which stated that I was right, however he said that I needed to call another number because they are the ones that handled that. I called and a service rep told me that he needed to escalate the matter to the escalation team (???) which said that they were not able to remove the early termination fees because somewhere in the contract states that I was responsible even If they do not service an area. (Whattt). What is more interesting is that I have a friend that just went through the same thing but in her case they were able to remove the fees. So bottom line, it seems that Comcast is choosing and picking who they would like to help!!! Do that sounds discriminatory to anyone???
__label__0 They 'upgraded' the guide 7/11/11 and without notification or price change eliminated: timers; ability to save dvr shows onto vhs tape (a huge thing!); can't view 5 programs on guide, 1 line hidden by new ad space which keeps bleeping in and out; no more audio/video settings to customize view; have to change view settings to one-view to read all guide info. 
__label__0 At the end of September 2010, I relocated from Michigan to Florida, and gave Comcast advance notice. I wanted to be sure that I would have internet service up until the time I left, and that I did not need cable TV as I was very busy with clearing out the house and moving. I let Comcast know what date I expected to leave, and we agreed to continue the internet service for two days after my departure, to ensure that I would not be without.The Saturday before I left, I took the two converter boxes to Comcast's Lyndon St. office in Detroit and made sure that I got my receipt for them, because I had heard the horror stories of what happens if you don't. I was hoping to avoid that nightmare, but it made little difference. I just got a call this morning that they were going to hand me over to collections for the equipment that was not turned in. Luckily, I have my little pink receipt to prove that I turned them in.When I called last week to find out why I couldn't get into my email account, the customer service rep told me that he saw that I still had their equipment, and I told him that I had a receipt and would scan and forward a copy by email, if necessary. He suggested that I contact Comcast Customer Loyalty to find out about getting access to my email account.This past Saturday, 10/16/2010, my wife made the call to Comcast Customer Loyalty as we only have cell lines, and Saturdays do not count against our minutes. I still wanted to find out if I could either have access to my email account that they closed without informing me in advance, or if they could at least forward all of my email to another address. My wife wanted assurance that Comcast had noted that they did indeed have their equipment back.The first rep told her that since the account was already closed, there was nothing that could be done about accessing my email account or forwarding it to another email address. She was then transferred to Edna to find out about if the equipment issue was resolved. Edna told my wife that she saw in their system where I had turned the equipment in, and that she figured that the customer service rep that I had talked to the week before did not go deep enough into our account information to see that we had our own modem, and that was probably the outstanding equipment that he was referring to. She was very quick, though to see to it that Comcast got their money for the two days that my service was left open after my departure. She assured my wife that she would waive the fee for taking a check over the phone, as we could not pay it online because we no longer had an open account! And with the outstanding fees being taken care of, we would not have to be bothered by Comcast again. Oh, and we never got a bill at our new address either, so I am kind of wondering just how did they intend getting the rest of their money. I did make sure though, that they had my forwarding address. Comcast may have sent the final bill to my old address, and it has just not gotten to me yet.In conclusion, I am hoping that with my return phone call to Comcast regarding the collections issue, they will forward me something indicating that I am now free and clear of them forever. They did give me a case number for future reference, this time with a projected closed by date of November 4, 2010. I will never, ever be tempted to use Comcast in the future. It's like a bad marriage from which you can have the devil of a time getting out of.
__label__0  i called back and let my husband call and spoke to someone in english. they fixed the problem in 5 minutes and it wqs real simple. this is not the first time with them. they hire people that dont know what they are doing. after all of this they only gave me a 5.00 credit on my bill.
__label__1 I signed up 6 months ago for a TV-Internet bundle from Comcast for $80 a month for 2 years. When I first signed up, I asked the guy, "Now, this is going to stay $80 a month for 2 years, right? No going up on the price or any surprise fees being tacked on?" "Oh, no, it'll stay $80 a month for 2 years, no surprises," I was told. Skip forward 6 months, my bill goes to $105. I call Comcast, what the heck? "Well, your DVR fee was a special promotion that ended at 6 months, we're sorry no one told you that." Am seriously considering cutting the cord, just going to internet. DirecTV was more expensive, but in 7 years, never had a problem with customer service or deceitful practices from them. Comcast Sucks!!
__label__1 Comcast has less than satisfactory customer service. The contract package I had with Comcast expired and I selected a new one. When I received my bill, I was overcharged for the new plan. I contacted Comcast customer service regarding an overcharge on my bill. It was resolved over the phone. I was given a lower correct amount to pay. Next month, the credit for the overcharge was added to my bill stating I had not paid my full amount. I called customer service regarding the issue and all the representative could do was re-read my bill to me over and over again. The representative was NEVER able to explain the situation. I told the representative I can read myself, but thanks for your time. I later found that during the transaction of changing from one contract to another, Comcast made an unauthorized credit check on me. This is a HARD check and reflected negatively on my credit report. I had worked 5 years to clear up my credit report. In January all negative reports were dropping off my credit report. NOW, I have a new negative mark on my credit report that will remain for 2 years. Highly upset with the way I was treated during my experience with COMCAST'S CUSTOMER SERVICE.
__label__1 In a three week time frame unsuccessfully dealing with Comcast for my house (A) & (ironically) my boss's apt (B). "A" is new client & "B" existing client. A & B 3 visits each to date - no resolution. 6 techs give scripted reasons i.e. - the AV techs say "there is a problem with wires being old - you need the old wire dept". Old wire department comes - "they didn't tell me B is a building - have to send a subcontractor." "I can only do private house wires." Reading the 6 different order sheets I notice info is always wrong- "phone agent" problem. Down 25 hours of time & $240 in tips (6 techs so far). I can't punish all techs for following orders they have been given by "phone agent". Comcast hired "White Fence" (customer solutions) to call me after follow-up survey re: B. Their Supervisor is going to listen to all of the recorded (by Comcast) phone calls with "phone agents" to identify problem (prompts me to reschedule B). Next day WF calls & says I should reschedule B. That was the timely solution to an "equipment agent" not showing up? Does WF fee get passed on to customers? "White Fence" listening to past conversations did not instill confidence. Currently waiting again for Comcast (A & B) and for our TV repair man - Comcast "special services" agent mistakenly disengaged Crestron disabling channel changing & on/off functions. Only hope this post helps those as frustrated as I. What can we do? hashtag Comcast? After 3 Comcast visits and no result our TV repairman says he rebooted box and now our Comcast services are restored in B. Incredible!!
__label__0 I had Comcast bundled services and was discontinuing them.  I had paid for service thru Nov 14.  I arranged for QWest to change my phone on Nov 10.  Comcast cut off my phone on Nov 5 so I was without phone for 5 days.  I returned Comcast's equipment and terminated all service on Nov 12.  Comcast sent me a bill with a Previous Balnce of $215.85 and credits for $137.98.  That left an amount due of $77.87.  My previous bill from Comcast showed a balance of $130.58 which was paid by credit card on Oct 16th.  Comcast bill did not indicate where the new $218.85 balance came from.  I called Comcast and they said their billing was correct.  They said I had unbundled my services so I owed more money.  I did not unbundle my services, I was discontinuing my services and I was paid thru Nov 14. I am not going to pay them anymore money.I am concerned that their bill wll go to collection agency and eventually damage my credit.
__label__0 I just got services with Comcast. I work and go to school. I can't go to the store or even call them. I got my bill and they wanted me to pay for a reconnection fee, two services fee and one for an additional TV line. The tech came to my home place. The cable all around my apartment (where my kids were playing and got hurt) because the tech didn't install it right! I tried to contact them and I have to go to the office for them to even look at my bill. I told the CSR on the live chat that I'll make my payment when my bill gets fixed. Why have the 24 hours support if they can't even answer questions and tell you to go to the office?
__label__0 I received a call several weeks ago from a Comcast telemarketer who offered me a "deal" for services I was not receiving.  He said that I would also get faster Internet service if I were to accept the deal.  Internet service is internet service--I can't understand why they were claiming that they can increase the speed.  That's ridiculous.  It makes me feel that they are holding out on me.I received a new Comcast bill and did not understand why I needed to pay more and exactly what I was paying for.  The young woman I spoke with was hard to understand--because the English was not that good and because she did not seem to understand the price structure.  She sent me to the Web site.  I navigated to that and had to put in my address and zip code to see prices, which makes me think that people are offered different prices depending on I really don't know what.So I saw that they are offering an incredible deal to new customers.  The cost of which (for the same services I get now) is half of what I pay.  There is a contract involved but the great pricing can last up to two years.  This is blatantly not fair.  That is like me going into a grocery store and paying a different price based on something like my hair color.  Service costs should be the same across the board.
__label__1 My modem is directly connected to my computer. I've had speed issues amounting to almost 5 visits from technicians. The customer service is impossible to talk to, and most of them aren't even from the states. I would switch from them to Verizon in a second if Verizon was available in my building. If you have a choice, do not choose Comcast. 93 dollars a month for speeds at 2.26 - 5.75 on the blast plan. The whole company is as crooked as government sanctioned organized crime.
__label__1 I called "Comjob" to advise them that my internet was slow and would often times just stop working. I was told by their "tech" that my computer was too old to handle the high bandwidth of the Comjob network. After all, they provide the fastest internet of any company in the country, right? If you doubt that, just ask them. What a laugh! My "old computer" was just two weeks old. But just to make sure, I brought it in to the store where I bought it, where repairs and support is offered. And when I told the tech what was told to me by Comjob, he laughed, shook his head and told me that is the standard answer when they can't fix the problem. He connected my computer to his company LAN and demonstrated to me there was nothing wrong with my computer. I called two more times about the computer connection and never had my matter resolved. I cancelled when AT&T offered UVERSE and have not regretted that decision. I also had problems with my Comjob TV service. Many stations were static and the "on demand" feature never worked. After a few years of putting up with this nonsense, I cancelled and went to AT&T and I have been happy ever since.
__label__1 Up until 5 years ago I had great experiences with Comcast. Slowly over those 5 years little things occurred and now are adding up... Sadly I have two options-- them or AT&T-- who is the less of two evils. Anyways... Now I am almost to my 20 year anniversary of being with company, MONTHS away, and I am leaving. After 20 years you would think they care about losing you-- not in the least bit. I have paid my bill on time every month until I had a little misfortune the past 7 months and got behind. I couldn't believe after I gave my loyalty all those years they wouldn't work with me at all on getting back on track. While customer service cried out apologies it was fake and underneath cold. Tonight when I called to get information on what I needed to do to have my account closed they offered up the information so quick it was easy to place order with AT&T. I figure I would rather get treated like ** by a company that I have no ties with than by a company that holds no value in a 20 year customer. It's truly crazy to me. Esp since the guy recognized the year my service began with them, yet didn't try to stop me from leaving. So long Comcast... I hope everyone realizes what an awful company you are and abandons your services. Maybe you would care then.
__label__1 He made a call and told me that the repair would be done between September 25th and October 9th. But they never showed, never called, and I never heard from Comcast until October 9th when I received an email informing me that the new repair date was October 16th. But they never showed for that one either and I never heard from them. To make a long story not so long, they also missed the next two appointments, the latest was yesterday October 21st. Never showed, never contacted me. Today I got an email from them stating that the repair was now rescheduled to be completed by November 13th. Today is October 22nd and this has been going on since early September and nothing's been done. And didn't think of it but no one ever gave me an order number either.
__label__0 Our Comcast service was turned off, so a representative left a notice on the door stating they needed to collect the boxes, my mother called the number on the notice and spoke with John. She informed him of the time that would be good to pick up the boxes, he stated he wouldnt be in the area at that time, but he would be doing another time and he would call her to see if she or myself maybe home doing that time. When he called my Mom informed him that no one was home and that we would take the boxes in to the service center, this must have been on a Thursday. On Sunday my 15 year old brother called my mom and told her the Comcast man had came and he had him gone from room to room with him and had taken the cable boxes. John should not have entered our home and went from room to room with 15 year old. I thought a person 18 or over had to be present and I didnt think they were allowed to enter my home and go room to room to get anything. I have complaint to Comcast and they said John supervisor would call, never heard from the supervisor. Last week another Comcast representative came to collect the boxes also, the boxes had been taken by John 2-3 week earlier. I called Comcast back again, and ask why was someone else at my home to collect boxes that had alright been collected, when she looked on their system it finally showed up the boxes where returned. The representative was very rude, I was told by her that a Comcast person can enter my home even if the isn't an adult and collect their equipment. I was very upset by their rudeness and lack of professionalism and lack of communication.
__label__0    I had Comcast Basic Cable for approximately twelve years and always paid my bills on time.In early 2009, I was not able to access the Internet on my home computer and after countless calls to MSN, my Internet provider at the time, was still not able to resolve the problem.  I assumed the cause of the problem was with the Internet provider, and, therefore, telephoned Comcast to inquire about their services.    They offered me Internet, telephone and cable service for a price of $70.00 for the year.    At that time, I told them I might be moving within the year and their representative told me to just disregard their one-year agreement form which they subsequently sent me by mail.   After signing up with Comcast, I discovered that I still wasn't able to get on the Internet, and their Technical Information Specialist told me to telephone their billing department to request that I not be charged for Internet services.   The bills I received from Comcast continued to show a charge for Internet service, and I faithfully paid all bills with the exception of the $21.00 a month for Internet service.     I moved to a new location not served by Comcast in mid-September 2009, and the bills continued to come.   I telephoned Comcast, and the representative told me to just disregard  the bills since my balance was zero.After returning from a ten-day trip in early October 2009, I received both a bill for $21.00 as well as a notice from a collection agency for the same amount.  As a result, I wrote a letter to the collection agency explaining the situation and also telephoned Comcast.   The representative at Comcast said that I did indeed still owe $21.00.  (I might add that the billing period was for October to November 2009, and my Comcast service ended on September 9, 2009.)
__label__1 Giving any stars is a ** joke, but you're forced to give one star minimum. If it were up to me, I'd give Comcast a negative 20. I signed up for Comcast, on 9/8/11. I called back to add a detail and right off the bat, the order was messed up. Good thing, I called back, right? I had signed up for the Triple-play package, which is TV, internet and phones. The next day, the subcontractor comes to do the installation and guess what? The order is still not right. He tells me that I have to call in. I know he's telling the truth because the guys aren't actual Comcast employees. I called them and "surprise", the package that I signed up for and what they say I got, are two totally different things.Bigger shock: the price they quoted me is for fewer channels than what I was told the day I placed the order. So now, they want to charge me $30.00 more for fewer channels. So, I have this Comcast ** in my house, now. We turn on the TV and the channels aren't all there, the DVR doesn't work and oh, by the way, I now have to purchase a router and all new wireless cards for the other computers in my house. I don't blame the guys who install the equipment. They are contracted out. Plus, I worked for Comcast briefly and I worked in Direct Sales, which are the people who deal with the subcontractors. So, FYI, I don't yell at these guys when ** gets screwed up. Customer Service is who you need to ream. Customer Service will say anything to get you off of the phone. I know that for a fact, because I was trained in Customer Service, too. They word the so-called "notes" so that when you call back to complain, which you will, I assure you, the notes are vague and don't come close to what you were told. These people can do whatever they want, to whomever they want, because people don't stand up to them. Ironically, the guy who installed our U-verse used to work for Comcast, so he and I talked shop. He left Comcast because he got tired of being cussed out over issues that Comcast so-called customer service had caused. See, the guys who install your service are only allowed to do what is put in the paperwork. Otherwise, they can get into trouble and lose their jobs. It's really easy to yell at them because they are a physical person, there in front of you, to take your anger out on. The bottom line is that Comcast has lousy service, they lie and they will rip you off, without blinking and they sleep fine at night. Funny thing is, they're losing money hand over fist, but they continue to run their business unethically. If we stand up and fight these companies when we get screwed over, we can do something about it! The problem is that people who want to put stuff past them and start fresh, so they let it go. This is our hard-earned money that they're stealing! I've seen many businesses, over the years, who went under because of their shady business practices and it comes back to bite them in the butt. They get away with it for awhile, but believe me, if we stand and fight the lying, thieving **, they, too will go under! Who's with me? And for the record, U-verse is much better. The connections are better; you can run multiple computers on your network, record 4 shows at a time. If you're watching TV; however, you can only record 3 while watching that 4th channel. Plus, my kids can set the DVR to record a show, and then watch it on their TVs, instead of using the living room's TV, which my husband and I use to watch. The picture quality is much better and you don't have to worry about outages, all the time, like you do with Comcast. Also, cable internet is hooked up to a hub, which means you share it with 4-6 other houses, on the average. That affects your internet speeds and can bog it down so much that even if you only have one computer in your house, you experience serious lag. Just imagine if you have more than one. U-verse reps are a lot more helpful and they try hard to fix problems and they will find a way to make you happy.
__label__1 I was a Comcast customer for over 30 years, the last 15 or so I paid $150 a month, never missed... When I recently moved, they didn't service the area I moved to, so I had to switch... Now they have me in collections for the equipment they say I didn't return (I have the UPS receipt) and the monthly fees for the balance of the 24 months they say I owe. I ain't going to pay them.
__label__1 Sales rep said high speed internet was included in the package I just signed up for. I discovered I was being charged for it on the bill. I called Comcast/Xfinity and they said it wasn't included and wouldn't make it right. I then had them take the high speed internet off and they said they would credit my bill and it would show up in 24 hours and I wouldn't need to pay it. I check a few days later and the charges are still on my account. I got on a chat call with a rep and told them my story and they told me they wouldn't make it right either and that it was still on my bill and I would maybe see it on my next bill as a credit. Not a very customer friendly company and don't back up what their sales reps promise.
__label__1 I started service with the GA Comcast service in Lawrenceville. I bought my own modem from Fry's Electronics before starting service with them. All was fine with service, billing - everything at that address. I moved to Cumming, GA and that was when things went bad. First of all, the account rep put on my service order that I needed a modem after telling her several times I owned one. When the tech arrived to set up my service, he saw that I already had a modem and had it properly notated on my account, so I was not charged for it the first month (April 2011) at my current address. I made the mistake of trusting it was off the rest of the time. When my bill went up after 6 months of promo time, I logged in and looked at my bill finding the modem lease fee on my bill. I called and was told they had to escalate it and would take 2-3 weeks to get resolved. After no response for 2 months, I called back in and was told it was not resolved yet. However, it should be soon and I was welcome to stop paying for the modem as it would be credited back to my account. After 3 more months of this, I called in again. This time, I got a competent CSR who made the corrections. However, when they reactivated my service properly, somehow they entered my modem as a rental. I had to take my modem to my local office with proof of purchase to prove it was a retail, not theirs. The ladies at the office were quite helpful and put the proper notation in my account. I was told I had to call back in to corporate to have them correct the billing and listing. I did that, however, the CSR said she didn't have the authority and a supervisor would have to fix it. It got corrected without contacting me. I called back in 2 days later to find this out, but the credit for the nearly year of paying has not been taken care of. I was again told a manager had to do this and would call me within 3 business days. I told them I would register a complaint if no call within that time. Obviously, not taken care of.
__label__1 After having had tremendous difficulty with Comcast's cable TV service over the past 15 years, I'd heard that they were improving customer service and decided to try it one last time. I use their high-speed internet service and have had little trouble with it. The install technician make a call to his supervisor after having a problem getting the right remote code for the TV. He didn't tell me what the obscure remote code was. Within 72 hours, the remote stopped working and a few minutes later, the cable went out. Of course, all of the customer service representatives were busy - once I got a recording giving a series of steps to perform to get service working again (there was some problem in the area). Zip, Nada. Next, I called and waited several more times, eventually waiting for over 35 minutes for a representative to answer the phone. She ran me through a bunch of steps she was reading from a screen that I'd already tried and eventually she decided I needed to return the remote to Comcast's office 20 miles away. This, of course, even I knew wasn't the issue because the downstairs remote wasn't turning the cable on either. After hours of struggling, I decided to take the equipment back. Of course, they require that you to call someone specific so they can route you through a "retention" person. The last time I'd been required to cancel via a "retention" person, she tried to persuade me to keep service by characterizing going without TV as "extreme". Which is, of course, very silly. Once through these hoops (funny how it's chronically downright difficult to get through to them, but their "retention specialists" manage to answer pretty quickly), it's easy at the store because they don't want you complaining in front of the new customers there. Never again.
__label__1 We had already agreed for Package X over the phone but in person, she said that it's better to get Package Y.  When I said that I'm not interested in Package Y, she made her voice louder and said that I should listen to what she says first before I talk. I found that to be very, very rude.I agreed to get Package Y (which was Internet + cable), but when the cable guy came, he said that the order did not indicate that we ordered for cable TV and Internet.  He was only prepared for Internet.  Clearly, there was a miscommunication.The cable guy did not receive orders for a router, but we clearly indicated that we want a wireless connection. How can we use Wi-Fi without a router?  Monica ordered for a router.  We asked for the tracking number on Day A.  She was only able to give us the tracking number on Day B.  We tried to track our package but UPS said that they cannot track that particular number.I contacted Monica but she said that was the number that UPS gave.  Instead of helping us get the router (which was supposed to be delivered on August 31), she just gave us the customer service number.The customer service people directed me to three different people before I was finally able to talk to a person. It took them 10 minutes.  The technical service person said that according to their records, UPS could not find our address and that the router was not delivered. I asked for a tracking number and that number was different from what Monica gave us.  We tried tracking it but the package is still not trackable.  The technical service person said that the router could possibly still be in the office but she's not sure.  I should call her again tomorrow.The LAN connection is also unpredictable. Sometimes, we couldn't get a good signal.  It has caused me and my housemates a great deal of inconvenience and we are appalled by the quality of service we are getting from Comcast.We had to share one cable and take turns in using the computer when we are paying for Wi-Fi service.  We need to get in contact with our relatives and friends overseas but we cannot do that at our convenience because of the poor quality of service we are getting.
__label__1 I have been with Comcast for 3 years, now they call it xfinity. My bill was getting out of hand. So in November I let it get shut off. I had tried to get help to lower the bill with a new plan, to be told your whole bill had to be paid off so I did that. Went back they had another story, mind you they charge a month in advance. Who's to say that you will have comcast the following month. While off in the month of November, I called to get a different plan. I asked the young man with the payment will it clear up everything. He told the next bill will be due January 9, 2015. They sent me a bill owing November 244 dollars along with the January bill, they charged me for no service in November. Will not take it off, then I have been told by some of the most disrespectful people I have ever heard, that T.V. is for people who can afford it and you really don't need T.V. I'm now writing letter to BBB attorney general of my state and everyone else even the FCC. Like I told the young man today, you people talk all of that trash because you are behind a phone line, wouldn't it be something if we could come through that line.
__label__0 I had Comcast cable, internet, & telephone service at my residence.  It took them 5 on-site service attempts to get these services correct.  1) Brought wrong cable box, needed HD/DVR and didn't get the phone connection into the existing lines to work on all jacks, 2) Brought correct box, couldn't fix phone, lost phone service intermittently, 3) Still couldn't fix bad phoine service, would stop working for hours/days, 4) Bad cable signal due to bad cable, finally got all phone outlets working, 5) finally got good phone signal.  They had to twice to correct charges for installation & repair.  The on-line software GUI for checking voicemail, in/out calls, blocking calls, etc...never worked 100%.  Had three open software issues with their internet GUI.  After the three issues, still couldn't do some of the on-line GUI options, i.e. call blocking, forwarding, and had intermittent issues with voicemail.  After all of the issues, now that I moved and disconnected on August 15th 2008, they tried to say I didn't turn in the cable modem. Since I moved 850 miles away to a statew they do not service, they gave me the run around for four weeks that I owed them money for the modem, just because I couldn't find the triplicate copy of the receipt that I turned it in along with the two receivers.  Well, as soon as I found the receipt, they said, it was their mistake - never had to show it to them.  They said they found the modem finally by its serial number. Anyway, now I needed a refund of almost $139 for monthly fees I'd already paid ahead.  Well, still to this day Dec. 5th, even after seven phone calls to customer service, have not received any refund check.  They claimed on the first few calls it would take 4-6 weeks to get it, after 6 weeks, they said 6-8 weeks, after 8 weeks they said up to 12 weeks, on the 12 week day, they claimed to have cut a check and were mailing it.  That was 2 weeks ago - still no check!  Amazing incompetence level of Comcast!  I will never ever use them again.Had to come home from work three times during the day to work with service tech.  I am out almost $139 for past due overpayment.
__label__1 We switched to Comcast over a month ago and it has been one of the... if not THE WORST experiences I've had with ANY company in my life. An installer and/or technician has been to our house a total of six (6) different times to fix our cable/internet and we are still having problems. Installer will come to check the connections and say, "we are not getting a good signal from the street." They will pass the buck to the "Guys is the Big Truck" as they call them. These technicians will come out check the connection from the street and say the signal is good (or that they fix something) and arrange for the installer to come back out. This has happened 3 times we still don't have a solid connection! Unbelievable... need more internet options other than AT&T and Comcast.
__label__1 My name is Tiwana and I am a new Comcast Cable customer. I am writing you this letter to inform you how I was treated as a new customer with Comcast Cable. My first phone call to Comcast was around on 5/7/2013, and my first appointment was scheduled on 5/11/2013. On this day, I was very excited because I had waited for services and was excited about getting new cable service as I had been with AT&T for the past 4 years. When the technicians arrived (4 of them), they quickly stated that we had no signal and the work ceased at that point. They advised me that they would have to send someone back, later on in the day to setup the service. A gentleman did arrive a few hours later but left without advising us of anything and also not installing the service. I called Comcast back and spoke with someone who guaranteed me that my services would be fully installed no later than Sunday, 5/12/2013 (all 4 rooms). He also stated that he would call and check on me by Monday, 5/13/2013, to make sure that everything was done. Since I was provided this information, I called into work on Monday, 5/13/2013, and took the day off. I called Comcast back again on Monday and was told that the only thing that could be done is to schedule another appointment for later on in the week. This really frustrated me, so I requested to speak with a supervisor. On this day, I spoke with Tracy ** and was told that there was nothing she could do, and I would have to setup another appointment which would be 5/17/2013. This was unacceptable to me, because I had already set an appointment that was not kept. Ms. ** stated that she would escalate this issue and that someone would be calling me back. I never received a call back. I contacted Comcast again Tuesday, 5/14/2013, and spoke with someone named George that apologized for all the inconvenience and promised credits on my account. Credits are nice but means nothing if you cant use the service. George also advised me to just keep the appointment scheduled for 5/17/2013, because there was nothing else he could do. At that time, I confirmed that they would be installing all 4 rooms in my home. I was told yes. On May 17, 2013, someone came to my home to install the security system and only one room in my home. At that time, I advised the gentlemen that I had a total of 4 rooms and was told that he only had a work order for 1 room. By this time, I am extremely frustrated because I knew that this was not how you treat new customers. I then called Comcast back and spoke with someone, who again apologized for the inconvenience and offered me another appointment. By this time, I did not want to set another appointment. The only appointment they could give me was the next week. I then thought about canceling the service. Why? I have been in customer service for 14 years and knew that this was not how you treat a new customer. I knew the CEO of Comcast never thought their new customers would be treated this way. Because my family really needed the service, I picked myself back up and set an appointment for Saturday, 5/25/2013. I knew the difficulties I had previously, so I followed up to make sure that my appointment was set. On Wednesday, 5/22/2013, I spoke with someone named Alfred, who confirmed my appointment for 5/25/2013 between 8am-10am. I also confirmed that they would be installing the additional 3 rooms that were never completed. Alfred confirms everything and again apologized.On Thursday, 5/23/2013, someone shows up at my house (while Im at work) stating that we had technical difficulties. Luckily my husband was home, but we had no technical difficulties. The gentleman then stated that the appointment had been set for 5/22/2013 and not the date I was told of, 5/25/2013. He had no boxes to install as he was only there because the work order showed technical difficulties. This enraged me because this is not how you do business. A new customer should not be treated this way. When I returned home, I quickly contacted Comcast and requested to speak with a supervisor. I spoke with Jill first who stated that I never had an appointment scheduled for 5/25/2013. I was then transferred to her supervisor Jason. Jason apologized to me and stated that he would make sure that someone would be at my home to finish the installation on 5/25/2013 between 8am-10am. To ensure this was done, he also provided me his managers name which was Jerry. On Saturday, 5/25/2013, I called after 10am to confirm that my appointment would go as scheduled as the installer was now late. I spoke with William who confirmed the appointment between 8am-10am and asked me to give them more time to show up. Nobody ever showed up. I allowed some more time to pass. In the afternoon, I called back and spoke with someone named Jean who stated that the appointment was never set. I no longer wanted a supervisor and wanted a manager now. I spoke with a manager named Eric ID# ** who told me that he would take care of everything. By this time, it was 7:30pm in the evening. He stated that he would have someone come out in the evening. I asked him when would be the latest they could install my cable and was told by midnight. Per manager Eric, someone would be out by midnight. I was also provided with ticket# **. Nobody ever came nor did I receive any call back from anyone. To whoever is reading this letter, I appreciate your time. I just had to let you know that Comcast has lost a customer that truly wanted their service. First I was angry and then upset. Now, my feelings are just hurt. How can you treat a new customer like this? The way I have been treated is totally unacceptable. This is just not the way to keep customers. I am writing this letter to hopefully help the next customer that is treated this way. All I wanted was cable in all four of my rooms and the security system. Now, it truly hurts me that I must take my business elsewhere. Thank you so much for you time. I just had to let you know what happened to me so it wont happen to someone else.
__label__1 I signed up for Comcast Internet when I moved into my new home, and was overjoyed to have fast internet again after being without it for a few months. I signed up for their 50mbps Blast! plan, and had a tech come install it, but used my own modem. Everything was just fine until 7 days in, I received an e-mail from Comcast warning me that I was near my "data cap". I was utterly confused and immediately logged in to my account to find out what it was referring to. I had never even HEARD of any company having a data cap on their internet service.Sure enough, 7 days in, I was at 268 GB out of the 300 GB allowed. I instantly saw red. I did some research and was horrified to learn of their data cap policies and getting charged overages. I wasn't even using what I considered a large amount of data. Even with their highest internet tier, the cap is only 600 GB. with 50+ mbps, that is frighteningly simple to surpass in just days. All of the information I acquired about their cap was from forums. There was little to no useful information on their actual website to better inform me as to what my options were.I don't understand how it is even legal to instill such an abysmal cap in the first place, much less not make you aware of such a thing until you are virtually past it. This data cap combined with TERRIBLE customer service, almost daily e-mails reminding me about my bill (which obviously was never paid), and other shady tactics they use to rob people of hundreds of dollars, forced me to switch to a company with a substantially lower internet speed. I have no data cap however, and am still perfectly able to use the internet for everything I need/want on a daily basis. My opinion is that everyone else should do the same to give Comcast and companies like them to put an end to this kind of nonsense, and actually serve their customers, instead of mistreat/cheat them. AVOID COMCAST AT ALL COSTS!
__label__1 When calling Comcast (already have cable and Internet) they offered to bundle and offered phone service. They confirmed (I have a copy of the Internet chat with the Comcast rep to verify) that I would not lose phone service while they converted to comcast. My mother in law had a health emergency 12 days later and the phone was dead. I called comcast and could not get through to a person. Once I finally did, they would not connect me to a person that could help, despite me asking repeatedly asking for a manager. I had to drive my loved one on the hospital because 911 would not work. She arrived late and it has jeopardized her recovery. I am in the process of consulting with a lawyer from the Department of Justice. Comcast should be shut down.
__label__1 My internet key sticker on the bottom was worn out, so I called customer service and was put on hold for about 30 mins. Finally someone got to me after a half hour. The person couldn't even speak English. After being transferred to another person that also could not understand, they transferred me and by the third time the person was at least semi fluent in English. I had to give them a list of my address, name, phone #, SS# and account #, for the woman to tell me it was located under my modem. I told her I knew that but the sticker was worn out. Then she said she can't give me that # over the phone. But yet they needed me to give them my SS# over the phone to someone in Abu Dhabi. I hope more providers start entering the market where I live. I will never come back to Comcast again.
__label__0 i cannot check e-mail during the day.I work at night so during buisness hours I surf the internet and catch up with e-mail.When I try to connect to the e-mail server I get a default message that states cannot connect to inbox at this time try again later.This is a home use connection so I get bumped from the server by buisness customers.I should not have to contine paying full price for internet if I do not get full service.
__label__1 Comcast is in charge of programming display, but somehow can't coordinate when to start and stop recorded shows. I am ** tired of going to watch a DVR recorded show only to find out that the show was delayed and Comcast recorded by time - not the actual show. In this age of technology, they should be able to do better.
__label__1 On or around August 19th, 2011, I requested service with Comcast. On August 20th, my service was connected in my home. On or around August 24, 2011, I received my first bill with a bill date of August 21, 2011 with the bill being due on the 10th of September. Two weeks later, I received another bill from Comcast with a due date of September 24th.On September 21, I contacted Comcast via live chat to inquire about the change in my bill date. I was informed by Josie ** that the first bill from Comcast is prorated depending on when you requested service. My first bill was not, I paid for a full month's worth of service. Josie informed me that my service billing cycle is from August 21-September 19 and September 20-October 10. I again asked about the change in my bill date from the 21st to the 7th. I then stated that my being billed on the 7th of the month is not one full month's worth of billing and that it is actually 17 days that I am being billed for since my bill is due on the 24th. I then asked how can Comcast bill me on the 7th when I did not request my initial service until the 20th of the month? After reading all of the complaints against Comcast, I am astonished that they are able to get away with all they have been doing. One customer through out the possibility of a class action lawsuit against Comcast, and I believe that customer has the right idea.
__label__1 In March 2014, I got something in the mail that offered my a $200.00 if I switch my cable and internet service to Comcast. In the fine print it stated that I would have to be customer for 90 days. July 02, 2014. I called about the VISA gift card ($200.00), I was told I would not get it. I pay my bill on time each month. When I attempted to call anyone at Comcast each person doesn't have any idea what I'm talking about. I have been hang up on 3 times and have been on the phone with Comcast since 10am and it's now 10:53 am in my area. Please beware of this "so called DEAL". I have ask them to disconnected my services. The company (Comcast) has told me I would have to pay a disconnection fee. On top of me not getting the gift card I was promise. I now hate Comcast. The integrity of this Company is shot with me. I just want out and have nothing else to do with Comcast.
__label__1 I have been facing extremely slow internet connection and frequent disconnections for the last two and a half months. I have spent at least 10 hrs on the call to their customer care. Three technician visits and one scheduled, the trouble with service continues. Since I didn't get any internet they promised to compensate for the time and here they start malpractices as I should put it. Compensation did show up on the online account so I didn't pay anything for that month and I was at least relieved. But when I was to pay this months bill everything from the last month appeared back and an additional 70$ charge was mentioned for technicians visit.I did what any troubled consumer would do, I called their billing department. What happened on the call was shocking least to say. The lady on the phone kept on reading from the present bill and was absolutely deceitful & impolite. She kept on heckling me throughout the call and was venting spleen. After 45 minutes of discussion she offered me to take out the technician fee and told me to pay for rest of the bill even for the time when I couldn't use the internet.The conclusion is, cheating the consumer is not going to fructify and with a bitter heart I am saying that if you can't provide the services and solutions then don't promise to your customer. You exist because we are using your services. The day we decide to move away you will cease to exist. I leave the decision to the readers of this review to decide for themselves whether to back the unethical practices.
__label__1 My internet does not work. I work from my home and need it to perform my job. I have been trying to get through to them all day. Very long wait times. I got through and they hung up on me. They are also my phone provider so they certainly know how to call me back but they made no attempt. I went to the web page and all I could find was self service information telling me how to do their job for them troubleshooting their equipment. I can't even get through to stop the auto pay on my account. What is a consumer's recourse? They have direct access to my $$ for payment but do not have to provide the service I have contracted them to. Read the internet, I am not the only one. How do they get away with this? A rating of "1" was too generous but it was my only option...
__label__0 I'm a tenent in a house that has Comcast cable/internet.  When they first came to install the cable/internet, I had given them my number as a temporary contact number so that they could reach me when they came to my house.  Once the services were installed (I'm greatly pleased with their services) I continues to receive calls with anything associated with the account. Not only would Comcast use their automated system to call me and put me on hold for over 10 minutes each time, but they refused to remove my number from the primary contact number.  A company should call the LANDLORD if there is a problem with mortgage payments, cable/internet billing, water supply, electricity...anything!  It is NOT the responsibility of the tenent to handle any billing collecton/other issues and do your job for you. Comcast won't remove my number from their contact list and expect me to navigate their jumbled hierarchy of tele-networks for a mistake that is theirs--a mistake I have brought to their attention just to help out.  Comcast may understand good cable/internet, but their customer service is HORRIBLE.Wasting my valuable time....I don't need to be talking to Comcast while at work over something that this stupid company cannot resolve.
__label__0 I have been harassed by Comcast and threatened to have my internet disconnected for supposedly too much internet usage.  They shot an obscene number of gigs which they are claiming my family uses more space that my hard-drive even contains.  I was told when I signed up for Comcast that there was no limit to downloading and just for the record, I do not download anything illegal.  If I download something it's because I payed for it or I download virus protections and software updates.  When I asked to have this sent in writing, they completely denied me.  They said that they don't send that stuff out!  If they are not sending their customers download limits, then how are we supposed to know?  They told me whether or not I pay for it, they don't allow it.  Isn't that a breach of contract under Comcast's fault? I use my computer for business purposes the majority of the time and I have a disabled child that is computer dependent because of severe handwritten skills; he needs the computer.  Comcast and their phone operators did not wish to comply with my requests at all.  What can I do and what are my rights?
__label__1 Houston has 2 internet providers - AT&T and Comcast. Both are horrendous, unreliable, and have terrible customer support. Being forced to choose one over the other makes question if we're really a democracy. I've wasted sooo much time and money trying to get decent, reliable service that if I was getting paid to wrestle with Comcast, I'd be a millionaire.
__label__1 Since May 28, 2011, I have lost my wireless internet connection at least 10 times (probably more).  It requires a service call to my home each time, usually three days after I call customer service.  Multiple times, techs have arrived and did not have the equipment to fix the problem.  This is because the service orders were written incorrectly.  Hence, another service order had to be written and another tech had to come back on another day.  This has been going on for 3 months.  And again today, I cannot access the internet from my wireless laptop.  I am using someone else's internet connection to contact you.  I give up.   How can Comcast get away with charging the high rates that they do, and not provide the service they promise?  Please help if you can.
__label__5 First off, the fact that their product wasn't working properly was already a bad start and secondly, terrible customer service just ruined the whole mood. Heres what happened. My Internet was not working properly and when I had called the customer service, they were absolutely wonderful - treated me with respect and all. But here comes the bad part. They directed me to the Advanced Wireless Department and some whacko picks up the phone half-awake answering the phone with a very dreadful "Hello?" Very professional (Sarcasm). So I was telling him about what was happening with my Internet and halfway in, I hear the guy yawn and hang up the phone! The worst part about it is that this guy might be doing this to OTHER customers with no punishment whatsoever. Goes to show Comcast hires some very bad workers. Disappointed.
__label__1 I made a payment on my account and they still suspended our services. I called in and no one was able to fix the issue in restoring our services. I was hung up on by customer service reps after experiencing serious rudeness. I was told to call collections and was on hold for 43 minutes and then I was disconnected. I just called back at approximately 1 am and was told that their system was updating and to call back again. We have made a total of 5 calls to Comcast in less than 12 hours with no results.
__label__0 One of the 3 cable boxes quit working on 8/29/09. I decided to stop the service on that box. I returned the box to Comcast on 10th St., waiting in line for 45 minutes. I also wanted to downgrade my plan to delete premium channels. The representative said I had a plan and I couldn't do that now. I have had Comcast since 7/2007. Now, the 2nd Comcast cable box is not working and they cannot come out until Monday at 1-3pm and won't adjust my bill until after the correction. I do not recommend Comcast and will change service if the service is not corrected before Monday.
__label__0 After being lied to over the last 1.5+ years, I finally chose to terminate Comcast cable TV and today, October 26. 2010, was the date for action. I first called to be sure that I could terminate my television portion and second, to be sure of cost and availability of internet and telephone service. Once it was confirmed that service was available, I proceded to enter a contract for satellite dish service starting tomorrow. I then spent additional time by visiting my local Comcast service center in Freeport, IL, to make sure what equipment need to be returned, etc. This is where the problem started. They would not allow me to contract for partial service, phone and internet.They told me that the only way I could do this was to wait 30 or more days without any services! They tried to tell me that I would lose the telephone number that I have had for over 25 years if I terminated service, I advised them I did not believe they could keep my phone number not allowing me to switch it. I also let them know that I did not think that trying to "hold me hostage" with these threats was very becoming of them.I then spent over 107 minutes on the phone with Comcast trying to terminate or trim services from the $201+ per month contract that they pushed me into in July 2009 if I remember correctly. After all, it has been many months and many lies since communications began last year. I could go on and on about how Comcast treated me and I have been a customer with them for close to 10 years in Illinois and for far longer at a second residence in Florida. 
__label__1 I'm 63 years old and have never worked with a company worse than Comcast. Comcast insists on charging me a monthly modem rental fee on a non existing modem. They say I have two modems? Both are the same model with a serial number off by one letter?? The truth is, on May 26, 2013 I purchased a modem through Amazon for $66.91. My wife called in the information so Comcast could set the modem up. The number was read wrong and then immediately corrected (contained D not O). The service rep, instead of correcting the number added another modem with the corrected number. Every couple of months Comcast tries to charge me for a non existing modem. It usually takes several calls and a couple of hours of my time to get it corrected. Online it still shows two modems on my account. Comcast won't take it off. Under the fictitious modem data usage always says "We're sorry. We can't load your usage meter right now." GEE I WONDER WHY!
__label__1 My service went out on Saturday Jan. 30, called CSR and they said ck connections like a typical scripted response. Connections dont unscrew by themselves. It was working Friday night. Then they said it was not on their end it must be a defective DVR player. The next day (Super Bowl Sunday) it worked fine all day. I decided to follow up and downgrade to HD box instead of DVR in case the problem was intermittent. I was mislead years ago to have 3D function, this upgrade was necessary. I later found out only a few stations are broadcasting in 3D, because it has to be filmed in 3D. O.k. Ive been paying ten dollars extra for three years for nothing. Technician said it was not his job to explain recording functions or even offered online instruction availability. I returned the DVR box Sat. Feb. 7. Person assured me, just connect coaxial cable to input and HDMI port to TV then wait 30 minutes to activate new box. I followed instructions and no signal. Again the same dude said the scripted response, and wanted to schedule a technician the following Tuesday, and only if box was defective would there be no charge otherwise 30-50 dollars. I figured it out myself and now it works. They did not go in to rewiring due to Blue Ray device, and surround sound. I was fuming for an hour trying different combinations, and now it works. However I want to take this opportunity to vent my frustration. First you have people that barely speak English talking to customers. All they know is apologize and send a technician. If not for my diligence and electronic experience, a person would have been out of luck until next week and wiring changes would have cost 50 dollars. I know thats good for the corporate profit, but what about customer happiness dealing with your company? Not wanting to be less than constructive in my criticism, perhaps a duty technician could have talked me through on the phone. I hate to think you would refuse that simple solution for corporate greed and the C.E.O.'s worship of the almighty dollar!
__label__1 Comcast, your service really makes you the ABSOLUTE worst company ever! I can't understand how you continue to succeed in business by providing the worst of the worst customer service I have ever seen. No one can help solve a situation, you need at least 10 phone calls with multiple hand-offs where you need to repeat your story again and again and again... well you get it. I am sure you have all experienced it.You are willing to take our payment, did not apply it to the correct account, kept an old account opened when they were supposed to close it and now service is not working. Comcast, or Xfinity - whatever you changed your name to in hopes of having a better reputation, instead of a name change you need to have a business consultant come in or take a few customer service classes or let customers speak to managers who can make a decision or help fix a problem. Billing transfers to support, support transfers to billing, get it together! Instead of the associate not being empowered enough to determine what needs to be done on the phone calls, they all seem to abruptly disconnect. Why not just get a manager, someone from billing and someone from support on the line to hash out the issue, determine a resolution and then take action. This would cost you, the company, less time and money, the customer less frustration and your reputation might actually improve.Other businesses would not be as fortunate (if that is what you want to call it) to still be making a profit. The numbers we have been told to call (not transferred to) include: 866-200-6733, 800-325-7264, 877-896-8678, 877-842-6622, 866-203-8766. We have made multiple call backs (mostly due to disconnections). At what point can customers bill you for their labor in trying to get your assistance on a service you provide? That would be a fair, after all, you charge rates for connections and support depending on what it is.
__label__1 Only company that could provide service in my area so, against my better judgment, I went ahead with them. Unable to get it done online (interaction #1) because the "chat" person could not set me up without charging for the "home installation package" which is just a bunch of wires they send to you that everyone already has (scam #1) So I call on the phone (interaction #2) and the associate tells me I need the faster package that's $49.99 instead of the advertised 3/Mbps pkg. advertised because I have a lap-top (scam #2). I refuse and tell him I want the $19.99 and tell him I have my own modem and will set it up myself. He can't transfer me to set-up person so I have to call another number (interaction #3). I call and the tech "sets it up" and I'm able to go to 2 websites which "confirms that it works fine" (scam #3). Soon after, I realize that it's going on and off and timing out b/c it's just not working. Call back (interaction #4) and trouble shoot with another tech for 30 mins or so and she says "everything is fine" but it isn't. I ask is my router supported? She says "yes". So I have to have a tech come out to the house (earliest is in 3 days). Tech comes out (interaction #5) looks at modem and says "everything looks good here" goes outside and replaces some "really old equipment" but does not specify say what he did then says "okay...everything's good" before I have a chance to double check, he's gone (scam #3). Called 3 times that night (interaction # 6, 7, 8) and all the reps say they spoke with a dispatcher and the driver will call me to come back but he never does. Call another rep the next AM (interaction #9) and in 10 seconds the rep says "oh, you have an outdated modem, you need DSSI 3.0". So I go to Best Buy and buy a $130.30 Motorola modem (because I'm sure as hell not gonna give those bastards at Comcast the monthly rental fee for one of theirs) bring it home and call Comcast (interaction #10). The nice lady began the process and I quickly became disconnected. I call back (interaction #11) and another lady walks me through the process again and after 50 mins still cannot get it working. I immediately ask her to transfer me to cancel my service to which she nicely says sure and apologizes for like the tenth time. I'm on hold for 15 mins when she come back and asks me my zip code?? (Which I've uttered no less than 20 times throughout this sage) and apologizes again. Another 20 mins go by and I hang up. I call back (interaction #12) and am waiting on hold for 8 mins (promised 3-5 min wait from the automated lady) and lose the call in the elevator. I call back (interaction #13) and ask to be called when the rep was ready. They call back (interaction #14), and I cancel the service. I demand (politely) that I be billed nothing for this fiasco (m.b. guarantee per the TV ad) and she assures me I won't. Is the saga over? Will I be billed? Only time will tell. I think I was apologized to 30 times (no exaggeration) over these 14 interactions. However, it is just window dressing. A thinly veiled attempt at feigning good customer service when not one person I spoke with really attempted to fix my problem.
__label__1 Where do I begin. I cancelled my account before moving in August. I paid the final bill. Well come October I get a call saying I owe. I had them mail me the bill and I paid what was left. Towards November I had debt collectors calling me saying I owe Comcast. I called Comcast and they said they owed me money. In December I get another collection call. I had that collector stay on the phone while I called Comcast to have them him they owed me money. Which they did. I check my credit score today and it showed that Comcast had sent my account to debt collectors saying I still owe money. The amount of $104. I call Comcast and all they say is, "Sorry we forgot to update your account. It is updated now. You should be good in three days." Sorry is all I get for you ruining my credit score and 6 months of this. Comcast literally has the worst customer service of any place I've ever worked with. They don't care about their customers.
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer since 1975 (formerly Highland Video before acquisition). My monthly pricing seemed to steadily increase until I finally called to ask for an explanation. After getting nowhere with their customer service, and continually trying to stop them from trying to upgrade me, I finally told them to simply give me the same basic deal that they advertise on TV. Basic cable, internet and phone (Triple Play). The "Basic package. I was told that my internet would slow down, I could no longer make long distance phone calls and I would receive a lot less channels for which I replied "FINE". I was then told that I would have to turn in my HD equipment, then the representative hesitated and said "oh never mind, you don't have HD equipment". It didn't register at the time, until I printed out all of my past statements and noticed an alarming trend. Somewhere along the line, someone from Comcast entered data that placed me into the HD category. I do not own HD TV's. I started looking at my bills and noticed that for years I was bring charged $170.49 per month for HD Preferred Service. Once I called to seek an explanation for the constant increases, I was placed in the "basic" package for $92.95 per month for which I have been paying since. The overcharges were in my mind intentional. Being a Senior Citizen, I am very angry and wonder just how many other people are overcharged for services not rendered. I feel that several thousand dollars in overcharges have been sent to Comcast in a timely fashion, never late, always on time. For being a loyal customer, I get the short end of the stick. I am contacting the BBB and also the FCC.
__label__0  Our service in the area of Mandarin has become unacceptable.  Over the past several months, our outages have increased to near daily.  The internet service has become increasingly slower.   Recently, we were without telephone service for five (5) days due the inability of Comcast to provide a service technician.    Comcast, by our selection, provides our telephone, internet, and cable television service.  We, without fail, pay our monthly service charges of over $194.  However, we continue to have these problems.  Upon calling the service department and getting routed through your telephone tree to the correct department, they have no answers other than there is an outage in Mandarin.  Finally, today, after I was quite abrupt with one of your customer service representatives; I was told that the service department has known of the problems on Node 21 in Mandarin, but it is working by the time the technician arrives.   I have asked on countless occasions to speak to someone other than the customer service representative that answers the telephone.  But, I am told consistently that there is no one else available.  I am informed that my concern will be e-mailed--but there is no guarantee that my call will be returned or that I will be contact.  Indeed they were correct--I have not been contacted by anyone in Comcast management. Consequently, since no one has ever called to discuss this problem further, I am filing a complaint with not only the Better Business Bureau, but also with the State of Florida Insurance Commission and with the Federal Trade Commission.  I feel confidently that you will find time to respond to their investigations. As I have been for the past several months, I welcome any communications with Comcast management. Family left unprotected due to alarm service using Comcast Telephone Service. Inability of wife (Operating Room Nurse) to receive calls on evenings and weekends while on call. 
__label__1 Endless hold time, outright lying - it's never their problem. If you want a case study of what NOT to do, look at Xfinity. But since they bought up all the other providers, they have a legal monopoly - would LOVE to cut their cord but need internet access. They hold you over a barrel, insanely high fees, endless surcharges, bad service. They regularly throttle down the service, then deny it. I have the logs from my benchmarking - at least 4 times a week they throttle back. Piss poor. They rape the user. Down at least 3 times a week - then they deny it. Wish to hell Cox operated here.
__label__1 Comcast created a new account for us when we moved from one house to another. In the process, they deleted our old email addresses and have been unable to restore them. Starting on May 18, we have been calling and asking for this to be corrected. We keep being told that it will be taken care of, and that someone from the "tier 2 email department" will call us to confirm. This never happens, we've called repeatedly, and now, nine days later, we're on hold once more, being told we will be called within 7-10 business days, not the original 72 hours promised. There is never the opportunity to talk to anyone that can actually perform the action required. Horrible, horrible customer service.
__label__0 Once I started my Comcast account, I was promised a 100 dollar rebate back if I would deposit a 100 dollars. I spoke to a Justin ** on 6/6/11. He told me I would get my 100 dollars back by the week's end. When I called the company today, I was told there was no rebate check for me and they treated me very rude. When I said I would reach out to someone else to get my rebate, they simply said go ahead. I hope that you all can help me get my 100 dollar rebate from them. I was unable to have my co-payment and therefore is unable to get my hospital appointment and treatment. My co-payment is $75.00. I was depending on my rebate check to cover my co-payment. Now, I don't have it.
__label__0    I have been working for Comcast for almost 7 years and due to the decline of the economy, feel my job was being pushed out the door and finding a way to terminate/fire me for my longtime employment. Back in August 2008, hit a deer on I-90 near Ritzville, WA which has been documented by the "Washington State Patrol" of which came out to the scene of where the accident took place and low and behold finding gasoline pouring out of the gas tank of the vehicle, which posed a safety hazard. Keep in mind my partner and I were coming back from our 2 week vacation, which during this time called my employer to let them know the status of where I was at, since I was out of vacation and flex time.This being said 4 days later while the car was in the shop returned to work the following Tuesday of that next week and was put on a written for attendance, which months later after filled out a employee appraisal of my supe on Graveyard, a week later I was called in the office with my reporting supervisor and her boss in reference to what they considered a "Moment of misery" as they say, which moved me over to a final written. Just this last week, called on the carpet again the week of the 16th-20th of March which we both listened to the call and confirmed one call was a moment of misery which I am not doubting, however I was also accused of recording my customer calls that I received in the call center, which I never did or would. The other call was a situation where my new boss working day shift stated it was a basic, instead submitted the call anyway which turned out to be another "Moment of Misery" call which as of 03/23/2009 was terminated for "Comcast Customer Interaction Policy" & "Code of Conduct."This being said 4 days later while the car was in the shop returned to work the following Tuesday of that next week and was put on a written for attendance, which months later after filled out a employee appraisal of my supe on Graveyard, a week later I was called in the office with my reporting supervisor and her boss in reference to what they considered a "Moment of misery" as they say, which moved me over to a final written.

__label__1 I subscribe to Comcast Internet service. Lately, I have been losing signal occasionally and also my Internet service.  I have made repeated calls about the outages with no resolution.  Today, I was told that my modem is bad. After checking with people knowledgeable about cable modems; I was convinced that it's working fine. What a bunch of losers Comcast is.   They're greedy and dishonest.  If you can get service elsewhere, I advise you to do so.  I already changed my TV to satellite service; more channels, less expensive, and more reliable service-- believe it or not.
__label__0  I have sinced called 4 other times with no conclusion at all. I finally did receive a credit from Mary (employee # 24464) for 1 of the HDTV boxes which she was able to see I never had. But that is it. They still will not take off the 1 HDTV box and the HDTV service, they also mentioned that if I want them to come pick up this box they will charge me. This is very frustrating. I only ordered triple play for 99.00 so this is all I should be responsible for and I should not have to pay for them to come pick up this HDTV box and give me the box they were originally suppsoe to give me anyway. (HELP) As of today I have been overchargd approximately 70.00 each month for the past 4 months
__label__1 I have received several call saying I was delinquent with a payment and my services would be shut off. I actually went to my bank and collected proof that the payment in question was actually paid in full. I took this print out to my local Longmont store and showed to a customer service rep. who proceeded to tell me that it was a fake, and that she would remove that charges or the late fees. I now get 5-8 calls per day threatening me and have had to deal with rude Comcast reps on the phone with no end in sight as to a resolution to this problem. Any contacts with them are not noted on my account but I keep records of dates and times.
__label__1 Oh my comments are completely fair and accurate. I can be accurate to tell you that I was promised for $99.99 HBO Starz Cinemax 105 extreme Internet and unlimited voice. DVR box was supposed to be 50 a month with the middle box which is the second box being free and the 2 smaller boxes. Help you watch your analog TV for 398 for both of them. I mean they already have a monopoly over you not being able to have any sort of local channels because they cut in a log out and you have to page to be able to watch any sort of TV anyway and that was supposed to be for 12 months. Because of all the stuff that I was going through I've been hung up on, talk down to, lie to, my account has been messed with while I wasn't on the phone. While I was on the phone one lady told me from sales that oh well she can transfer me to Solutions but she's not sure if they can do anything but we can try. Leave me on the phone for 20 minutes and then comes back on the line and says solutions can do nothing for you. I'm like "I did not ask you to transfer me and keep me, you know, and talk for me. We were supposed to ask to speak to cancellation and she puts me on hold again on her whole day, after I asked you not to put me on a hard hold." And he gets on the line talking about "well I'm just letting you know that I'm not going to be, I'm not going to be, you know, like something about me recording the line" and he's not going to say something that he doesn't mean. And I'm like "dude I don't care what you're saying. All I'm telling you is that my stuff is supposed to be for 12 months." And he's like "well I'm just telling you for at least 6 months." I'm like "I know it's on for 12 months and not 6 months." 12 months is been a hassle since the beginning of February 2014. I paid my bill August 6. August 7th after I transfer my bill my service was shut off. I had already paid for my month in advance as you need to pay for them ever since August 8th when it was finally turned back on. I'm sitting here arguing with people from all the way to August 11th. You have no idea the frustration. And then this is what it's going to be. I am seriously done and honestly all we have to do is boycott these people. That is it. Believe me they will get their ** together. We are the only ones keeping them going, we're the only ones keeping them in business, we are the only people on the face of the planet that can keep any business going. A business cannot strive with out its customers so don't let them treat you as if they're doing you some sort of freaking favor with this. "I'm giving you 200 worth of service ma'am for $125." No dude. "I'm paying 125 a month of service so you can pay your rent." So do not let them act like they're doing you such this great service. Pennies on the dollar it cost to run these things on the dollar. And they're trying to make it act like you have to understand millions of people with cable and anywhere from 59, 69, to over 200, you have to understand the billions of these people are making billions. Anyways that's just a little bit of frustration but every one of my phone calls were recorded. Record all your calls, put it to your account that all your calls will be recorded on any account, FPL Comcast bill, cell Sprint Verizon, just any company that you call any business that you do record your business. Because when you have a record of the business that you conduct no one can say "well we can't be responsible for with the last person says because we don't know what the last person has said you but I can do what I can do for you." No, because you have a recording of what the last person said so. You can do what that person said, your codes and antics in this and that. They're freaking full of it. They can put in there your town anyway they want, anyway they want. That's it because I'm tired and done. So that's my screwed up Comcast deal, but Comcast isn't the only company control. You make the dollar what it's worth, we make the dollar what it is worth and without us the dollar is worth nothing. Gold, diamonds, anything plastic held a piece of **, and green could be worth a million dollars if we wish it too.
__label__0    I called Comcast on Aug 21, 2009 and was told that all I had to pay to get my digital turned back on was $171.38. I asked if that inlcuded the surcharge and was told no, when I called back a week later I was told I had to pay over $350.00 to have my sevice turned back on plus a $5.00 surcharge. I paid the bill and htought I would not have to deal with them again until my next bill was due. I got my next bill about a month after I payed the full amount and it was for $350.00 dollars and if I didn't pay by Oct. 17th I would be shut off, then on Oct. 11th they shut off my digital cable and phone service. I received a bill today from them the second since they turned off my phone and digital cable and they are still charging me for digital cable and phone service. I want to know how this is possible how can I be charged for a product I am not even using, and if I call and ask them they never give me a answer but tell me I must pay for it. The total bill is $698.00 dollars and over $350.00 of that is for services I don't have since I didn't pay for 2 months at one time.I received a bill today from them the second since they turned off my phone and digital cable and they are still charging me for digital cable and phone service.

__label__0 I have filled out a complaint via the BBB.  The  BBB ticket has been open 12 days without any corrective action from Comcast. The issue is the web space management at the Comcast Company. I have had over 40 calls in regarding this single issue. Several phone  calls have been over 2 hours in length. Nothing is being done about  this issue. Every time I open a help desk ticket (by calling in); the tickets are  closed without the issue being resolved. I have called every single day  for 2 weeks in an attempt to get this remedied. I have been told that I  am well overdue for a refund, but it is the Comcast company policy  that nothing is to be refunded/credited until the issue is resolved.  It has been over a year, and I have yet to get a refund/credit for the  web space issue. This issue still needs to be taken care of.  I feel the company is not keeping their promise as stated in their  terms and conditions. I have never gotten to talk to a Tier 3 technical support. Each time  the ticket is entered, and elevated to the tier 3 tech support, the  ticket is closed without being worked. I called again today (30July08) to  see the status of the latest trouble ticket. Much to my horror, I was  told it was resolved. In reality, the issue has not been resolve, it has  not been worked, it has not been fixed..  I am seeking resolution to the problem, as well as a refund/credit for  the money I have spent for this service I have yet to receive.   Settlement Sought:  Refund/Credit for the money/time spent without  service. Service made available as per the Comcast company service  agreements to customrs.Money has been wasted on a product/service that has yet to be properly provided. money has been spent on this product/service for over a year.Currently, i do not see a rebate in the process. Damage: money spent on a product/service that has not been properly provided.
__label__5 Comcast had triple play for about 8 years. Never got a bill over 140 monthly plus tax. Was happy with everything until early this year (2015) when bill triple because Comcast put a cap on WiFi without customer knowing. I have to let my cable go. Can't afford it anymore. Very unsatisfied customer now. When Comcast take the cap off WiFi, will return again.
__label__1 As a Comcast customer for internet service, which I have no complaints to date, I decided to change from DirecTV to Xfinity cable. They had an attractive bundle pricing that included cable and decided to take advantage although I had a bad experience years back with their cable service. Installation day however resurfaced past bad experiences. Although my house is pre-wired, my choice was to move their internet wireless modem to one end of the house - the signal is weak as well as expose wires throughout the rooms. Otherwise they would have to run additional wires in the attic at an additional $100 per line to change the current modem wiring they had installed. In the end the installation cost far outweighed the savings from the bundle. Finally when I asked the technician to remove the outside wire he had installed, he left over 20 U nails all over my yard.
__label__1 This time last year, I called Comcast to see how I could reduce my monthly bill. I was told about a 2-year contract they offered and it would guarantee my price for 2 years if I agreed to the contract. Now that my first year is up, they have increased my 2-year discount from $24.96 to $40.95. I even asked "Jeffery" (the customer service agent) if he would agree to a 2-year contract if the rate weren't guaranteed. His remark was, "Now that I think about, no I wouldn't!" So I asked, "Why would I?" Comcast lied and trapped me into having to honor the 2 years with another year left or get stuck with a penalty. And they don't have to honor the price! Isn't that called switch and bait? Don't believe any deals, unless it's in writing from this company. So a year of a few extra dollars is worth losing a longtime customer at the end of this next year. I'm so mad. I may even pay the penalty. It sickens me to pay this bill!
__label__1 So about 6 months ago last summer a door to door salesman for Comcast basically trapped me outside while doing the yard work and convinced me to switch from DirecTV to Comcast just to try it out. He stated that Comcast no longer has any contracts that they use with new service. He also stated that I would get a $250 (of which I only got $100 gift card) and I only had to stay with the company for 3 months to be able to get the gift card. After the three-month period I was supposed to be able to cancel with no extra cost. However I tried Comcast for about 6 months. I went to try and cancel my Comcast today as I wanted to go back to DirecTV because the service I was getting was horrible. When I cancelled I was then told there was going to be $150 cancellation fee for my contract. I informed the lady on the phone that I did not have a contract, however she stated I approved a contract and there was no way to override it. I argued with her and with her supervisor for about an hour. The supervisor stated that if I would have contacted them after I received the email stating that my services were turned on and at the very bottom I guess it said that it was on a term contract. However because I was told by the agent of Comcast that there was no more contracts I didn't read any further to see if I was in a contract. So now what I'm trying to do is first he told me to go to the store and return my equipment and see if they would help me get my hundred and $150 removed from my account. Or if that didn't work I am supposed to send a snail mail letter to Comcast. Unbelievably Comcast corporate offices do not have phone numbers or email addresses that consumers can contact them with. We are to send a snail mail letter and hope someone calls us back. It's not about the money to me. What I'm upset about is I was lied to and this isn't right. And I wonder how many other people he lied to to get them to sign up for Comcast. And how many of these people don't know yet that they're under a two-year contract that they have no idea they're under. I did tell him that I wanted someone to check into the person who did this to me and that I wanted the company I guess a third party company to contact me and tell me if this is integrity issue. Which I'm guessing it is because it happened to me. It had to happen to someone else from the same guy. I will be going to the store front hopefully next week and I will update you on what happens. I am just so annoyed that an agent of a company can lie to you and not get in trouble for it. The supervisor said I should have read the entire contract before I signed it. I'm sure there are people that do this but most of us trust the person who is signing us up for a service and feel I'm sure that if they lie the company will fix it. And the service by the way was horrendous. I had probably 20 if not more disruptions in service in the six months that I had it than I did in the 15 years that I had DirecTV before that. Also Comcast charges for most of its on demand products. They either say you can rent them or purchase them. Whereas DirecTV has mostly free on demand. You have to pay for some of their movies but most of their TV shows are free. I'm hoping that this will help at least one person not get Comcast. If you want a good company go to DirecTV. Comcast is horrible and I don't know why I even tried it for the three months let alone 6 months that I did. I figure they were a big company and they would be able to fix the problems. Yet they sent out technicians and the problems did not get fixed and now I find out they lied to me. So I will be coming back after I go talk to someone in the store and let you know if I got anything resolved or if I had to write that snail mail letter and then see if someone calls me back. So basically do not under any circumstances sign up for Comcast unless you have a lawyer. Read your contract ahead of time. Or you'll get screwed.
__label__1 About three weeks ago one of our tvs went out. Comcast was very quick to schedule a service visit which was awesome. However after a two hour visit, heavy furniture moved, cords disconnected, and no problem solved I was a little shocked and disappointed in the service. Right after the service man came and solved nothing, two more tvs went out due to lost connection. (Maybe the multiple cords he pulled apart and left?) So I just got off the phone with customer service for the 2nd time. First time I was told to order a new box at my cost. I did. Problem still exists. This time I was clear. "I want another service visit by a different person bc now 3 tvs have lost signal." After an hour on the phone with this woman my tv is still broke, she wouldn't let me schedule a service visit, and then she ended the call and hung up. Great job Comcast. We'll be canceling in the next few days.
__label__0 I signed a two year agreement and was to receive a $300 gift check within 6-8 weeks.  I've mad numerous phone calls to unhelpful and rude service reps who told me to stop calling because I was not going to receive my check.  The original service rep who placed my order did it incorrectly and although my record shows I'm eligible, I have not received my promotional offer. I wonder how many other comsumers were scammed. I would never have signed the agreement and to terminate would cost additional money in loss.  I was counting on the gift card for gas and possibly to pay my comcast bill.
__label__0 I recently moved into my apartment at the above mentioned address and the local Comcast installer came out to hook up my computer, cable and two televisions. Everything was working fine when he was done. However, since that day (I had not actually moved into the apartment until this past weekend, but when I had tried to turn the living room television on, I could not get it turned on), I cannot get the television to come on. There is power and the bedroom television works fine but not so with the living room television. I have been on hold for ridiculous amounts of time with Comcast, never being able to reach a human being. I have left messages with my Comcast "salesperson" Greg ***, who, when he was trying to sell me the "triple play," could not do enough for me. Now I cannot even get him to call me back. I want this problem rectified immediately and moreover I want my cable bill adjusted accordingly to reflect that I have been completely without one of my televisions for at least 2 weeks since the installer did the initial work. 
__label__1 Triple play for 99 is an estimate only. After they add in all their hidden cost my bill is 184 a month. Also a data limit of 300gigs is ridiculous - that's a binge Netflix session. Always freezing up and the customer service is unreliable to say the least. Was told I'd be moved to unlimited data free of charge and 2 months later a charge of 55 was on my account raising my bill to 240 a month. I recorded all conversations and stored them just for this reason. I contacted customer service 3 times to be clear no extra charge for unlimited data would apply to my bill but did the fact I had 4 of their employees on record saying no charge would be applied, no it did not. Of course all this happened after my 30 days in which I could cancel and go with another company so I'm stuck for a year with an outrageous bill and the worst internet available. I suggest you really do your research and ask over and over what your bill will be after all the fees they continue to pack on after you sign. Not pleased and I will cancel asap.
__label__1 I just sat on the phone for 36 mins. waiting to speak to customer service about my bill. In the last two days I've called them probably six times only to be told their servers are down, call back tomorrow. Every time I call, it's another 36 min. call. My bill is never what they quoted me, it's always around $200 range. Now they are unwilling to make payment arrangements with the less fortunate trying to get by. My husband has been out of work for 18 months with a bad back surgery and we are barely making ends meet. You would think a company this huge and greedy would work with us to make more money. I make a payment one week, and the next week they turn off the service! Not even a courtesy call to give us a heads up or give us a chance to scrape the money together to pay it. More than 50% of the time our cable doesn't even work on one of the TV's. NEVER would I recommend this company to anyone. If I had a choice, I would be on U-verse! But Comcast has the monopoly in my area. But I am definitely researching other options. Then Comcast can kiss me goodbye!!!
__label__1 Last Wednesday, while home recuperating from a severe arm injury, the buzzer on my apartment rang. The person who buzzed wouldn't identify himself. Nevertheless, I buzzed him in. Turns out he was the Comcast repairman. I advised him I didn't have Comcast service, and never had. After a brief argument, he took my word that I hadn't requested service, and departed. After about 2 hours or so, he buzzed me, and came up again. After a rather vociferous argument, he finally believed my statement that I NEVER had Comcast, and wouldn't have it even if they paid me to take it, and he left. He couldn't resist buzzing my apartment for a few times after he left, however. I guess he wanted to aggravate me, as he could plainly see that I was in pain from getting up and answering the door. Where does Comcast hire these employees? How could they screw up customer addresses so badly?
__label__0 I was given an $80 price of Triple Play HD for one year at Best Buy and was told that it would be the same at Comcast in Memphis. It ended up twice the amount on the first bill. I have a few days left in the $30 money back thing and will cancel unless I get prices in writing. There is something badly wrong with fraud in the Comcast company. Someone needs to file for class action suit against Comcast, and very soon to teach them a business lesson on fraud against the American public.
__label__1 I have a packaged subscription with Comcast for cable, computer and telephone services since January 2015. What I'm having problem is their cable service. Every time I go to their on-demand feature to select movies, the screen freezes up for ten minutes or so and keeps you from moving forward or backwards or scrolling downwards or upwards. They show you title of movies by a gallery type of line-up which is over 1,000 entries and before you reach the bottom of the line-up, the screen freezes up and you start from the beginning again (and I've been stuck sometimes for 8 tries before I finally reach the end of the gallery). I've called them about 15 times to correct the problem but they still are unable to fix it.
__label__0    This all started about a year and a half ago with outside cables being left above ground until someone tripped. They were negligent until i called the corporate office and then it was corrected and I was compensated. Then I had trouble with a TV burning out from having their cable box connected. I got no where with that. Then my  home phones stopped working and it took several visits only to tell me I should by the cordless with one reciever. Next, my so called promotion ran out and my bill went up $100. Currently, my DVR box stopped working and I was told to return it. After a few days I finally made it there and the new box would not work for three days when someone was on the way to fix it. Customer service has been horrible and their advice has sucked ( sorry for the language). Currently they have some much better promotions and I am told I can not switch over. They also have been billing me for an extra DVR box for a while now and i have to wait five days for an answer. To me this is absolutly unacceptable and I have o choice but to switch over services.Next, my so called promotion ran out and my bill went up $100.

__label__0 I have been a Comcast customer for many years. I never have been a satisfied customer, just one who gave up complaining once the level of service was at least tolerable. Anyway, my latest issue with Comcast is one that I believe all Comcast customers should be aware of and complain to the Better Business Bureau, local news stations, or state attorney general's office about. Since the much talked about nationwide digital conversion took place, Comcast has decided to do an internal digital conversion. They are migrating channels in an effort to save bandwidth, and this migration means that all customers who are currently receiving signal to a TV without any type of box will have to install a digital box or DTA (digital adapter) in order to continue to receive the channels they currently pay Comcast for. Comcast says this will not cost the customer any more, and in support of that, is saying they will provide (for free) up to (2) DTAs. Any additional will cost you $1.99/month. I don't know about you but I have a whole lot more than three TV's (Comcast is offering a total of 1 digital box, and 2 DTAs), so that means if I want to keep my same level of service on all my TV's, I need to spend more per month. This means more electrical equipment plugged into outlets in my house, costing me more per year to run (admittedly, not that much). It also means having to hide stupid little boxes on all my TV's (try hiding these things around small flat screens), as well as having to deal with yet another remote for every TV. But the best part is that once you install these little suckers, you can kiss your ability to use VCR's and DVR's good-bye. Why? Well, think about it, these recorders need to be hooked directly to all cable channels so they can tune the selected ones in at the selected times for your recordings. The problem is the boxes only output one channel at a time. So unless you only record on one channel, you're screwed. But, that's okay, Comcast is more than happy to sell you a DVR subscription.Personally, I feel Comcast is guilty of pulling a bait and switch on their newer customers, and just plain screwing the rest. I mean, didn't I see ads from Comcast touting how their customers had nothing to fear from the digital conversion? Don't you think they got a whole lot of new customers from the fear-mongering ads? Do you think that any of those new customers were told that virtually within weeks or months of their signing on-board with Comcast, that they would be facing an internal digital conversion that would force them to take on more equipment and/or pay higher monthly charges? I doubt it. I'm sick and tired of being pushed into an ever smaller corner with respect to my television entertainment options, and feel it's time for us all to push back. Write anyone you can think of about this. Don't stand for it.
__label__1 My complaint call started on Jan 8 due to internet service so slow (3-9 versus 50mbps) during the holiday weeks. They took 4 days to fix the problem; however, on Monday Jan 13 the problem is back. In the meantime, they refused to give the BLAST expensive service credit for the month of December and now spilling into Jan.
__label__1 Comcast tells you one thing on the phone and then sends you something that's about double in cost from your conversation. Comcast calls you two or three weeks before your payment is due and say you owe it to be current and you have two weeks or more. Comcast is down probably 10 percent of the time from my experience and when they come to your house and make your services worse not better and then they charge you whatever they want. They were the most horrible company I deal with and that goes back for years. When you question them about the charges, they can't explain them. They just cut off your services slowly and so you are intimidated and afraid so you end up paying early and too much almost all of the time. I went down to their service center and it was full of people that were complaining, yelling, being loud, doing everything. Everyone down there, they were really upset with this company. I'm at their services, policies and their overcharges... I canceled the TV services and I'm shopping the rest of the coverage is to get away from them once and for all time!!!!!
__label__1 In September, Comcast sent an Equipment Change Required letter to me. Essentially, it said that I had to swap out my converter box, no mention of cost or if I had the option of not swapping. I got my bill and Comcast socked me for an extra $15. Comcast, that's not how you treat smart consumers! That was very underhanded! It was not a big amount, but you do not lie or deceive customer. I am pissed.
__label__1 Don't fall for the commercials saying "Xfinity is faster than AT&T." It's all a lie. I have AT&T at a different house and I have no problems whatsoever, and I'm in a complete AT&T dead zone. I can't even watch a video on YouTube straight through without having it 1) buffer many times and 2) be terrible blurry quality with Xfinity. I'm supposed to have speeds at 25 MBPS but when I did a speed test, I was getting 76 KBPS. I can't watch movies On Demand either. If you have Xfinity, I would switch to AT&T immediately because you are getting ripped off majorly. If anyone is considering switching to Xfinity, DON'T!
__label__0 I recently moved to an area with Comcast cable turned on. Everything went right as planned till after a month after I moved in. I got a bill that said I owed about 450.00 dollars from 8 years ago. I have never had Comcast and have lived at my last address for 11 years. When I called, they said that there was nothing I could do that it was my bill when they finally told me about the bill it was not even in my name!Just SS number so they told me that if I took in proof of where I lived and my state ID they would get it off my account. Now let me tell you this was 3 months ago and now my cable is off and I'm still being charged a monthly bill! So I called everyday and get the same answer that they will have to have someone else call me back and let me tell you I call 3 times a week and still have not heard anything! So what am I supposed to do? I have lost cable TV and still being charged for it and it's on my credit, even though I have gave them everything they asked and showed them that this account was not even in my name. How can they charge me for it?
__label__0 
__label__5 I am fairly certain that Comcast (Xfinity) went to the new format to make it harder for you to go anywhere other than within the Xfinity System. Not sure why but their TV Listings and ability to program from there were very workable. They did away with all of the TV schedule filters and various time elements. IT SUCKS BIG TIME! I have been a customer for about 30 years. I think everyone who has been with them for any period of time knows that new subscribers will always get a better deal. Customer loyalty is worth zero to them! I am anxiously awaiting full service Google cable!!!
__label__1 We switch from Verizon to Comcast on Mother's Day last year. Comcast contacted us to see if we were interested in changing providers. We agreed on a monthly price and equipment. Four months later, our bill was increased due to audit and they increased our monthly fee. They claimed we obtain an additional pc. of equipment unbeknownst to them and shut the device off from their end. When I inquired they turned it back on and then the billing nightmare began. Every month I call and try to speak to a floor manager. When I finally was able to speak with **, he provide me with a ref # and assured me a return call within a week. In addition, he also stated that he understood my problem and that the Comcast should honor my contract. Next month, no changes to my account & the bill began to grow. I have asked several time for them to pull my original phone recorded statements to listen to the statement of their representative telling us for a certain amount each month and for the equipment they installed, our monthly fee will not be increased for 1 year unless we order a movie in addition to package. We understood and agreed. Now I am being told they need to charge for the additional pc. of equipment and they had a rate change. I have dates and times in which our conversations occurred. But I am told, they cannot go back to listen due to volume of calls they receive (I am sorry to hear that, but every conversation starts off with a recorded message stated "this call is recorded for training purposes"). Every month I called I tried to give the CSR the ref #, but it appears they have no meaning. Hopefully they can resolve this issue and honor what they originally promise. I feel this is a simple request. Thanks for listening!

__label__5 What happened is I reported to Comcast phone helpline on 6/20/2012 that my cable and internet service was suddenly unavailable at my address four days after I paid my account balance to zero until the next billing cycle starts, 7/07. The technicians ultimately appeared 8/22 for the fourth scheduled appointment inside my home (tech appointment **). They first failed to appear as scheduled on 6/27. After the technicians performed 8/22 per schedule, they stated to me that it is impossible I receive cable and internet at my address until their recommendation to install a new underground line is executed. The Online Escalations Team informed me on 8/28 via e-mail that a technician will visit my place in 10-15 business days; evidence of the 9/4 visit yesterday is disturbed earth, new cable outside my home and restored internet and cable service within. The consequential continuous days of no internet or cable service availability at my address, my numerous reports to that effect with various Comcast personnel via phone plus hours of Comcast chat online, were inadequately recognized. Indeed the helpline personnel were actually combative on 8/21 and insisted technician records indicate service was restored previous to the first Escalations Department ticket prepared on 8/17. Because it is my direct experience that Comcast suspended effective customer service to me until 8/22 for a problem that likely could be solved before the 7/07/12 billing cycle, I have not experienced fulfillment of the Comcast guarantee. Comcast chat this date 9/5 of two hours resulted in the analyst preparing a ticket number for the Management Team to address the continued billing for internet and cable TV services when these services were neither provided me nor available until 9/4; which constitutes a service interruption of 76 continuous days. I give Comcast every opportunity to keep me as a loyal customer, pending their planned response the online analyst states is forthcoming within three days from today.
__label__0 I disconnected Comcast May 2nd 2011.  I was told by a Comcast rep to return the equipments to the nearest Comcast office within the week.  So that was exactly what I did on May 3rd & got a receipt of returned equipments.  The receipt also showed the account had 2 cents credit.  I even verified with the rep at that office that I didn't owe anything.   Then later on, I received phone calls from Comcast asking for their equipments. I told them that I have proof that their equipments were returned.  They basically said not to worry.  Then I received a bill in early June charging me for unreturned equipments.  I called & spoke to yet another Comcast rep.  I was so upset.  The lady looked up my account & I was on hold a long time while she researched.  She came back at the end & told me not to worry b/c the system showed that I don't owe anything.  I asked for a confirmation email, but she said there wasn't a way for her to do that.  Then today July 7th, I got another bill same as in June!  I call Comcast again. I asked for a supervisor.  After being on hold 15 minutes the rep came back on to tell me he can't find a supervisor.  Then he connected me to Nadia.  Again I explained my situation.  She said I still owe Comcast for the modem.  I explained that I  didn't have modem owned by Comcast;  I had an old modem that was offered for free six years ago via Comcast promotion w/ Bestbuy.  When that modem died, I purchased another modem.  All with my own money.  At first rep Nadia didn't want to hear, but eventually listened.  So finally she said she would have the matter researched & removed the charge for now.  Comcast have lost me for life, & I will spread the word. 
__label__0 ALERT!  You are NOT protected with your alarm system's monitoring if you have Comcast Digital Voice and the DV goes down.  Comcast DOES NOT tell you this when selling the DV.  In addition, your safety is compromised if someone (thief or worse) cuts your cable line.  Your alarm will ring but your monitoring system WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED that there is a problem.  Comcast will tell you if the power or cable TV goes out, your phone switches to a battery modem for phone service, thus your alarm monitoring is not interrupted.  But they don't tell you if someone cuts the cable line to your home you are NOW at the mercy of the buglar or WORSE.  This information should be given PRIOR to installing digital voice for the customer to make a decision.  This is a lawsuit waiting to happen
__label__1 Three times in the last few weeks the internet has gone down. Guess what Comcast? I work from home and NEED internet access to do my job. Having such outages is bad enough, but when you pay for the highest speed... that is what you should receive. NOT a happy customer at all, and I'm quite sure my boss won't be too thrilled either. So sick of your ads that state you have stellar service. It's all trash and you guys know it. I'll be calling in a bit to make you aware of my plight.
__label__1 Comcast double charged me this month and without permission from my husband and I, charged us. Now our account says that the amount of money is credited to our account. It was their mistake. Why is it not back in our BANK account? Anyone having this issue? They have no right to charge us twice (different dates). We did NOT set up automatic payments either.
__label__0 My dad and I live together and have been subscribing to Comcast for roughly 2 years now. Originally, our service was just fine. No problems. Now, it is the exact opposite. I believe it started in January when the internet would cut out every morning at 2 am. It did this every single morning. I called Comcast to let them know of the trouble and that it was an issue for us, since we would use the internet at that time of the day. The customer support representative said that it was a very simple issue. She said Comcast was sending updates to the router and modem and for whatever reason, the updates weren't making it from the modem to the router. Her suggestion was to simply reset the modem and router every time the Internet cut out. That suggestion seemed a bit non-caring and ridiculous. I shouldn't have to power cycle my equipment every time I want to connect to the internet. Then the disconnections started happening more frequently, especially during the nighttime hours. Every time the Internet would disconnect, the phone service would shut off too. I called Comcast again and complained that we can't use services we are paying for. I told the customer service representative that I was calling from a payphone, since their phone service was too unreliable to carry on a conversation. And all calls would cut out after a minute or two.The representative confirmed that it wasn't a problem with our router, since the phone service doesn't even go through it. The representative also said they would send a technician out to check the modem and the cable line. Then the technician replaced all the line from the pole to the house, replaced some splitters, and replaced our modem. She also found a problem we didn't know we were having. When she connected her device up to our cable line, she said we weren't getting all the TV channels that we were supposed to be getting. We hadn't noticed this, since we don't watch that much TV. After she replaced the equipment, she did another test with her device saying she noticed a drastic improvement but admitted that the signal was still not in proper specs. Since the internet appeared to be working at that moment, she left saying to call Comcast if we had any further issues. Sure enough, the problem came back immediately. The next tech Comcast sent out checked everything, replaced some cable lines inside the house, and left. Nothing he did fixed the problem. Then one of our many TV boxes quit working altogether and wouldn't pick up any stations. Comcast sent a tech to replace that and to try to check on our internet problem. The technician replaced the TV box and got the TV signal working again but wasn't able to do anything for the internet.I called Comcast to complain again. At this point, they offered me 6 months of Showtime for free. That was meaningless to us, since we hardly watch TV and it in no way helps the internet problem. A discount on our bill would have been more appreciated. At this point, Comcast told me they would send out a field tech, since the regular techs couldn't solve the problem, and that he would definitely be able to solve it. The field tech came out and seemed to understand exactly what the problem was but not what was causing it. He decided to rewire the inside yet again. When doing so, he felt voltage running through the line. I felt the lines and sure enough, it was comparable to a strong 9V battery. He immediately said he was done there and that we were causing the problem ourselves. He said our house wasn't properly grounded and that we were feeding voltage back into the system thus causing our own problem. How he was so sure of this, I don't know, since he did not use any devices or equipment to confirm this. We were charged $40 for that tech to come out. After his visit, we had all the outlets properly grounded and tested the ground to make sure it was a good ground and worked properly. It did. Since our internet problems had been progressively getting worse, I called Comcast again. And again, they sent out a technician. This tech appeared to have the best understanding of the problem. After giving him a history of the problem and what had been done thus far, he watched the modem lights and confirmed we had a real and serious problem. He said he would go outside and test the line to see whether or not we ourselves were sending voltage and noise back into the system. That is a test that the field tech should have done but didn't.After he finished his test, he confirmed that our house was not causing any noise and there wasn't any voltage feeding back in the line. He then told us that the problem was being caused by one of our neighbors. He said that one of their houses was creating high voltage and feeding noise into the system. He apologized for the fact that he wouldn't be able to fix it right away and said to give him 2 or 3 days to isolate which house was causing the problem. He gave us a cell number and said to call him directly if we were still having problems after that. Two days later, the problem appeared to be fixed. A couple more days later, the problem came back fully. We called the number several times and left a message but never got any call backs. That was not surprising. I called Comcast, and they said they knew nothing of it and that according to their map, our neighborhood was just fine. This was in contradiction to what the representatives had told me in earlier phone calls. On more than one of my previous calls to them, the customer support representative had checked their area map and said "yes" that they can see that there are some service issues in the neighborhood area.So basically depending on who you talk to, they will either admit or deny a neighborhood-wide problem. Eventually the last representative I spoke to apologized and said there was nothing that Comcast could do at all. She did not offer any sort of compensation or any discount on our monthly bill, even though she admitted we weren't getting proper service. I explained that I was thinking of switching to Qwest for internet service, and the representative told me that that would not help. She told me that Qwest uses the same lines and poles and that even if I switched over to them, we would continue to have this same problem. At that point, I decided to wait just a little longer before cancelling services. As of now, we have cancelled our TV and phone service but still subscribe to internet. Our problem still exists. I don't know what to do. Also, in the past week, aside from the random disconnects, our speed has dropped significantly. We are paying for the 20 Mbps service, and as of a few weeks ago, we were getting that with an average of 23 Mbps. Now, the best we can get is 3 Mbps. The slowest speed Comcast offers on their website is 15 Mbps. So something is clearly wrong.I don't know what to do anymore, and I get the distinct impression that Comcast is taking advantage of us and doesn't care as long as we keep paying the bill. Is there no law that requires them to keep their end of the agreement? We can't afford to pay $40 every time we need a tech out here, which is always.
__label__1 I work for a manufactured home developer and was asked to contact Comcast to have an existing underground cable line lowered just several inches to allow for installation of a drainage line. Every day for six working days in a row I was promised someone would be there to look at the problem but no show, and no call. One day I was told someone would be there by 6 pm. I waited in the rain. No show no call. I was transferred, hung up on, told I need to stop talking and answer their questions first before I could speak with a supervisor, transferred to India or Pakistan and told to be patient by someone twelve thousand miles away. I have to say that I swear on my children's heads and everything holy that the truth is, in my younger days I have gotten better customer service from my drug dealer.
__label__1 Had Comcast out Fri. They rewired the line outside. Monday the line falls down over my driveway, laying on roof garage, and laying across 3-4 lines coming into, and out of my house. I call Comcast, they say they won't be able to come fix it until Thurs. This could be a fire hazard, and I told customer service this. Said they would call me tomorrow to discuss this. Well it's tomorrow, and I still haven't heard a word from Comcast.
__label__1 This company is appalling. The representatives lie to customers everyday about billing and services they will receive then charge them something completely different on their next billing cycle (evidence below). If that isn't bad enough, they go a step further and berate their OWN customers. My experience: my fiance and myself sign up for double play, two-year contract, and terminate early. We were moving out of our apartment and in with my family, who already has Xfinity, in order to prepare for some future purchases. Upon talking to a representative I am quoted $84.19 for terminating. No problem, except my bill comes in shortly after at 129.01. We call the billing department to see what the issue is and we are met with hostility and resistance. We are then put on hold and shortly later another rep from billing answers and I have to explain what is going on again with the bill. They are generally rude and when I ask for their name, they REFUSE to give it to me. The conversation ends with her saying quote, "the bill is the bill and [she] was tired of people trying to to cancel service and not pay their bills." I was HUNG UP ON. I can state right now, I have paid and would be happy to post every paid statement for their lackluster trash called "service". This is how Xfinity handles themselves and it pains me to think I went with them just because most of my family and fiance's family has them. After this experience I will never have anything positive to say and will encourage both families to switch to another service, along with anyone that will listen. I can tolerate the lies, and the shoddy equipment, but I will not be disrespected for asking a question. Do yourself a favor and go with any other service or beat your head with a brick when you get bored. Both are better options than Xfinity.
__label__1 Xfinity's app for the home security is just plain horrible! The time it takes to view cameras is too long! There is a 7 second delay, so one can actually walk in door without being seen! Comcast promotes this home security and yet I have had nothing but issues, constantly need to be reset. If by chance the alarm is set off, NO ONE from Xfinity calls to see if everything's ok! This is the worst home security system and the worst app! I DO NOT recommend!
__label__1 Let me first say that I left Comcast 3 years ago because their customer service was so poor. But, with internet and satellite from two different providers, the allure of faster internet and lower cost (locked in for 2 years) was quite alluring. They also had a 30 day guarantee which made this seem too good not to try. I went to the local Xfinity store to set up an installation. At the time, I made it clear to the sales person that I would not be porting my phone number off of AT&T until I was sure that all other services were working well. They said this was no problem and I was set for installation on the next Sunday.On the Friday the installation, I came home to three messages on my answering machine. The first from an automated system saying there was a problem with the install and I needed to call ASAP. The second from a frantic sounding CSR saying I needed to call Comcast immediately and the third from an automated system telling me that the install was cancelled. All three calls came in within a 3 hour window.In the evening, I called their toll-free number. It should be noted that I was unceremoniously disconnected at three different points during a 2-hour ordeal through Comcast hell. When no one could tell me why the install was disconnected, I asked to be transferred to the disconnection department. I found someone competent who was able to explain that they could not install the service without a phone number and what they would have to do was assign a temporary number and then perform the porting of the home phone later. They spent another 45 minutes on the phone with me to setup an emergency installation for Sunday afternoon and we said our good-byes.Sunday afternoon came and went and no one came. I called at the end of the Window only to be told that they had no installation scheduled. I let this sit for a week as I was going on vacation and resumed my attempt to trial the service in the new year (2015) [now, against my wife's better judgement]. However, now that I *knew* what the installation personnel needed to do, it certainly helped me tell them how to get it right. And I did get it installed. So what that I had an orange cable draped across my lawn.The internet was an order of magnitude better than AT&T, but the video was poor. I found that the video was leading the audio by 50-100ms, enough to cause a bit of brain confusion and more than enough to cause disorientation in my daughter who reads lips to help her hearing deficit. Figuring that there was some QC which must have known, I waited a week but things still did not improve.Another hour on the phone and two CSRs later, I finally got connected to Tier-2/Headend support and I explained that there is no way to compensate for audio lab and the issue is in the transcoder. The Tier-2 CSR (Les) was fairly knowledgeable and found another similar ticket was logged a week and a half earlier and he linked them. We talked a few times in the following 3 days and I told them to read a recorded show off the box as an example of the lip-sync issue. A few days later, still no ETA, but they recognized there was a problem.Time to hang it up. About 3 weeks into my 30 day trial, I went to the Xfinity store where the odyssey started and asked if they could review the bill/extend the trial due to their issues (by now there were half a dozen tickets on my account). The sales person was very curt, saying essentially that I had only two options, pay full price or disconnect and that was it. No supervisor or anything. So, disconnect it was.Two days later, I brought in all the DVR boxes and cable modem and was shocked to see all the equipment thrown away (cables, power supplies, even the $3/month video box -- ok, that was a mistake but just an example of the continued carelessness). The attendant had never handled a disconnection within the 30 days, but after a supervisor came by, all was supposed to be done. However, they have no accounting responsibility so a ticket had to be created to close the account and zero the balance. This happened on 1/23/15. Five days later, I get a bill for $400+!!So, another call to CSR hell and I talked to someone and gave them the ticket number. I got some story that there were delays in the system (5 days?!) and that the account was now zeroed out. I thought that was it, until 2/5 -- when I get another bill. I noticed that Comcast is not affiliated with the BBB (what a shock). If Comcast should want to fix this, my email is **.
__label__0 I am writing about my disappointment in the DTA migration decision.  I have been a dedicated customer for over 20 years.  I was originally under the impression that this would be a good thing, as I own a digital-capable HD television.  Comcast stated that it is an upgrade.  We are experiencing not the high quality picture that you advertised.  Since not all stations are HD, all others are fuzzy because of the pixels, as well with hesitations.  How is this improving your network?With our original basic plan, we were receiving stations such as 14/23/26/29/33/50-57.  You are advertising that there are extra channels.  However, it removed about the same amount of broadcast channels.  The new library of stations is nonsense and absurd.  It seems that Comcast is trying to extort their customers by upgrading for additional stations we were already getting.  This is unacceptable and brings me to go to Verizon or another satellite provider, especially through times of hardships for persons who are unemployed (myself).  And my father also has the basic and only collects social security and his housebound.  The additional costs for the promotions, even though you do not think it may be a large cost, is a substantial difference for others. You quote, We want our customers to be amazed with the choice Comcast offers.  Well please, let me know what that is when you have it.  You are not holding up your end of the bargain of the Comcast customer guarantee, as your promise.  We are not receiving the superior customer experience from Comcast.  I know you wish to maintain a good reputation for Comcast.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.
__label__1 I am writing to describe a terrible experience I had with Comcast today. I moved into this apartment about six months ago and have been trying to get working cable ever since. I reached out to Comcast, who, for at least the first 2 months was not able to locate the address (apartment UPPER was in their system, not Apartment B). Despite the people downstairs and the apartment to my right having Comcast cable, I was told that there was no address in the system. Turns out, several calls and multiple customer service reps later, there was an address for my unit, but it said apartment upper, not apartment B. Comcast was unable to fix this in the system but agreed to set up service. I had service connected, paid a deposit, and went to pick up my own boxes and router for install. I had trouble with install from day 1.Finally got the internet set up (after having to have a tech come out to install after all), then when I bought a tv and connected the cable box (about 60 days later), turns out the cable didn't work. I couldn't get my tv/cable box past the Welcome... connecting... screen. I scheduled one appointment. The window of time was between 2-6. I missed the guy though no fault of his own, so rescheduled. Rescheduled and was told the tech didn't need access to my unit, only to come home to a door tag that says, "Sorry we missed you." Scheduled service again with a tech between 4-6 pm, left work early, only to get home at 4:03 pm to find a door tag time stamped at 4:00 pm that said, "Sorry we missed you!?!"I called Comcast to tell them I'd just walked through the door... it took THIRTY-FIVE minutes on hold, a hang up, call back, and two transfers for someone to come to the phone and tell me that the tech was no longer available and that I'd need to reschedule for a Saturday appointment. Of course the tech isn't available any longer... or even in the area probably! I've been trying to get through this - "please press 1, please say your address, please let us know if you'll take a brief survey after your call" automated system for almost an hour! At 10 til 5 pm I don't expect him to still be down the street. I did, however, expect a phone call when he arrived EARLY, and by 4 pm (the very start of the window) had already written and left a door tag.I tried expressing my frustrations to the person on the phone and he just sat in silence. I rambled on about how I felt giving someone a WINDOW of time, only to show up early, then leave before the window STARTED was poor customer service, but he sat silent. I asked if he was even listening to me and his response was, "I am." Monotone, zero concern for what I was going through... just more silence. I told him to please pass on my frustration, but I have no doubt that the guy really didn't care, hung up the phone with me, and moved on to the next caller. That's what prompted me to look online for a place to provide feedback.I wish I could make this review public and that there was an alternative to Comcast because service has been HORRIBLE since day 1, but this is the first site that showed when I did a Google search for Comcast Reviews, so here I am. I hope that someday this company can take all of these lengthy ONE STAR reviews and bad experiences and turn them around. I can't believe an organization this big doesn't care enough about it's paying customers to invest a LITTLE extra time and effort to make them happy. Geez.
__label__1 About 2 years ago, I had service from Comcast. Out of 5 scheduled service appointments (guaranteed to be on time or $20 credit!) they gave me the credit 5 times. My favorite one was when I called to find out why they no-showed me I was told that they had shown, I didn't answer their call to confirm when they were on the way. I asked what number had they called? I had my cell with me all the time while I waited. She read the number and it was my Comcast internet phone number, so I asked her to read me the reason for service call and thought her voice amusing as she read "internet phone not working."Fast forward year later, (last year) and I sign up for service again. Told them I wanted same service as before - basic cable and internet (had downgraded to this last time due to poor service). Was told 89.99 was best they could do. Thought price must have gone up, not abnormal for poorly run, horrible cable companies. I go pick up equipment, pay initial deposit and return home. Set up equipment. Internet works, no TV, screen says "channel not authorized." After spending 2 hours being handed around and no TV still, they schedule service call and tell me I am lucky they have an appointment in 5 days available! Service tech shows early (awesome), looks at my screen and says "filter on your line from previous tenant" (I had moved since previous service). He goes downstairs and in seconds TV comes alive. He comes back, leaves receipt saying no charge for visit and bounces.I go to check my first bill and it is 331.00!!!! My plan, with taxes, was 127.00, they charged me 70 bucks for service call and another month. I finally, after 2 weeks, got them to remove service call fee, paid for one month and then asked them to give me basic package as I did not order it (I was 3 days over the 30 day guarantee). So they told me I would have to make bill current before they could change plan (wtf?) that they had erroneously given me. I had paid for first month because I had the service, but didn't pay second because I hadn't used it yet! They also had not changed the start of service date to my actual one as I had no TV for first week, that's why I had passed the 30 day mark. I explained I was on fixed income and second payment would not be possible for 30 days. They basically said "Oh well." Made next payment, called again, was told bill could be lowered to $54..... as soon as I caught it up. Tried managers, online chat, and I have never talked to such rude, mean people in my life..... that were supposed to be customer service agents!!! I thought I was in the twilight zone. So, I cancel service and return equipment. Told there was wait time for receipt. So, 2 weeks later, I get bill for 320 bucks for the equipment.... took me another 2 weeks to get that straightened out. I HATE COMCAST. I MEAN THAT. I REALLY HATE THIS COMPANY. DID I REMEMBER TO SAY THAT I HATE COMCAST?
__label__0 The television freezes up. Internet service does not work, on demand does not work correctly. Service technicians have been here several times in the past eight months, but problem returns hours after they leave. When I go to use on demand it does not work, and if it does it will not work for 2 hours straight. comcast has done nothing but increased my bill to $190.00 per month and then they critize me cause its working when they arrive. when i call about it they make me go thru the same procedure of resetting the box etc. that takes about an hour, but no results.
__label__1 My problems started many months ago. It started with my inability to log onto on-demand shows, tech starts by removing the amp(which was installed by another tech) saying I was getting too much signal. This led to my internet going down with amazing regularity BUT on demand worked a little more often. I finally had to plug amp back in to get my internet to work, I would sometimes have to unplug it to get on demand to work. Having lost patience with spending hours and hours on phone to sort this out, I just put up with the bad service for a couple of months till my wife came home from overseas and insisted we do something about the service we were paying so much for.Now my internet has gotten so bad that it goes down 10+ times a day, this takes the phone service out as well and usually on demand. A week ago, a tech comes out, checks all my equipment, and says the problem is outside the house and that he will report it and give it a week and if it was not fixed, call for another appt. To be fair, it did get a tiny bit better, only went down 8+ times a day. O.K., so I made another appt. for today 5/7/14 and it was for 1-3 P.M. They call me around 11:15 to see if they could come early, I told them noon would be just fine and they said they were on their way. Here is where it gets interesting, at 2:30 I get a call asking if anyone were home and that the tech had come and gone. They called again after I told them they were wrong and my wife was home. The last time they called they said nobody was home. I called home and talked to my wife who was at home with 2 dogs (about 200 pounds all told) who do not let anybody walk past the house without very loudly letting us know. On top of that, the garage and front door were both wide open as my wife was going in and out doing front yard work. When I called to complain and tell them that the only answer was their tech was lying, she said she would note this on the account and she promises to get us a tech 1st thing in the morning and after explaining we would not be home the next day, she insisted she would get a tech there. After repeating myself several more time, I asked for a supervisor named Manda, who said only his 1st name was necessary when I asked for his whole name. He then asked me again what my original problem was and said, "Oh, we will send this to the internet/phone techs" and they would call me so I wouldn't have to wait on the line. Still waiting. When I asked for credit on my bill for missed appt., he told me I would have to call (and no doubt wait) the billing dept. I (probably stupidly) have been with Comcast for over 15 years and it seems the bigger, more advanced they get, the worse the service gets.
__label__1 Robotic in their responses, reading a script and they seem more interested in you having a positive review of them. Granted when tested it get high speed results but the quality is poor proofed by all the interruptions streaming and stalling when surfing the web, it frequently stalls or can't open a page. Poor value if everything ran without stalling and we could watch a movie without interruption and we didn't have such poor performance from phones that rely on our internet feed I might be happy paying over a hundred dollars a month for the internet and what few channels we are allowed for the tier we are at. Reliability is nonexistent. I know of no one that is satisfied with Comcast/Xfinity service but business. We live in the heart of Silicon Valley and we can't get a better more reliable service, why is that? The rich neighborhoods do not seem to have these problems. This just stalled again for about 20 seconds and again just then, pathetic.
__label__1 I have Comcast only because in my area there is only the choice of the "two evil giants", AT&T and Comcast which results in a stranglehold, illegal trust-like (monopoly) grip on consumers. Everything was working as well as could be expected (for Comcast) up until 2AM last Friday when my Internet suddenly went dead. My computer was receiving the router and modem just fine, all lights on as normal, but I could not open any web pages. Just an error message page from Xfinity.I called and I was told that my modem was "end-of-life" (Motorola Surfboard SB 6121, DOCSIS 2.0) and was no longer being supported, so it was REMOVED FROM MY ACCOUNT! THEY CUT ME OFF! I only bought it ONE YEAR ago. Hell, my cell phone is SEVEN years old and still works fine! I was told my options would be to rent a newer one from them or go buy a new one. UNACCEPTABLE for Comcast to dictate to me how I spend my money. Mind you, I am still paying for my Internet service, which I am not getting. A new modem costs $125. To rent from Comcast is $10/month. So If I buy one, it won't pay for itself for 12.5 months. By then, are they going to cut me off again and force me to buy yet another newer modem???First they told me they could not put the modem ID numbers back in my account by phone, that I had to drive across town to a Comcast store with my own modem and have it done there. After my threats of leaving Comcast for AT&T, they agreed to put my modem ID numbers back in my account and tried unsuccessfully to get a signal to the modem.After many aggravating hours over four days (I'm talking like full-time job hours!) I managed to get on the phone with a reasonable Level III Technician who told me he agreed that it should be up to the consumer when to replace their own equipment, especially if it was still working. He got the ID number replaced again, but still wasn't able to get it connected. Finally, I was scheduled to wait two days for 2 service techs to come out to the house to investigate my lines. But my lines were all BRAND NEW from the utility pole all the way to the modem, as I had replaced the roof on my house three weeks earlier and all the lines had to be cut and replaced (by Comcast).SO... AND HERE'S WHAT YOU ALL SHOULD DO. I filed a complaint with my State Attorney General Consumer Protection Division AND the same with the FCC!! I said it was fraudulent business practices to cut off paying customers from services in order to coerce them into renting or buying new equipment at Comcast's discretion. In addition, that since there are only two providers in my area, it is still not unlike an illegal trust situation. Apparently, the FCC agrees that I have a case. They immediately forwarded my complaint to Comcast.Within hours, I had the "Indian call center" contact me to offer me a credit to my account and to attempt to restore my service at once. It so happened that the service techs showed up just at the same time. They found filters were installed on my lines and removed them, then they found that the ID number the phone techs put in was one digit wrong!!! I only repeated the correct numbers about 8 times! End of story, they got everything running. Speed test shows I'm getting 57 mbps while I'm paying for 75 mbps, but all you "techies" know that's to be expected. I may go out and buy the SB 6190 (DOCSIS 3.0) when I can afford the $125 - BUT THAT'S UP TO ME!
__label__1 I wanted to get internet service from Comcast cable services. I checked myself the availability of the Comcast service at my address and got the answer online that the service is available. So the next day, I called on the number 877-417-0922. My call was, after some time, answered by a person who called himself Kenneth. After taking all my information, he told me that I will get internet service at $29.99 and a free router and modem. Then he said, "you will pay for the two said devices and you will get the paid amount back as a rebate". After this, he said "you will have to pay for the shipment $19.99". Then he said, "you will not get the shipment amount back". The total amount he made was $199.93. He took all my credit card information. There was not enough amount in my bank so I offered him another card and told him to get the total amount from the two cards. He told me that I will pay double shipment if I have to use two cards for payment. I did not want that so I rushed and deposited some cash in the bank to make the payment from one card. After making the payment, he started offering me more of his offers from AT&T security and tried to connect me to the AT&T security people. I told him that I have been on the phone for about two hours and I was late for my job, I will do that tomorrow. So then he connected me to the installation department to setup the date for installation. The man who talked to me from the installation department called himself Steve, told me that my computer shows that Comcast service is not available at my address. After too much discussion, he told me that I should cancel my order from the sales department. So I called back to the sales department and found on the phone a person called William. William told me that the installation department people may be confused and that we have the service in that area and connected me back to installation department. This time, I found another person called Espo. Espo said there is no service at my address. I tried to reach Kenneth, the first person whom I had talked and who had taken all my credit card information to cancel the deal, but I could not get to him. When I reached for my job, I was two hours late. At my job, my cell phone started ringing. I had told Kenneth that I am unable to pick any call when at my job. I tried to call back, but nobody picked my call. The next day, I got a message from my cell phone company that I have used all my minutes and I need to refill my account. The next day, I called the number 877-405-5035 and talked to a lady whose name was either Rem or Allisan. She told me that I still can get the rebate. She told me to fill the forms online and send it for rebate. The form for rebate was asking for the date of installation, but I haven't been given the date of installation by the Comcast people because they are not going to install the service to me. There is much more to say because I have talked to some other people in Comcast. Please do not do this. Please be truthful.
__label__1 I've even with Comcast for 42 years & always paid my bills on time. Presently, I'm under contract with Comcast for the Xfinity bundle, until May 21. In January, my bill went up $49. I've called several depts. trying clarifying this increase & lower my bill. They said it was for equipment & nothing could be done to help me. Finally, this week, I've decided to TOTALLY drop Comcast, but Comcast Cancellation Dept. told me I couldn't cancel them until the actual contract termination date, even when asked to do that on May 21! I use to be able to negotiate with them, but not now! I'm so frustrated HAVING to do business with a company that NEVER hears or values an existing customer. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!
__label__0 I recently had to view my bill online. I transferred my services from another physical property address last year. When I logged in to view my bill, I saw last years bill that showed the account paid in full. When I contact customer support, the employee should have taken care of switching my email address to the new account. Since they did not, I was reassigned another email which I have no knowledge of and do not have access to.Not to mention, that now not only do I have the inconvenience of not being able to access my email, I also cannot change my email address on other sites if I have forgotten the password because they will send it to the Comcast account that I can't access. I have stayed with this company due to the inconvenience of having to transfer my email address. Well, I might as well switch companies now that I have to set up all new account with every company I do business with online. It is extremely frustrating that I cannot access bills, accounts and emails. Lengthy amount of time trying to find and transfer email address when you no longer have access to the email account that you have used for years due to the fact that Comcast lost my address in cyberspace and cannot correct the issue. I think everyone should switch companies because Comcast personnel are not knowledgeable about their services or helpful to consumers.
__label__0 I had Comcast cable/phone/internet installed on July 13, 2009 and I am ready to cancel them. Every afternoon the service goes out and my phone is dead. What is going on? I am out of work. However, I do typing and depend on a working internet provider. Comcast just tells me it will be up shortly (after I use my cell phone minutes). I need a dependable service. Comcast sure wants their dependable $182 monthly charge!
__label__0 Been a longtime subscriber so I figured I'd at least get ok service.  Boy was I wrong.I have Comcast digital cable/HD.  I bought a Tivo so I needed to have them come out and install a cablecard so that I could access the HD channels.  They gave me a 2 hour window for the tech. to show up (3-5pm).  No one showed so I called Comcast, they said that the wrong type of tech. was dispatched and that they would definitly have the right kind there before 7p. No one showed so I called again.  They said that the tech was running late and would be there by 7:30p.  No one showed up so I called again.  They said that there was no record of a tech being dispatched to my address.  I told them that wasn't acceptable since i'd been waiting since before 3p.  They offered to re-schedule the appt.  I asked to talk to a supervisor.  After 10 more minutes on hold, I got a supervisor.  He told me that no one shown up because it was so late.  I told him that that was a different story than the previous person told me.  I asked why he would lie to me like that.  He couldn't give me a good answer.  After a heated discussion, the supervisor finally agreed to credit me $60 plus a pro-ration of my service charges (approx. 1 week of lost service) and schedule a new appt. about a week later.  So I ended up getting paid about minimum wage to sit around and wait for them to hopefully show up.  Nice customer service?lost 5 hours of work @ $165/hour.  got $60 +1 weeks pro-rated.lost 5 hours of work @ $165/hour.  got $60 +1 weeks pro-rated.
__label__1 Worst services ever. There's always a power outage. Bill is unpredictable for same services. They can't help you when you need it the most. Big mistake.
__label__1 I've been a customer of Comcast cable T.V. since before it was Comcast (Memphis Cable Vision, 1979). On May 31st, 2014 I ordered Internet and phone service from Comcast in addition to my cable T.V. The order came with a 30 day money back guarantee if not 100% satisfied. First, The technician who came to my home on 5-31-14 appeared to weigh in excess of 300 lbs. He was here for three hours and sat in my office chair for most of this time. I did note that he was leaning back in the chair and towards the desk. The next morning I sat down in the chair and it immediately collapsed to my right, towards the desk. The steel framed box at the top of the hydraulic lift under the seat was mangled. The chair wheels are flat on the floor and the seat is bent all the way over almost touching the floor. I rode the seat all the way from "upright" to its present position, hanging on with my grip on the arms and hitting my head on the desk and my right shoulder on the floor. I did not seek medical attention as I was O.K. I immediately called Comcast and complained. They gave me a reference #** and told me they would follow through and let me know. Numerous calls to customer service have resulted in empty promises, apologies, being placed on hold for long periods. switching my calls to the main number I dialed at the beginning, forcing me to start all over again with the main menu to identify myself and finally OUTRIGHT Disconnects. If Consumer Affairs would like, we could do a three-way call to Comcast customer service because this frustrating tactic is far too frequent to be accidental or unintentional. This is so often the norm, that it must be a common and acceptable practice. Now Comcast says I have 5 digital cable boxes. I have four. I have 3 T.V.'s. A number of years ago Comcast gave out the tiny converter boxes with NO monthly charge. This was when the U.S. went from analog to digital. They gave me two. I tried to return one a few years back and was advised to keep it as it was FREE and I may end up needing it in the future. I agreed and put one away. Now they said they have done an audit in June 2014 and that I had Five boxes total: two DVR boxes, the two smaller boxes and a regular HD box. (I have 3 TVs.) They could not tell me when I was supposed to have acquired the HD box. And now they are charging me for it ($9.99/month). I don't have this box, I have only the 4 boxes of which I will return one.And lastly, promises to "Port" my old number over to my new Comcast telephone dragged on each time telling me it will take four more days. This never happened. I had had enough. I called Comcast to request that they discontinue my internet and phone service and that it was within the 30 day guarantee. They said if they came out they would charge me a trip charge of $39.99. So much for the guarantee. I said don't bother. I was very glad I never disconnected my internet and telephone service with AT&T. AT&T came out for free and reconnected my AT&T Router/Modem and I plugged my telephone back into the proper wall jack. I am disabled and spend a lot of time at home. I need the cable TV and am afraid what they may pull next. The chair cost $240.00 and I really liked it. I had to replace it and bought a cheaper one from Office Depot, but there's a big difference in comfort. I feel that Comcast owes me the cost of the chair and a call from someone with the power to be able to correct the errors on my account. Thank You.
__label__1 I have been doing tests for two months on my internet speed that Xfinity says is 50mb. It has NEVER been over 40mb.
__label__1 We have 2 accounts with Comcast because we have 2 homes. I have a credit balance on account #2 (Margate) of approx. $300.00. The money has been sitting there for a couple of months. Our bill is very low on account #2 because we are not using the house in Margate now. I have called Comcast twice and they refuse to either send me a check or transfer the credit from account #2 to account #1. They said that since account #1 is in my husbands name and account #2 is in my name, that cannot transfer the credit. We are both authorized users on both accounts. Comcast will only allow one person's name on the account or we would put both names on the accounts.The problem occurred when I did my online bill pay. I selected the wrong Comcast bill. So, I have all this money sitting in the Margate account, and they refuse to give it to us. It's unbelievable! I actually called twice about this issue. The first person that I spoke to said that they could not do. However, the second person said that she would take care of it but never did.
__label__1 I am a long time Comcast customer; I use their services for phone, internet and TV for both my home and business. In October, I moved my household and got Comcast service at my new home. Since I own both homes, I had service at both residences for a period of time. During one of the many visits to my new home to get my new service hooked up properly, I turned in my cable boxes from my old home to their (contractor) representative. I asked if I needed a receipt and was told that I did not.A few weeks later, people started showing up at my doorstep to collect the equipment. Then phone calls started. Then threatening letters and finally collection notices. I have called multiple times and even stood in line at the local Comcast office, explaining all along the way that I turned the equipment in to the Comcast representative that Comcast sent to my house. I opened a ticket with my visit to the office during the holidays and was told that I would be contacted by January 13th. I was not. I called on the 14th and spoke to the finance group, leaving my cell number and being assured that I would be contacted. I never was. Finally, I have received a collection notice telling me that my very high credit score is now being impacted. Last straw, I am now fighting back after being harassed, ignored and finally injured by Comcast over your internal mistakes.
__label__1 Signed up for 2 services at 2 different locations. One signed up for the $39.99 that included their performance internet of 25Mb and digital converter with Showtime and Streampix for 12 months. At my other location, I signed up for the $49.99 plan with the Plus Blast internet of 75Mb and digital converter with HBO and Streampix. During the online sign up, decided to take another digital converter as it showed $0.00 charge for an additional converter. The next morning I received 2 emails for each sign up, one price was increased from $39.99 to $44.99. The 2nd one, there was an additional charge of $9.95/month for the 2nd digital converter and $10/month for the speed increase (speed that they're offering, there was no increase).This company is a greedy vulture. Even online, when you have screenshots of your orders, they try to screw you. Well, good thing is that I have options for service providers and it was a no brainer to call them immediately and cancel the service orders. You'd think they'd actually try and do business honestly, even when they know people have options. This is exactly why I canceled them last year. Take one service, get a bill for something else. Their customer service is clearly taught to lie to people just like their online services are set up to mislead.
__label__1 In June 2014 I contacted Comcast regarding new service. The salesperson said I would get a $450 Visa gift card after 3 months of continuous service if we signed up for XFinity Triple Play. We said to go ahead, service was installed July 2014. After NOT receiving any confirmation nor paperwork regarding the gift card, I called Comcast to verify. After numerous run-arounds I was told that I would get the gift card by the end of Nov. 2014. After our 3 months of continuous service, I called again & got the run-around again. Nobody seemed to know anything about a $450 gift card! Now I am told by their sales dept. that I never completed the contract because they never finished it & that's why there's no record of the promotion on my acct. Now they are saying I can't get the gift card because of that! They dropped the ball & I lose out! This is the worst provider! I don't see how they can stay in business!
__label__1 In our town of 9500 people Monmouth IL we have Comcast as 1 of our providers. Comcast is leasing the equipment from the old company that they got the broadcast license from years ago. Here we are not required to have a cable box. We don't have Xfinity or internet through Comcast. The problem we have been having is that every couple of weeks we have no sound on channels and this has been going on for years here. Every time I've called Comcast claims I need a cable. I've told them you going to tell everyone in town they need a cable box so we can get sound because the problem is all over town. The issue is with the old equipment in our town. Comcast will do nothing. The technician goes up and does whatever he does, flips a switch or whatever and wow we have sound. But every time customer service wants to send someone to my house I tell them "Go ahead. I would like to talk to the technician that is screwing things up." They say "Ok we will send someone." Well they never do and wow the problem is solved for a week or 2. In talking to Comcast customer service they are from another country and are dumber than a box of rocks and can't possibly understand the issue in our town. You can ask for a supervisor in the U.S. and sometimes that will get you somewhere. I have made about 17 calls about this and each call averaging an hour. Comcast does not care about it customers and some of the support people you call they don't care about your problems. Comcast is the worst company to deal with. They can't provide a service. Can't bill you right. They add things to your bill. Dish Network is looking more pleasing and getting more channels. Sounds awesome
__label__1 At Comcast suggestion I purchased a new modem several months ago. But I am being billed a lease charge for my own modem. Customer Service said that the charge will be removed and corrected. I am still being charged for the lease every month.
__label__0 Comcast ran advertisements saying if you bundle your internet, phone and cable services you will save money. I was quoted a price of $150.00 by Comcat. I was paying 67.00 to ATT and 107.00 to Comcast. Instaed of my cost going down my cost are greater because Comcast is charging me 70.00 for digital voice that I did not ask for and installation fees for digital voice. The issues were answered by J. Taylor by justifying the fees and not adjusting or addressing the unwarranted fees. Also, I aclled to cancell before I made the switch and Comcast convinced me not to cancel  by promising to provide additional receivers at no cost because the satelitte company had quted me a prive the same as Comcast with 6 receivers. If Comcast has done this to me I am sure they have done this to others.
__label__1 I have not been able to watch this video because the advertisements interrupted and then the video would not come back! Awful service! Hire competent people! Evidently you have low pay, incompetent people working for you! Thank goodness there is Netflix and I do not pay for your service (condominium account). I would never buy it!
__label__1 We signed up 2/27/15 under the 30-day money back guarantee. Canceled 3/4/15 because the recordings & on demand were not what they told us they would be. We were not allowed to have confirmation of this cancellation. Reps kept telling us it could come via email after some action or another........ didn't come. We were told some other action would generate the email confirmation....... didn't come. We got a letter saying the confirmation couldn't be sent by email. That letter was not a confirmation. They we owe $78; it is overdue. Now they are saying our equipment wasn't returned. We were told to take it to USPS. Before we did that, they called to say they could pick it up. We have that receipt with a 2-letter illegible signature & serial numbers that don't match the email that the equipment wasn't returned (so you might want to check everything on every document Comcast has you sign). I requested a supervisor 3/13/15; they won't transfer to supervisors. I was told one would call in 48 hours. Never happened. Nothing on our online account indicates we canceled services 3/4/15.
__label__0 Every month I get a bill with no due date. It will say billed from 4/23-5/23 but do due date. When I call comcast, I get several different responses. Sometimes, I get the 3rd of the month, or other times, I get the 14th of the month. Which one is it? Well, aside from that due to me only getting paid once a month, my bill to them is always past due. So then I am stuck with a $7.00 late charge fee. It use to be $5.00. I don't know when they changed it to $7.00, because I was never notified in any of the billing statements. I have never know anyone to charge for your payment being late, especially not that much. $7.00 is alot of money, for being a couple of days past due...do they not realize that things do come up, and sometimes, like with me only getting paid once a month, I usually miss my due date. They are always raising the prices for their crappy service. Thank God, I only use their internet! I would NEVER use them for anything else. With everything being so high from groceries to gas, it is ridiculous to charge $7.00 just because your payment is late. Is there anything legal we as a people can do to stop these money hungry giants? This should be considered stealing money from those that support comcast through having their services. It's just ridiculous.
__label__1 Mr. President of the United States, or anyone please investigate Comcast and their bogus charges every month. Every consumer is being ripped off by Comcast. I am being charged for singular service when I have 3 accounts with them under the same name, but they are charging me as a single user. Now they are charging me a deposit after having service for five years plus and they want to charge for each box at every location every month. With taxes on all these charges, it adds up to a significant amount to a depressed economy already. Please help. Should we buy food or pay Comcast extra money for nothing?
__label__1 A year ago I was attracted by their promise to bill $59 a month for internet and TV, but skeptical. Never got to experience that agreement. If you are late in prepaying your monthly installment they will call you up to 7 times in one day. Evidently forgetting your demands to no longer call you. Never seen anything like it.
__label__1 Are you kidding me? I didn't receive a bill after the install and called the company 3 weeks after to check on billing. All I got was the automated system with an ungodly amount due. I suspect my bill is for 3 months and a late fee. When I tried to talk with an agent the automated system informed me that a 5.99 charge would be added to my account. No way I am paying to ask about my bill. This is a despicable business practice. I'm going down to the office in person and chew on a real agent. They are going to wish the company didn't charge to ask questions over the phone. What a ripoff. If you have any alternative to using Comcast, do it, this is this worst company ever.
__label__1 I have a business in Shreveport, LA. Used to have another internet carrier, but switched to Comcast BUSINESS, because rates much cheaper. Here's our current status: for 10 days, our internet is OUT at our BUSINESS. We have done everything to contact Comcast, and it is literally unbelievable that a business customer has been unable to let them know we're out of service. It's their modem that gave up. It died. So, because the area is now out of service, they don't know we're out. We have called repeatedly to Business Comcast, and it just sits on hold for half an hour. We have an online acct, but there is literally NO OPTION on the website to let them know VIA EMAIL that our service is out. WE WILL DEFINITELY BE CHANGING BACK TO ANOTHER CARRIER. If any one gets this by Sept 8, please have Comcast contact us and restore service. Thanks.
__label__1 In August 2015 I went to an Xfinity (Comcast) store and asked that our home phone line with AT&T get bundled in with our existing internet and cable TV service with Comcast. I was told this would be a seamless task - NOT SO!! Our phone service has been disconnected 2X by AT&T but they continue to bill us monthly. Comcast is also billing us for the home line. They've overcharged us. Said we'd get credits applied to our bill but still haven't. Each company is pointing the finger of blame to the other company. We've dealt face to face with representatives of each company who are polite, understanding but extremely ineffective. We're about to have our Comcast service interrupted due to an unpaid balance. My husband is 74 and I'm nearing 67. This has been such a struggle for us and is very upsetting. We do not know how to get resolution on this with both companies. Please advise. Thank you.
__label__1 I shopped online for Internet providers at my new home. I found a deal from Comcast, and called to sign up for it. I took notes because I've had problems with Comcast before. The deal was for 12MB (download speed), $30 a month for the first 6 months, $45 for the next 6 months, and $60 a month after that. There was no contract, so I could quit any time.After two weeks of intermittent service, I was billed $60 per month. This is even though my bill said I was receiving 12MB download speed. I found out I was only getting 6 MB download speed. I was pressured to pay the bill for the incorrect amount. Amanda at Comcast said she could not generate a new bill for me. She told me that I would receive 12MB download speed now, but I sincerely doubt it since no one was assigned to come to our house to make it suddenly work faster from then on.
__label__5 About 3 weeks ago I switched my basic internet service with Comcast to a Bundle since it was actually cheaper at the time. $59.99 for Performance Internet (50Mbps)/HBO/Basic Cable for 12 months. I confirmed multiple times over the phone with the agent and thought everything was good. Today I called in to check on my current balance since the online system does not update for several weeks (apparently once a billing cycle). I was shocked when my balance was over a $100. The agent told me she did not know of any such package at the price point I was promised, but my account did show full pricing for the internet, some "HD Tech" add-on I didn't ask for, and the cable. So they were able to pile on all the services but not successfully bill me the right amount. Go figure. Fortunately, I called in and after some difficulty was able to get most of the charges removed (we will see, I have been promised things from Comcast before). I switched back to my prior internet-only service with them. Why doesn't Comcast email a receipt for the service change? Are they afraid that something in print could be damaging to their image? They keep everything secret on their end - you have to call in constantly to make sure things are being handled properly, otherwise things just magically slip up. It's an antiquated system from an antiquated company. I just hope the near-future will offer some alternatives for ISPs (Comcast has a monopoly in my area).
__label__1 Have business account with Comcast and I always check on my expiration day. They always say on the end of this year 12/31/2015. When I tried to close my account they said "oh your account will be end up on 03/30/2016." I told them "What do you mean? We agree on one year, not more than one year." They said "oh you change it." I am like why should I change it while I am not using the service and add 3 months, that doesn't make no sense and they yell at me and they saying they won't close it. If I don't stay with them and pay they will destroy my credit. Is that how you guys keep the customer? That's ripoff and I won't let you abusing me or forcing me.
__label__1 For over three months now, the townhouse community, City View, we have had outages, scrambled tv shows, access to on-demand scrambled. iDVR programs and the screen gets scrambled. All the neighbors have the same issues.
__label__1 Comcast cable goes out all the time, 4 times in October. Small storms seem to knock Comcast offline and this is cable service. Today is Saturday and I was just told that the cable service for this entire area will be out until Monday. Plus the customer service is terrible because it takes at least 20-25 minutes of waiting to get through. On Monday, I will be canceling my Comcast service because it is truly awful here in S. Florida.
__label__0 Why do I need a television with a tuner in it anymore? Comcast is changing to a "gotta have our little box to receive anything above channel 30 now." I can understand a satellite receiver needing a special receiver for systems like Dish Network and DirecTV, you know going into the contract with those providers that you're not going to get the same kind of product, and as far as I know, they haven't changed their service since implementation, but Comcast? Why the heck did I spend $210 on a new digital tuner (purchased through Best Buy with no mention that it would become obsolete in 12 months)? Why the heck am I required to use a special piece of hardware to suddenly support Comcast's signal? I'm more than a little miffed that the digital tuner I bought last year is now worthless scrap. For that matter, what the heck is wrong with the digital tuner that came with the television I bought last year? Why do any televisions in the northwest need tuners at all if there is basically no service provider sending a signal that is compliant with a standard or HD television signal?At one time, there were standards. Standards that meant you could plug something into something else and you knew it would work because it was built to a standard. Standards were meant to protect the industry, the consumer, and in a small way, the government that embraced that standard and endorsed it. The 110 volt wall outlet is a beautiful example. I can pretty much be guaranteed that if I plug a three prong electrical cord into it, I'm going to be able to power a 110 volt device. Today though, even if I've got what looks like a cable for TV, I can no longer be guaranteed that what's there is going to be interpreted as a standard signal my television can consume. I'm very disappointed with the mishmash of products that were allowed to be sold in the US if they were going to become scrap within a year or two. Someone should have indicated the digital tuner program we were saddled with was a pure bunch of bunk. The only thing I can see is that it took the cover off the top of Pandora's box and now all television service providers can do anything they want.
__label__1 Comcast, you are robbing customers that made you to stay in business. Most horrified customer service experience. I hope you burn in Hell! It's shame shame shame. I am switching to RCN.
__label__1 I set up a payment arrangement to have an EFT on my checking account on September 5, 2014. I went to local office on September 4, 2014 and paid bill in cash. Called Comcast to stop EFT, was told it was a legal binding contract and that they could not stop it, that I would have to stop payment through my bank - so I did and spent 31.00 dollars to do so. They of course tried to send it through and of course it was kicked back. So imagine my surprise when a paper check hits my bank from Comcast for this arrangement. And because they deposited a paper check into their account they were able to bypass the stop payment. I don't even use checks... Everything I do is with cash or debit card. So bank has opened a fraud investigation on Comcast.
__label__0 I signed up for the $99 promo back in Feb 2007.  Again, never saw a $99 bill.  It was always $149.  Now, the $173 has thrown me over the edge.  One last thing, FOUR MONTHS Comcast debited my checking account TWICE for the same payment.  We can't issue a refund, you'll see the credit on your bill.  Is Bernie Ebbers running this company from prison?
__label__1 On October 3rd 2016 I notified Comcast I would be moving states but keeping and installing the same equipment I already had. I gave them my disconnect date of 10/14 and my start date for my new address on 10/15. On 10/15 my old account was charged my regular bill. It is now 11/4/2016 and I have spent more hours than a full time job trying to get a refund. Every time you call you are transferred to out of the country call center who is very limited on what they can do. When you ask for a supervisor there are always none available. Finally I was able to speak to a billing specialist in the U.S. and she refunded the money back to my old account instead of putting a credit on my new account. What good is a credit on the account that is no longer in service. I will probably never see my refund. MANY hours on the phone over $60 dollars! And I still have NO refund.
__label__1 Had my internet service mysteriously stop working a week ago while listening to Pandora. Think Comcast gives two craps about correcting problem as promised to a customer of many years- think again! I knew something was up many months ago when my internet kept going out & losing its IP address or default gateway constantly plus having modems replaced twice in barely a year. And I was always told it was "interference in my own home" & not any fault of theirs. Oh & also recently supposedly some interference in MY house was creating interference with "other neighbors' service" that required them to come in my house- but at last minute they decided wasn't necessary without further comment- maybe cause I made it clear I didn't wish to upgrade like they wanted. It's all in the news now and all part of a game of greed on their part to use your home internet signals that YOU pay dearly for monthly to fuel their big project of "providing alleged secure wifi hotspots" that have been shown by experts to not be totally secure & unhackable. Glad I moved on to use another carrier & not wait for it to hit the fan & have my computer hacked. Comcast got too high & mighty for their pants & it will come back to bite them in the end & I will be laughing (with working service & much better customer service) when karma comes around!
__label__1 Worst ISP available. Intermittent signals with the absolute worst telephone service I have personally ever experienced. When I say intermittent signal, my internet will randomly go out. The best part is, however, I can yell into the "security camera" aimed inside my house to turn the signal back on, and it works! Big brother? Is that you?
__label__0    This is minor compared with the horror stories I've been reading, still ...Last month I lost service  for 4-5 days when a comcast technician erroneously disconnected my cable by accident in the process of installing cable for one of my neighbors.  It didn't take me that long to figure out I didn't have cable, but I wasn't able to get a technician for 4 days.Then on my next bill, I get a charge of $27.99.  They charged me to fix THEIR mistake.  Sheesh.I complained to a very polite customer service person, who was very apologetic but unable to help me.  She kept referring me to their little insurance policy where you pay a monthly fee so you don't have to pay when the technician comes by.  Yeah, that's nice, but I shouldn't have to pay for THEIR screwup.Then on my next bill, I get a charge of $27.99.  They charged me to fix THEIR mistake.

__label__1 I used their app and it showed no outage. I had app schedule a call back. Re-authenticated and told me they were working on it but it wasn't an outage?? No ETA? And tried to sell me business class (which shares same lines and offers no better reliability) and actually accused me of violating my agreement by trying to VPN into office??? Comcast service is down weekly in our area sometime for minutes but not unusual for it to last 30 mins or more and sometimes hours (as in the case this morning). Why does the FTC and government allow companies in the marketplace to create monopolies like cable companies? I pay 50% more for internet service in FL than in NC!!!
__label__5 Very nasty customer service reps. Clear channels. Nothing wrong with service just billing. Very expensive. You get overbilled. Not for anyone on a fixed income. Pretty reliable. Could be better. Comcast does not consider that some of their customers are seniors on a fixed income and do not get paid when their bill is due. They should take this into consideration and change the billing date to accommodate the pay schedule of the customer.
__label__5 I called to tell them that I was moving and needed my services turned off after July 1. They shut off my phone and internet a week early. I needed them still. I had movers coming and a U-box delivery late. All my information was in my emails. When I called to get it turned back on, they first told me that it would take a week to get someone out to me. After 1 hour on the phone, it was fixed. Now, I have been waiting for a $118 refund since July 2011. Every time I call, they say they are sending a new check that never comes! If I don't give them their money, they cancel my services and report to my credit, but what happens to them if they don't give me my money? They should pay me interest! 
__label__1 I got a brand new DVR box. While watching TV, the sound continually "skipped". I had technician after technician try to "fix" the issue. They couldn't (big surprise). I got a manager over here to try to find the issue. I was told that it was solved. Two minutes after he leaves, I experience the same problem. Comcast products are clearly NOT meant to work well. This gives them an excuse to jack up the price for their "upgraded" products that are even worse than their predecessors.
__label__0 I recently moved apartments in the same complex, approximately 2 buildings down from where I currently live.  I called Comcast to transfer service, and things were going fine until I was hit the the transfer fees.  Now I know where these guys make the money.  First I was being charged $25.99 for the reconnect fee.  Then I was asked how many TV's I had.  After I told them 2, I was then hit with a $13.99 charge to activate the second jack in the apartment.  Let's sum this up: $25.99 - Reconnect Fee; $13.99 - Additional TV Fee; $18.00 - Monthly Bill. To get setup this month with their service, it's going to cost me close to $58.  Every other company I worked with to transfer my services offered it free of charge.  I don't know how Comcast can actually get away with this, but I don't plan on being with them much longer.
__label__1 Recently I decided to remove some of the services I had with Comcast. Last month, I received a bill in the amount of $169 for the previous month's cable, modem and internet services. Part of that bill was not only for June 28th-July 28th, but for the coming month of August. As I always pay each month for the services I have used for the previous month and never for services not used yet, I felt that by removing the rental fee for the modem they provide and the cable services and keeping only the internet, I would see it reflected in this month's bill received today, August 28th. Instead, I discovered that Comcast not only charged me for cable and modem rental for July 28th to August 28th, along with the internet service, but they added on another internet fee for August and for September! The total bill was $214! I do not dispute the regular price of the internet service quoted to me, which is $62.95 each month. The increase to that price is due to my not having a "bundled" plan any longer. But what I am disputing is their projected price for August of $85+ which includes internet, cable and modem rental. And to be double charged for internet services in August, and then the usual in advance charge for internet for September! After contacting customer service and speaking with three reps, all to no avail, I am very angry and frustrated to say the least! I should not have to pay this amount! Certainly the internet price quoted of $62.95 for the past month's usage, but where do they get the balance from last month of $85+ from? That should've reflected internet cost only!
__label__1 April of 2015 I ordered comcast internet. I was told I could hook up the modem myself and be charged 9.95. If they had to send out a tech they would charge me 39.99 (no charge if it's no fault of my own). Well, guess what? I could not get the modem to work. Comcast sent a tech to my home. The tech told me it would never have worked because comcast sent me a modem for the wrong region. He went back to his truck and switched modems and it worked. I called customer service and explained what happened. The gentleman told me someone would get back to me through an email. Week and a half no word.I called comcast back and spoke with a woman and explained my situation again. She said she seen the notes and asked if I could hold while she consulted a supervisor. I waited on the phone 45 minutes and someone came on the phone asking for all the information again. I told her I was on hold and that someone was helping me. She said they transferred me to her (the payment center). Again I had to explained all the information. By this point I have been on the phone an hour and a half trying to get my bill straightened out. Now, this woman transfers me once again. This time I asked for a supervisor so I don't keep getting pushed off on someone else. I explained what the tech had said about the modem. She said comcast didn't have modems for different region. Comcast can come get their stuff. Very poor customer service.
__label__1 Yesterday, I found out that my contract agreement has been dropped after one year and not two years.  My bill has jumped to $168.28 per month. On September 27th 2011, I called Comcast and spoke with Susan at 8:20pm.  She told me that my bill would automatically go up after my contract was up.  I told her that my contract was for two years; she told me that I have to wait until tomorrow to find out what my contract was.  She said that she was sorry, but that is all she could do.  A week later, I have received neither response nor contact.I am a college-educated mother with a child who is on the Nation School Lunch program.  I live in public housing and I work a full-time job as a server.  Now, I am spending 40% of my income to pay for cable, internet and telephone services.  Please check into this discrepancy and adjust my bill accordingly.
__label__5 It takes over 5 minutes of listening to a phone tree, advertising, and suggested additional products before one even gets to the queue for an agent. Sometimes the agents are knowledgeable. Sometimes the agents are clearly not native English speakers, and between lousy phone connections and unfamiliar accents (give me few minutes and I always get them), it is very difficult to do business by telephone. The chat service is very time consuming, even longer than a phone call due to the distances the messages are traveling, most frequently out of the Western Hemisphere. In store help is the same: inconsistent. Try to get an idea of your basic monthly bill amount: it is always understated, yet all the fees, taxes, etc., are static. TV pixelates often; phone service is adequate. Internet is very fast, but I pay quite a bit for that internet speed. Cable TV industry needs to realize that consumers like me would be happier if we could select from stations/programs/movies/tv shows as we go. Have a basic charge for the equipment and availability, then add on the additional channels. I have over 200 channels I don't use just to get the 10 channels I do watch. It seems that this type of monopolistic business model is inevitably going to kill itself off with services like AppleTV, Hulu, Netflix, etc., that are less expensive and easy to use. It is as reliable as overhead cabling will allow. If service were run underground, there would no doubt be fewer weather-related interruptions. If I did not need very high speed internet for my work and my housemate didn't want the cable TV, Comcast would be out of my life in any minute. I went cable TV free for a year before my housemate moved in, and it was fine using a hi-def antenna.
__label__1 Dropped calls, locked cable and extended outages. The Comcast repair is to power the cable box or modem off and send them a check! Cable box replaced 12 times over the last 3 years. Newest XFINITY box locks up every week. Service tech was a no show on Fathers Day and had me waiting... Finally showed up Tuesday and said to power cycle to fix problem (third call on this box). Tech on phone asked ME to remove cable box, return to Comcast and get new box, connect it and they would initialize it to repair problem. I asked him how much they would pay me to do their job that I was paying for service? They said nothing!
__label__1 I was lied to, intentionally, by two employees about the package they were offering. It sounded too good to be true so I explicitly asked and was told Yes. When the cable was installed and I saw the package was not what I had been promised, I called. After 4 transfers and a 2-hour hold from one rep to another (I think they were hoping I would hang up), I decided to go back to DirecTV, regardless of the cost. Worst service I have EVER had.
__label__1 I received a new cable modem from Comcast. I noticed it required a back up battery in order to maintain a telephone connection in the event of a power outage. I ordered one through Comcast website. It has not been delivered. I went on chat line to check status of order. The rep told me the item had been shipped and gave me a tracking number (which was wrong). I went on chat two more times, got no resolution. The 3rd chat told me No record of the order and in fact the battery had to be purchased at a Comcast Service Store. I went to store and was told "we do not stock that item". I left the store with another dissatisfied customer who was also cursing them - extremely poor service.
__label__0 My Internet stopped working.  My husband called customer "no" service to get some help, but the guy couldn't help.  So, my husband requested a tech come out to our house to take a look at it.  After much arguing, the tech finally scheduled the appointment for 5/3/11 between 8-10 am.  My husband requested the day off and we received automated calls and emails reminding us of the appointment.  We confirmed with the automated phone call that we did want to keep our scheduled appointment.  On 5/3/11, at 7:59 am, my cell phone rings.  My husband went outside to see if the tech was out front to let him know we were home, but no one was there.  I check my voicemail, it says, "This is Comcast calling regarding your appointment, call to reschedule."  What?I called right back and was on the phone with a rep.  I was told that I had to reschedule since I didn't pick up the phone.  It was 8:06 am.  Really?  Wow!  We were livid!  I asked to speak with a supervisor and was put on hold for 10 minutes.  And then the same rep came back on the phone.  She never got a supervisor and just repeated what she had said prior.  I asked to be transferred to a supervisor again and she blind transferred the call to another rep, not a supervisor.  I had to repeat everything I had already discussed with the previous rep.  So, after much arguing, I was finally transferred to a supervisor (it was after 9 am by this point, one hour into the phone call) who stated that my appointment wasn't cancelled and they would still be there by 10 am.  10:30 am hits, still no call, and no tech at my house.I called again and spoke with Surel who stated that the appointment had been cancelled.  What?  I was done!  I asked him to cancel my service.  I don't pay over $70 a month for Internet service just to be treated like this.  So he put me through to Bobby.  Bobby was very apologetic and friendly and even understanding.  He offered me an appointment for the same day from 2-4 pm and a $20 credit and $15 off my bill for the next 12 months.  I told him that was fine, but I was going to talk to my husband about still cancelling, and he understood.Well, so far, it is 3:58 pm and no call.  I guess we got cancelled again without us knowing.  My phone hasn't rang once, so they have two minutes to give me a call or they are going to get dropped.  I can pay $70 to someone who needs it and will value me as a customer.  Poor customer service.  Do not use them, they are awful!
__label__1 Late for Service Calls: Comcast scheduled a service tech to my address on Thursday, 29 Mar 2012, between 07:30 AM and 08:30 AM. The service tech was an hour and 15 minutes late and didn't install the additional line in a back bedroom that was requested on the initial work order that I placed on Wednesday, 28 March 2012. No one from Comcast called to advise me that the service rep would be an hour and a half late. I had to contact Comcast to inquire as to what happened and why the service tech was not on time. Comcast offered to send a service tech later that same day but I would have to remain at home all day to wait for a tech to arrive. I told them that I was not going to wait at home all day for a service tech to show up, especially when he didn't install the line when he did show up an hour and a half late.I asked the customer service rep to re-schedule the tech for the next day, Friday, 30 March 2012, at the same time between 7:30 AM and 8:30 AM, which she did. I got two calls before 7:30 AM to confirm that I was home and was assured that the tech would be there. I received a call at 8:33 AM on Friday, 30 March 2012, from the Comcast Dispatch stating that the tech would not be at my house until 9:45 AM, which is now 2 hours and 15 minutes late, an hour later than when he showed up on Thursday, 28 March 2012. This lateness by techs is unacceptable. I am appalled at having to wait on techs when I'm paying for their service and I shouldn't have to wait all day for a tech to show up for a pre-scheduled service call. I didn't call at the spur of the moment. I called the day before I needed the service. Management should be concerned because I'm sure that I'm not the only dissatisfied customer with this 'crappy' service that Comcast heaps on it customer. Do something about this now!
__label__0 I ordered the Comcast triple play for $99 a month. I have had the service for 8 months for a total of $792. I have paid them a total of $1082 and still owe $584. That is more than double the advertised price of $99 a month. The service was shut off without cause.
__label__1 Comcast has had my bundle business for quite a few years, so you would think that they would want to provide good customer service. Well think again. I called two weeks ago (the week of 20 July 2015) to ask them to come and move my cable line which is buried in the ground. I am trying to have a garage build and the line is in the way. I was given an appointment of Thursday, Aug. 6th. They were a no show. I called and was given another appointment of 8/8 between 9-11 AM. No show. I called a third time and was they would be here today 8/8 between 2-4:30 and still they never came. I am at my wit's end.
__label__1 I signed up for cable and internet in summer 2013. My total bill was $65.00 approx. After a year I received a letter from Comcast, informing me that they had made an error on many acct and that the package I had been paying for had a lot less channels than I was receiving and that they were removing many channels. I got another stating again they had made a error and my bill was going up by 20.00. Then believe it or not I received a third letter. This time they said that they had mistakenly not charge me for my extra box in the bedroom and that my bill would AGAIN increase by $10.00. So I was quoted $65.00 per month for a bunch of channels and a lil over a year later due to their mistake, I have half the channels and my bill is now $98.00 per month. FYI: our apt complex no longer allows satellite dishes, so we must use Comcast - isn't that ironic??
__label__1 The only thing on my credit report is from Comcast claim that I never returned a $500 cable box when I cancelled service. It's the worst company in any of the countries that I've lived in. I wouldn't open an account with them if they paid me to do so. Technically, the TV signals were OK. The internet was very slow even when I paid for premium "fast" service. Hugely overpriced. I only wanted one channel that they carried and the minimum I'd have to pay was over $80 per month.
__label__1 Despite having pictures of the error messages coming up on my screen directly from Comcast, they will not fix the service. With all the bad reviews, there should be a mechanism for the federal government to protect the consumer against the abuse and criminal treatment by Comcast.
__label__1 It seems that their system is not robust and actually quite fragile. Each time it rains the cable internet service goes out and it takes days to fix. They must not know how to learn how to make the service reliable for some reason. I'm running two businesses and Internet trading and can't do anything when service is out... using a phone is not a good option. For a company this big, it's surprising to me that they can't get a handle on robustness and reliability.
__label__0 On 4/2/10, I arrived home from work at approximately 5:00 pm. Upon entering my residence, I discovered that our Comcast equipment from our main living area had been disconnected and was missing. I spoke with my 12-year-old stepson who had been at the residence all day alone and he had indicated that "a man came in the house and took all of our stuff". Upon further investigation, I discovered that 4 other Comcast cable units that were located in our bedrooms and living corridors had also been disconnected and taken. My stepson stated that the man rang the doorbell and told him that he had to "get equipment that belonged to Comcast". He then entered into our home and removed said items from our bedrooms in the 2nd level of our home. This representative then left a Comcast slip called a "field collection receipt" on our table. The collection receipt included our address, a list of serial numbers, his representative ID number, and the former tenants last name. He removed the equipment believing that the former tenants still resided at this address without clarifying who did live here. Comcast gave us a new reconnect date and time and did not show up. I took time off from work and they were a no show. It took us a number of calls, return calls, and our personal time to get Comcast to make this right. Comcast then falsified the notes in their computer system to make it look like the representative did indeed remove the former tenants rented equipment and ours in the process, however, this home was vacant when we moved in and there was no equipment left behind. Our landlord can attest to that. Comcast has not been honest in this situation and a Comcast representative illegally entered into our home with a 12-year juvenile present and removed property that they did not have consent to remove. Comcast should never allow an adult to enter a home where a parent or legal guardian is not present. A child who cannot defend themselves should not be held responsible for allowing an adult to enter into a residence and into our private corridors because he is under the assumption that he is doing his job. This child's privacy and our home was invaded upon and trespassed against without a justifiable reason. All because he did not ask who lived at this residence yet just took it upon himself/or his orders to walk right in on a defenseless child.
__label__1 DID NOT tell me about promo rates etc. I asked repeatedly if rate would go up. They said no then raised my rate! Tell me later it was a promo rate. Even had a chat log where I asked over and over will the rate go up, they said NO!
__label__0 I am a Comcast customer in North Fort Myers Florida. I have cable tv and internet access. I've been reading where Comcast has been accused of throttling down broadband to limit download speeds and control how much you can download. I believe their comment was that they aren't doing this anymore. Well, let me tell you, they are here in SW Florida. We are supposed to have speeds here of over 5mb/s. I download PDF's from local county and city governments for construction projects in the area. (I'm a retired construction PM). I do this to keep my neighbors and family informed on projects that may impact them. I just this minute tried to down load a PDF file that was 5.2MB in size. Down load time was estimated at 11 minute and it took all of that. THAT IS THROTTLING!  This is not right. I don't do all that much. I pay for a certain speed and I ought to get what I pay for. They just don't care what they do and they also don't care a spit about public opinion because they are so big a monopoly.
__label__5 We decided to try to get Comcast internet. Service guys were unable to connect because there were no viable outlets. The service call was voided; however we just noticed we have been charged $51.95 a month since March 4th, 2013 (the date of the service call) for non existent internet. The bill has averaged out to about $145.00 monthly. Now all of a sudden there is a $20.00 rate hike for Digital Preferred. What was $39.95 is now $59.95. This in addition to the charge for invisible internet has become ridiculous.
__label__1 We have been without usable TV service for over a month. When watching TV the picture pixelates and the sound goes out. This has been an ongoing problem for 3-4 years. We have had a dozen service calls, half a dozen new cable boxes and hours and hours of calls to Comcast. I have called the corporate office twice and was assured that someone would call me back. That was 2 weeks ago and I have not talked to anyone at Corporate. We have talked to 3 call center supervisors and have been hung up on twice (no I was not yelling or cussing - just explaining the problem). We have been told that someone would rewire to our house but they never showed up. I was told they would check the lines on our street and call us. No one called.Comcast does not provide the service that they advertise and that I am paying for but every time I call they try to up-sell us additional services. This is a monopoly and should be regulated. They should be required to provide the services they bill for. Just look at this site, the BBB and any other complaint sites on the Internet. I am filing a complaint with my town, my state Attorney General, the FCC and the FTC but frankly this company seems to be bullet proof. I guess I should appeal to my state Senator and Representative as well.
__label__1 I have the performance package with Comcast. Internet only, one laptop, and I can not even stream the radio and type this. This is wrong, something needs to be done. No one else can even come to our area.
__label__1 I just read online my bill from Comcast/Xfinity. I was told about 6 weeks ago when I added some new TV programming that my total bill would be in the upper $80s - I don't have the exact amount. I asked a 2nd time and the total was confirmed. Just read now that for my upcoming bill, it will be $113+ instead of the $80+. I was told by a friend that he has been treated the same way, told one thing and charged another.
__label__1 I have been with Comcast for over a year now and have not had a complaint with them until now. After our Comcast introductory rate ended, I spoke with Judith at Comcast (employee own) to discuss what products could be taken off to reduce the bill. Obviously, like many, internet is not a necessity but a luxury especially in the economic environment.After a lengthy conversation, Judith at Comcast advised that we take off the "blast internet" to lower the monthly bill down $10.00 less to approximately $42.00 a month. While this was more expensive than what I was paying, it was understandable and manageable. I informed Judy that if the bill was any higher, I already had checked other servicers and told her I was ready to switch (which was also true and was prepared to switch to Century Link). Judith told me to wait and check the amount to pay on the online account which would allow me to continue at the rate of approximately $42.00/month without the "blast". To enforce our agreement, I checked the account which turned out to be around $15.00. All in all, Judith the Comcast representative undoubtedly stated she could keep our bill to around $42.00/month if we paid this extra amount to account for services already performed.Unfortunately, none of what Judith communicated to me was true. Comcast did not keep their word or honor their agreement. After paying the amount online as agreed, the next month I received a bill for over $115.00 which was not agreed upon and a breach of the agreement. After calling Comcast and speaking with employee Rob, he informed me that he could not lower the monthly bill and was not sure what Judith did on the account (big shocker that Comcast does not keep accurate notes the same way I did). Rob informed me that he reported Judith's actions to his supervisor and would credit my account $44.00 for the difference between what I was informed to pay online and what the bill later had in it. I understand promotional rates and roping in customers but when an agent flat out lies to you about a budgeted monthly expense and leads you to stay with a company only to hit you with a bill almost three times your normal monthly rate, that is an unethical bait and switch and downright dishonest. As a consumer, I need to report this information and shed light on the practices that Comcast agents are using to deceive their customers.
__label__5 I paid for my services in full until July 27, 2012. My next bill was generated on July 14, 2012. No problem. I was moving so my equipment was turned in on July 17, 2012. When I got the final bill, it said I had a credit of $4.23. The difference between the bill generated on the 14th and the one generated on the 21st is amazingly confusing. Even though I had paid through the 27th, by the 21st, my final bill showed I had a previous balance of $171.99. This was how much service from July 28 - August 27, 2012 would have cost me. No problem, except when the credits were issued, instead of being credited the whole $171.99 and then receiving credit for the ten days in July which I had already paid for, my final bill was only broken down into days at daily rate from July 17 - August 27, 2012.Nothing adds up to just dropping what July 28 - August 27 would have cost me ($159.02 because I do owe $12.97 on that bill for pay per view) plus ten days of credit from July 17 - July 27, 2012. The only thing the customer service representative would even try to explain to me was the bills which were right in front of me. I can read. After over 45 minutes of back and forth, she offered to get me to a supervisor but conveniently, this person was unavailable and I am supposed to receive a call back. I never have before, I don't see why I would this time.
__label__1 Comcast is cheating customers and charging extra for reconnect fees. I have been trying to get a hold of a supervisor since last Sept 2, 2016. My husband called in to dispute our bill. The lady was very rude speaking over him, and then he asked to be transferred to a supervisor and was told a supervisor is busy and not available but one would call him back, within the hour. Saturday morning 9/3/16. I called to get a supervisor since nobody had given him a call back. I sat on hold for 1 hr and 42 mins before someone picked up. When I asked for a supervisor the representative refused and stated something else. When I told her I could not understand her (she had an Indian nationality accent) she became upset and sent me back through the automated system, which then hung up on me. I called back a second time and sat on hold for 1 hr and 45 min this time and then I got a representative who stated he could not listen to my complaints because the call was going to be cut off, and so he had to do his part quickly and we needed to stick to only my billing issue, not the complaint I wanted to file against the previous representative. The representative stated he had taken care of everything and that we should not have an issue. Well Tuesday 9/5/16 Comcast disconnects our cable stating we owe 15.42. My husband kept asking where this balance on the bill is because we had been through this before with them stating we own money but nobody could point out where the money was owed on our account. He asked for a supervisor again and again was told one would call him back. Sat 9/3/16 we had just paid 242.50. He asked why did the representative not include this 15.42 and he was told we do not know, because he should have seen it. He proceeded to ask for the supervisor a second time and at that time, he was told one is not available but we will send over the message to have them give you a call. He informed the representative he had been waiting since last Friday for one to call and they had not. At that time the representative assure him she was sending over the message and someone would be calling. Thursday 9/15/16. I call into Comcast because our cable is off. I was told by a representative that the person I had spoken with on the 3rd did not put in correct notes. I asked why a supervisor had not called back we had been waiting, I was informed that she was not sure but if I wanted one to call me back she would send over the message. I stated this is ridiculous and after waiting over a week I expected a call back that day. The representative stated she was sending the message over urgent and someone would call me back. Mind you she did not even ask me for a phone number. She states she had corrected the mess up for the representative on the 3rd and that everything should be fine. I asked her about the 15.42 mystery balance she states "I do not see this. I do not see you all owed 15.42." I explained our services had been stopped 3 times during this week and I was not paying a reconnect fee for a surprise 15.42. I was informed that the fees would be waived and that our services were good until 9/16/16 which we could just pay on or after 9/16/16 which is the bill due date. I stated I still want a call back from a supervisor because this is ridiculous. Well Sat morning 9/17/16 the service is off stating again we owe the balance that nobody could find. I called twice after I went ahead and paid the current balance of our bill to dispute these issues that have now been going on for 2 weeks. I was on hold the first time for 33 min and 42 sec. I then got a voicemail that stated someone would call me back. I had left a voicemail at 0830 Sat morning. I left a voicemail by 3 pm. I called again because the dept I was needing to speak with according to the automated machine was only open Sat 8-5 central time. I called at 2 pm I was on hold for 34 min and 0 seconds. Again this voicemail picks up, states I need to leave a message and someone would call me back. I never received a call back on Sat. Monday 9/19/16 I call and I finally get someone named Johnthan on the phone and I informed him I was very upset and I wanted a supervisor. He then states he is transferring me to a supervisor. Another representative picks up the phone. I ask are they a supervisor. He states no. I informed him I wanted a supervisor, he informed me he can handle my issue. I stated to him no I wanted a supervisor. My issue had been going on long enough. He states I need to let him look into my issue. I stated to the representative no I wanted a supervisor. He states to me I need to let verify my account. I informed him I had already done this with the previous representative and I wanted a supervisor. He then sends me to a man named Josh, who states he is a supervisor. I informed him I was not paying all these reconnect fees for them not doing what they are supposed to do when the customer calls in, and expects Comcast to be competent. He states he will waive 1 $36 dollar reconnect fee. I informed Josh I was not happy and I would be going to consumer affairs. Josh stated ok and we ended the call. I feel Comcast did this on purpose as a way to make our bill higher. I also have a problem when you are waiting on a supervisor to call you back for 2 weeks and they do not, and then you have to leave a voicemail at a company this big and you still never receive a call back. Comcast is purposely ripping off consumers.
__label__0 I have a Comcast service plan for cable/internet/phone package that totals $120.93/month. I received a call from a Comcast representative indicating that my promotional period has ended for the bundled package and my rate will go up to nearly $148.00/month - a nearly 23% increase. First, when I decided to go with the bundle package of service Comcast did not tell me this was a promotional rate. I specifically asked the sales representative if the prices would go up on the bundle has it had with cable and the representative seid it would not. But here now a year later it is going up 23% and there's no alternative broadband cable available in Attleboro to contact for a competitive service.
__label__1 Comcast offered me a deal that was going to cost me a one time fee of $60 for installation, and $60 a month for service. I agreed to this and 2 weeks later I'm being billed for $250 with all these added monthly fees... Currently I'm disputing the charges. Comcast's agent lied to me and promised these prices that he seems to have just made up. There is no accountability and getting through the phone support is a nightmare. This makes me sick to my stomach and is extremely frustrating. Shame on Comcast for running a business like this.
__label__1 Comcast truck number ** Colorado plate ** Worker number ** shows up to connect my neighbor's cable and instead disconnects my internet. NOT only was he extremely rude he also blamed yet another worker for HIS mistake. Now I have no internet and have to wait for yet another idiot to fix their mistake. Service with a sneer. Now I am paying for internet I don't get!
__label__1 I lived in an 80 unit condo complex where Comcast Xfinity was the only cable choice. I suffered with poor customer service, constant error messages (i.e. this channel will be available shortly), incessant pixilation of most HD programs, and constant excuses from their staff. I find it most interesting that there is now an opportunity for FIOS to become available if there is sufficient interest of the owners. Almost 100% are itching to dump Comcast for Verizon. I was not the only dissatisfied Comcast customer.
__label__1 I subscribed to triple play three months ago. I didn't realize at the time I was signing on for a two year contract as that was never discussed, so basically I'm stuck and I've been told that by one of their reps. I have been on the phone with them on a weekly basis because service is sporadic with regards to cable, internet & phone. I have to set aside at least 1 hour 45 minutes for each phone call before I get someone to "help". As I am typing this I am waiting for a tech to come to my house. The appt was from 9-1. I have also been on the phone for 45 minutes with Comcast. They are telling me tech has been to house and resolved issue (not the case). Their automated service says appt is for tomorrow from 9-11, which was discussed, but I explained I would not be home and it would have to be Monday so he gave me Monday 9-1 and gave me a confirmation number. Now at 12:29 they will see if they can get a tech out. They will call me back when they know. Another day wasted. If anyone wants triple play service go to Verizon. Run from Comcast.
__label__5 I have been a long time customer of ComCast for years. On January 3rd my apartment was lost to a fire and severe water damage as to where I could never go back. The following day I called and explained what happened and stopped the service. Today is January 25th and they are still harassing me about the equipment. Then I moved into a new place and the service was turned on January 14th so the mailboxes are outside my apt and the guy sees a # 3 (not my unit) and connects it to them, but it must have been on in my apt already. On January 15th in the middle of playoffs second quarter the cable goes out, I speak to a very ignorant man named Hassan who assures me that in 15 min all should be well.  45 minutes later I call again, then another winner named James proceeds to tell me, Oh your cable is off! Then I ask to speak to a manager in the Jacksonville FL office. He then connects me to on purpose to a closed office (where do they find they people?).On Monday after 11 tries, I finally get in contact with a Manager Matthew **. He explains that the rep that came out connected the wrong unit, great! Then I go through the whole story and he states ok fax me a copy of fire report I did. Then he seems to say I had a credit on previous account since I had just paid my bill on 12/31/11 and home was destroyed on 01/03/12 ( go figure) Then he says he will fix the problem with the cable and the old box. Great so I thought.On January 23rd I get a bill? When Matthew told me I will have no cable bill for two months and he will fix the box issue. Now I have received a call every day since the 18th about the equipment, no clue about fire or anything else and a new bill. **? I'm 43 years old and have been in the Sales and CSR industry for 25 years and these have got to be the most ignorant, uneducated morons that I have ever had the misfortune to have dealt with. This is all typed while being on hold for 25 minutes to speak to a manager.  Yeah Right. Hung Up! So still no resolution. I Hate Comcast! Im on to the 85th call
__label__0 I have moved and had no choice but to take Comcast for my TV services. I would rather choose Direct, but my leasing company would not accommodate my use of the roof for the antenna. I had an initial setup date of 6-17. I received a call on the 13th that my appointment was for the 15. I took the day off and to no avail. Surprise, no one showed up. On the 17th at 6 pm, I had two boxed installed. On the 17th at 9pm, the second box stops working. So I called tech support who could not understand what the issue was. Of course, they gave me another appointment for a time that I would not be able to be home (12 pm to 2 pm). I waited all day on the 18th for someone to come; no one showed. No call either. Today the 19th, I called to schedule someone to come out to the house. They stated that someone showed up on the 18th and there was no answer. Thats not true. We were waiting. Now, I have to drive the non-working box to the nearest Comcast site to exchange the box. Hopefully, a new box will work and it is not some other issue. I was told that I would not be reimbursed for my gas that I now have to use.
__label__5 I purchased a new TV in December 2010. I contacted Comcast of New Haven to set up new box for TV. I had several technicians out, outsourced help and five non-working boxes. I finally got fed up and put in a complaint to PURA (Public Utility Control Agency) online. A person called me and I explained my problem that I'd been having for almost three solid months. I was granted a credit for my problem but still have to wait for an adjusted bill. Once this is settled, I'll feel better, but I'm considering switching services. My sister changed company and I'm waiting to see how she likes it. Only a few more weeks and I may switch. If you have a utility problem, call Public Utility Control in your area. That's their job and they may be able to help after you've tried to resolve it yourself. Good luck!
__label__1 I moved from an apt that included Comcast to one where I needed to set up my own account. I went online a week before the move and signed up for service giving them $100 deposit. This is where the nightmare begins. After 5+ days, the equipment never arrived. I called and after waiting 20 minutes talked to a support person in India. They told me my order was cancelled because of a 911 issue?? Couldn't explain what that was either. Okay, they re-instated my account and I told them I would pick up the equipment. I went to the Comcast store and picked up the equipment. When I got home I plugged everything in and called to activate the service. Again, India support person could not get the service to activate. An error was coming back from my box. Did I mention it was the last game of the World Series that I couldn't watch unless this service was activated? I was transferred to billing because there was an open work order on the phone number. When billing answered it was voicemail!! I was on that call for 45 minutes. Called back. Again, another India support person, same issue. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and was disconnected. I think that's the tactic for getting an angry customer off their back. Finally I gave up for the night but I missed the game and wasted 90 minutes of my time. The next day called again and asked for a service man to come out free of charge to get my service up and running. I was transferred 5 times and finally was able to speak to an American who promised someone would be out the next day between 3-5 to turn on my service. I got a call that night giving me a new phone number. Apparently, there was something in pending on my number and that would remove the work order. NO ONE told me that! At this point, I was so livid I didn't care about the phone number. The next day at 2:50, I got a call from Comcast saying the service man would be there between 3-5. HE NEVER SHOWED UP!! I called and the recording said, Oops we see we missed your appointment. An Indian got on again and told me the service man was running late. Why didn't I get a call from him? It was 6:30 - 1.5 hours late! Then I questioned him about why did I get the Oops we missed your service message, and he said the service man wasn't coming! He actually tried lying to get me off the phone. Needless to say, I called Verizon and spoke to an American after 2 rings - no wait time - who was very knowledgeable. They are sending me the equipment and a $50 gift card because it will take a couple days! I am taking the equipment back to Comcast today and cancelling ALL work orders. Wonder how long that will take to get straight. Right now I'm worried about getting my $100 back! DON'T EVER SIGN UP FOR COMCAST!! The service is extremely bad. The people in India just want to get you off the phone and will tell you what you want to hear just to get you to hang up. The most misleading thing of all is the President of the company on the website saying how great their customer service is. What company is he in charge of?? It's not the Comcast I dealt with.
__label__0 I switched to them in February from a satellite company because they promised me a bundled rate of $60 for 12 months. Now I am being charged $100 a month. I got 1 extra service (HBO) and I have 3 boxes, of which I pay $7 extra a month for (all of which I got when I signed up for the service and I was paying the $64,79 as promised). I got rid of the HBO because that was $16 more a month. I still have the $4 starz package.   The person on the other end told me that the rate for the internet that I was getting was only for 6 months. Yes, that was supposed to be a part of my 12 month bundled service.   I tried to get rid of STARZ just now and they said they would have to charge me $5 just to delete it.  So when I got that news I told the girl I wanted to speak to a supervisor. She said there were none currently available. I told her I would wait.  So I waited.   And waited.  And waited.  I waited for over an hour (my phone has a minute timer on it) and still no supervisor.   I finally hung up. I am disgusted that I am a PAYING (never been late) customer.   Does anyone know what I can do to maybe get my rates back down? I already told on the other end that I was offered a better deal with dish network and she IGNORED it. other than losing an hour and 12 minutes of my time i am losing about $40 a month.
__label__1 Worst customer service EVER. I spent four hours on the phone with six people on two continents over the course of three days, trying to fix an internet problem that it turned out THEY caused. I then spent another hour with three more people trying to get the $110 worth of fees they'd landed me with (for the problem they caused) removed from my bill. The reps, or laughably named "account executives," are worse than useless. The first two I spoke with had no suggestions at all besides "unplug it and then plug it back in". With the first, I could hear other people coaching him from the background. The third flat-out lied to me to get me off the phone. I didn't get the same answers from any two reps, and as it turned out, none of the answers they gave me were right anyway. If Comcast is allowed to merge with Time-Warner, it will be a kick in the face to every customer in the country. As far as I can tell, the only reason most people are signed on with Comcast is because there is no other option. It's certainly the case with me - I'd leave in a heartbeat if there was any other service provider in my area.
__label__1 When I attempt to reply to an email the text block fills with hundreds of garbage characters. They cannot be erased. When I hit the reply icon on their toolbar the entire toolbar becomes inoperable and nothing is sent. Their Customer Service does not comprehend the problem. They read through a script that has nothing to do with the issue. They will not let me talk to a supervisor, nor a resident U.S. citizen, nor an email expert. My email has been inoperable for a month. No one there listens or cares or does anything about the problem.
__label__1 My brother-in-law lived with us and had the service under his name.  He moved out and transferred his cable Internet to his new place.  We ordered the new service at our address the same day with a self-install.  During the self-install, a guy from Comcast showed up saying that he was from the termination services.  We told him we had ordered the new service and that we're doing the self-install.  He left and disconnected us anyways.  I repeatedly tried to get the cable to work but to no avail.  I finally called and found out that their guy had disconnected us on the outside switch which we cannot access.  I called in and they agreed to send someone out to fix the problem.  They said that if it was the outside switch, I wouldn't be charged since it was their mistake.  They sent someone, and sure enough, it was the outside switch.  He turned it back on, and my signal began working. Now, one month later, the company is trying to charge me $50 for turning the switch back on when their mismanagement of the account is what caused the guy to come out and turn the switch off in the first place.  I feel like a cop slashing my tire and then writing me a ticket for it.  I feel helpless against a giant company that refuses to waive a fee that I should not have to pay.  I am very upset with them.
__label__1 I am writing to let you know of unethical business practices by Comcast. As far as I know, Comcast holds a monopoly at my address as Comcast is apparently the only high speed internet service available to me at my Olympia address. On December 15, 2012, my internet service quit working. I called Comcast to report the outage or malfunction. I was put on hold for probably the better part of an hour. Eventually, my call was transferred. After transfer, I was offered a service for under $10.00 (it was either $9.95 or $9.99, but I can't remember which). I was told that it would be a one-time charge and that if I agreed to pay nearly $10.00, they could fix the problem - which according to them was my problem, not Comcast's. I was impressed with the fact that the agents on the phone seemed incompetent and incapable of listening to me to find out the description of the problem. They put me on hold again. I was impressed with what appeared to be their method of guessing what the problem might be and guessing how it might be fixed. I'm a good guesser too, so I wasn't too sure that I wanted to pay them almost $10.00 to do what I could do equally well myself, but I was in a state of disbelief at that moment because I thought that rationally they should know what they are doing. While I was on hold, I fixed the problem myself. When the agent came back on the line, I said never mind. I didn't need their help and I didn't want to go back on hold again. They said okay. We hung up.Later, I received a letter from Comcast captioned: Welcome to Xfinity Signature Support. This looked suspicious to me, as if I were signed up from something I didn't want. So I called Comcast on December 26, 2012 to inquire and to make sure I wasn't going to get billed. I was put on hold for more than an hour. When an agent finally came on the line, she told me that the charge would be removed and that the subscription would be cancelled. I thanked her and I hung up. On January 11, 2013, the monthly bill from Comcast arrived. There was a charge of $39.00 for an item described as enrollment fee with a sub-line as follows: Wireless Networking and Computer Performance. I called Comcast about the charge at 2:30PM on January 12, 2013. I was put on hold. I was on hold for more than an hour until 3:38PM, when the battery on my cordless phone died. On the same day, at 4:10PM, I called again. I was put on hold. At 6:35PM, the phone died when the battery expired. I never spoke with anyone. The charge on my bill is fraudulent. I never asked for the service, was never informed of the charge, and never agreed to it. The only thing I was ever informed of was a one time charge of less than $10.00, but the agents who provided the service appeared to be incompetent. All they ever did for me was keep me on hold. I told them never mind and that I didn't want their help after all, and they said okay. I thought that I might nevertheless get scammed out of $10.00, but I am very surprised to see a bill for $39.00. I would proudly discontinue any business relationship with Comcast, but as I said initially, as far as I know Comcast is the only business that provides high speed internet at my address in Olympia. I would proudly drop out and refuse to subscribe to any internet, cable television or telephone services, but the fact is that I need internet for more than mere amusement. But there's only one high speed internet provider, Comcast, who rips me off. Please help.
__label__1 I cancelled Comcast. I returned the boxes and was still receiving bills as if I had service and equipment. After many faxes and attempts, Im still dealing with it over 2 months later. Then to top it off, Comcast sent a rep to my home, who in turn questioned my 17-year old son about my account, payment and boxes they state I have. No one will acknowledge what happened. No return call or investigation has been done into this. I know it is illegal for this to happen due to my son being under 18 and he even told them this and to wait for me to come home. They told my son to call me and tell me to come home to pay or return the boxes I do not have. To this day, 41 days later, I was told by a rep from Comcast these exact words: What do you want us to do about it? I want it fixed. I want an answer for a correct bill to pay and my boxes I returned to showthis is what I want. Nothing done as of yet. No resolution, no call back. Still frustrated with no answers. Can not even give one good star for overall experience. 
__label__1 Ordered the TV & Internet double package that I received from Xfinity mailer promotion. When installer arrived, he had been given a different order to install incorrect boxes and service. Some of this problem was corrected while he was doing the install, however after installation, I found I was billed way above the quoted costs. After 3 1/2 hours on the phone with 8 different representatives, I was still not given the package that was advertised and now 2 of the receiver boxes continue to drop signal. I am averaging 11/2 hour per day trying to get this corrected. My internet speed is not the speed I was told I would receive. I tried to replace one of the receivers that is dropping and was sent a box that was not what I ordered. Customer service reps seem to be of no help and only answer any question by reading their prepared texts. Now I find that pending charges exceed quoted prices again. I can guarantee that when my contract expires. Xfinity will never have me as a customer again.
__label__1 When equipment malfunctions (frequently) you have to either drive miles to the one service office, and wait usually over a half hour in line to exchange it, or pay for someone to bring a replacement to your house. Almost impossible to contact a live service person on phone. Both difficult and expensive to deal with when problems arise that they should correct to maintain service. Much too expensive, but the alternative is "rabbit ears" in my suburban neighborhood. Frequent partial outages of some channels, freezing programs, and deteriorating signals. My recommendation - avoid if at all possible.
__label__0 I pay $190 per month for combined TV, Phone and Internet. For the past week, every single morning, our phone and cable has gone out for 2 to 6 hours. Customer service are polite, but tell me to reset the modem or some other stupid thing. When I tell them others in the neighborhood are having the same problem with Comcast, they deny they have an area related problem.  Actually, they have no way of knowing that unless a sufficient number of complaints are received.  I suspect (based on trucks in the area), they are installing new customers and don't give a damn about people who already subscribe.
__label__5 TV goes out, cannot get Comcast to respond in a timely manner. Rates keep going up while customer support has dropped off. Not enough staff to answer phones because when I call it takes longer for someone to answer. And when they do answer they are trying to sell some other service. My picture goes out, I call Comcast. They say they're working on it. I call back and I am put on hold for ten minutes or more. Or if they answer quickly they are trying to sell me. Much too expensive. And my building is sold out to Comcast so I cannot go to another source to even try to get a better deal. The most reliable thing is getting billed every month and the bill goes up. They should have a resource for the elderly. Some advocate to appeal the process they take senior citizens through.
__label__1 Been a Comcast customer since 2004 (more than 10 years) and shocked at their treatment to a loyal customer. 4/23 - I saw a door tag saying Xfinity technician had been to our area and identified an issue either Ingress or Egress. I still have this tag. To avoid service I was supposed to call the Comcast office and schedule a time to repair the problem. I checked with my in-laws who were home and they said internet has been down since morning. I called immediately and was on the phone for more than 45 minutes. I asked the CS person if there will be a charge as I do not want to pay for this. I was told there will be no charge so I scheduled an appointment for next day.4/24 - I took off for half a day to be home but the technician did not show up. I called customer service and was told the technician was there and took care of the problem from outside and did not have to come inside my home. I checked my internet and it was still down. I told the rep this and she tried to get technical support. We tried pinging and connecting to the modem but there was no connectivity. I was asked to make another appointment for tech to come and check it. I complained that I took half a day off and it cost me half a day's pay as I had no vacation days to take for this. The rep came back saying I will get credit for internet for the month. I thought that is pretty fair and agreed to another appointment.4/26 Rep came home and started investigating outside first. He said there were cables outside which had signal leaks and he had to replace a few of them at the location where all the wires come in. He then also said my splitter was old and he replaced it. This was outside the house again. I had two modems which I own and he recommended I use the newer one which is Docsis 3. I said ok and he set it up and internet was back. After a few days, I received a bill with $50 for the tech visit and I called Comcast to dispute this. They said they will credit this and should show in next bill. I also asked for the internet credit which the CS said we cannot get. I told the CS I was told on the last call that there will be a credit but CS did not budge. I was furious to say the least. I said I want to cancel all my services if Comcast is not honoring their word. Didn't make a difference, CS did not even make an attempt to forward me to retention. Just took my request and asked what date I want to cancel the service. Wow! So much for being a customer for 10 years.My billing period was 11th to 10th of the month. Two weeks before May 11th I requested cancellation of my service with Comcast. They sent me a box with prepaid UPS label for shipment. I did not request this as I was planning to go to the local office. But since I received the boxes and shipping label, I went ahead and shipped it out on May 12th and it was delivered on May 13th. I also have confirmation of delivery to the address Comcast had on the label.Since then, I have got 3 invoices with missing equipment charges, tech visit charge, and modem charge which was ridiculous as I owned my own modem at all times. I have been called by third party companies claiming equipment recovery which I have refused and provided UPS tracking for delivery confirmation. I have wasted too much time on the phone with these uncouth business. 6/30 account is still not closed out. Comcast remains the same stubborn self not doing nothing to assist a long time customer in a positive way. Even thoughts of probably using their service sometime in the future are out of the question now.
__label__1 My wife spent three hours on the phone for them to fix our internet. It took them 3 hours to figure out we are on the slow internet service. Now the internet cuts out, wifi doesn't work. Technician came out and put a new cable on the ground, everything was working, now the internet cuts out again. My wife waited all day on Saturday for the technician to come out. When the technician replace the cable, he said everything was okay. I am NOT happy with Comcast and will change over when a better service shows up.
__label__0 I have 2 TWO accounts in my name...one in Boulder (NEW) and one in Golden (OLD).  I would like the Boulder account to also be set up for autobill to my credit card but it doesn't even appear on comcast.com under my account. BTW, I called and spent 20 min on the phone with Comcast this morning only to be redirected here--to a dead end. All I want to do is CONSOLIDATE both bills to be billed to a credit card each month so I don't have to write a check.  I can't access the Boulder(NEW) account to do that because I can't even see it on website. only see "Change account name" under Account Summary. There is no option to add an account My Golden account is set up to automatically BILL TO A CREDIT CARD.  I want my Boulder account to do the same. If I were able to access my Boulder account, I wouldn't be wasting my life talking to [them].  NO--I can't access my Boulder account. Why is this so difficult to understand? If the account isn't there to begin with, what good will it be to reset my password? Why can't [they] list both accounts under my ONE name? I gave up.  Like talking to a turnip. SOME CEO at COMCAST needs to be accountable and make himself visible instead of playing the "Man Hiding Behind the Curtain" as in the Wizard of Oz. No where on Comcast's website is there a way to escalate complaints to a regional manager or VP, etc.  Oh, and when I set up the order to install new service, they didn't do it right and they had to come back a second time, which resulted in more missed time (for me) from work to meet their window/timeframe of when they could be available. Customer service is a joke in this company! They prefer to keep their heads in the sand and their hands in customers' pockets.

__label__0 I am being ripped of by Comcast Cable regarding my billing.  I have had expanded/standard cable for years.  (The monthly cost for my area on their internet site states $32.78 per month), (the recent letter I received from Comcast states prices for my area also states $32.78 per month). My bill states I have cable (video) services which is not available in my area, and this is stated on comcast's internet site.  Ms. Talley states she did not know why this was on my bill.  I have got the run around period from comcast/employees with no solution to my problem.  I have copies of all e-mails I have written and all copies comcast have written me, I also have years of past receipts where I paid  and have been over charged for cable with comcast, and customer service does not seem to care or want to help me.
__label__0 I had an appointment with a technician to come to the house to install a cable for internet access and to check the connection for HD TV (not receiving a signal). They were to be out on Dec. 8, 2009 between 8 and 11 am. They said the technician showed up at 11:05 and no one was home. You would have to believe with 4 vehicles and 3 people at the house with garage open that someone had to be there. When I called, they said a dispatcher would contact me before 2 at the number I gave them to call which the lady on the phone even verified was the number to be contacted. I never received a call. When I called the number again, they said a technician would be out between then and 8 pm and was a must do. When I called back at 7:45 pm, they said the technician called and had no answer which is bull because it's my cell and I had on me for one reason - to answer Comcast's call and there is no number listed and I know they didn't call or it would be listed on my cell.
__label__0 On March 4, 2009, I discontinued my service with Comcast due to moving to South Florida. My account was paid by credit card and upon receiving my bill in April, the account was noted to have a $22.62 credit on my account #**. In April 2009, I returned to my residence in Orange Park, Florida and had my cable and internet access re-established with Comcast. The young man who came to install my services said he was not the regular installer but was here to do the job. His installation number is **, and he made the statement to me that the modem is running slow. I'm not sure this is working properly. If not, you can take care of it at a later date. These services were completed on April 2, 2009. I paid $156.50 to reinstall Comcast internet and cable. On the evening of April 3, 2009, Orange Park experienced a rather bad electrical storm and my internet went out. On the morning of April 4, 2009, I called Comcast to report no lights on the modem and that I did not have internet service. The young woman from Comcast said there was no signal at my house and scheduled a repairman to come out on Monday to see what the problem was. I waited the entire day but no one showed up. I called that day and according to your voice message, the appointment for service was the following week. Now mind you, why would I want to want an additional week for a repairman if I hadn't had service since the day I had the cable re-installed?I spoke with Eric on April 6, 2009 and he couldn't seem to help me. He kept putting me on hold and then he dropped my call into the Orlando cue and I spoke with someone there who didn't know how I got her and she couldn't help me. I called back the local Comcast number and spoke with Ellen who was very apologetic about the entire situation. She informed me Comcast was very busy and they could not come out to my house to diagnose the problem until Thursday April 8, 2009. I informed her of the above situation and asked her why the other Comcast representative didn't tell me this information but just made an appointment for a week later. Now mind you, I have been without internet service for six days from April 3 to April 8. Per Ellen, she said a $20 credit and no internet charges for April 3-April8, 2009 would be on my bill. I spent over 45 minutes of cell phone use just trying to get someone to come out and fix the problem. This is very poor customer service.When the repairman finally came, he said the cable from the box to the house is completely dead. He also replaced the modem. My bill came this month, and yes, there is a credit of $20 and $7.15. There is also a charge for $30 for T/C Trip charge. Prior to my discontinuing Comcast in March 2009, my husband and I were great Comcast customers. Our account was always paid on time actually before the bill was due. I am very disappointed in Comcast. It appears that lightning must have struck your outside cable but you charged me $30 for this to be assessed. I find it kind of strange that prior to the cable being re-installed, I had the $2.95 service plan and had no problems. I reinstalled the cable and the day I reinstalled the cable/internet, there is a problem with lightning and I get dinged for the service charge. This is not right. I want a tracer to find out where my $22.62 credit is and I want the $30 T/C Trip credited to my bill for next month. I have already paid this month's bill. I have tried to call and speak with someone/anyone about this problem. No one seems to know how to handle the problem. I can be reached at ** should you need to speak with me about this problem. I am enclosing a copy of all bills, credit slips and installation receipt. In this bad economy, cable TV and internet services are a luxury, not a necessity. Can you afford to lose me, a good customer? Check my account. It has always been paid on time. Thank you.
__label__1 We decided to cancel our cable and go with Directv. So after calling Comcast and dropping the cable, they hiked our internet up to $90. At that point we decided to go with Century Link for our internet. On the same day that Directv and Century Link were coming out, my husband took ALL equipment back to Comcast. Now we are getting calls for us to return our equipment. Every time we've called them back, they say it does show we returned the equipment, and they are issuing us a refund check. But guess what- we keep getting calls about the equipment. So today when I spoke to them, all of a sudden they say it doesn't show any equipment being returned. They have to be the most unscrupulous company that we have ever had the misfortune of coming in contact with. I hope their karma catches up to them soon!!!
__label__1 Hmm, let's see where to begin.... Their speeds are not accurate no matter where you live. I've had the misfortune of living in two areas where they own a monopoly and it was never the speed they sold you. You are INCREDIBLY lucky if you can get through to talk to someone without them or the automated system hanging up on you. My BIGGEST complaint is how they will pad the bill and not tell you. Just don't take the story I'm about to tell you. Read all the others posted here on this forum. Somehow when I upgraded my service last year & bought myself a new modem (from Best Buy) for the DOCSIS 3.0 upgrade, the billing team decided to put down I was renting the DARN thing.... I didn't notice till one year later and all I got was a sorry and $20 credit. If they didn't have a monopoly in my current region, I would definitely change in a flash.
__label__1 After being double billed for TV and Internet installation. Having numerous problems with billing, TV and Internet service problems, (outages, picture freeze and numerous DVR re-boots), i cancelled service and will never go back to Comquash again. I cannot understand why anyone can be happy with constant outages and excuses when there are other more reliable TV and Internet services our there. This was my first and last experience with Comcast. They are surely not going to get my recommendation in the future.
__label__1 I live in Sammamish, WA where Comcast is the monopoly cable company. I have been having problems with my internet and cable service for over a month. Comcast has the worst customer service process for customers to even get to somebody to report problems. It takes 20 minutes on average to get someone on the line while they are blasting you with commercials as you hold for a live person. They make you repeat the same info about tel. #, address, last four digits of social, etc.Half the people answering the phone cannot communicate properly in English. It is like the company wants people to get frustrated holding the line forever to get a representative and give up instead of solving their problems. All the while, they keep raising rates and trying to upsell services while you are just complaining about not getting even the basic service in spite of paying for it. It seems like there is no way to get your problems addressed by Comcast. I welcome any suggestions on how to get Comcast to respond to customers' service problems.
__label__0 I signed up for Comcast High Speed Internet at $19.99 per month for one year. This is still their advertised special. I received it at $29.99 per month. I explained that the $29.99 was neither the rate I was quoted nor the advertised rate. They refused to lower the rate. Additionally, the modem that serves both my internet connection and my existing phone service stops working several times per day and must be reset. This is a problem they are unable to fix. I am willing to accept the below par phone service but I feel the $10.00 difference between the advertised high speed internet rate and the billed rate is unfair. No damage, these people just waste time and wear me out.
__label__1 After two years with Verizon, I've returned to Comcast to completely different experience. They were ready to offer inexpensive stand-alone Internet with no contract and obligations.  They sent me a self-installation kit (I had already had the wiring) for just 10 dollars, and they did not try to put hidden fees.  I have had their service for 2 months now to my complete satisfaction.  (I am one of so-called "cable cutters": I have The Internet from Comcast, phone from Magic Jack that is almost free and the news and entertainment from Roku, Amazon and Sling.)Original ReviewComcast bombed me with advertising about their triple play for $79.99 a month for 12 months and eventually, I agreed which started on Dec. 12, 2012. It was a complete fraud. They sent me maybe 10 e-mails that my rate is $99.99. After at least a dozen phone calls, agent-supervisor Sharon (ID **) sent me a letter dated Dec. 19, 2012, with a detailed description of my charges. It was satisfactory, the first bill was in accordance with her letter and I thought that the problem was settled. I was naive!On Jan. 8, 2013, I received an unsigned letter that they erred in billing me and starting the next month, my bill will go up from $106 to $115.95! I have never accepted even the $106 charge! I called to the Comcast headquarters in Philadelphia. A person named Chuck returned me a call and tried to convince me that because they gave me a $25 credit, my $116 - $25 = $91 still be good and I need to be happy even though I signed for $79.99. The issue has been unresolved.I am 75 years old and I may get heart attack from all these dealings. Just do not trust them and do not sign up with Comcast.
__label__1 Went to LaPorte office today since both calls for repair service were answered by people in Mexico, who said it would be 4 days before a repairman could respond. Cable running along road that serves my residence and my neighbors' is at fault. Woman in office called both supervisors and repair people and they totally ignored her call! Paying $168.00+ per month and it takes 4 days for Comcast to repair their own feed cable! What a rip off! I won't be a customer much longer!!
__label__1 My internet has been spotty for months. I returned the splitter, that did not work. I returned the Modem, that did not work either. Someone came out and look things over and made a few changes to my equipment, that didn't help either. The next guy they sent out climbed up the pole and discovered that I wasn't correct properly so he fixed that, which also did not help. So then they sent out another "contracted" person to rerun the cable from the box to my unit. Still didn't work, so I exchanged the modem again. I was attempting to follow the instructions to change my network name and password (which don't work) so I called tech support and the rudest guy I have ever spoken with in a customer service center helped me, but hung up before it was complete. I've about had it!
__label__1 Every 3 to 4 months my monthly rate would go up anywhere from $2 to $5+ for small items such as increased fees for tv services, modem rent or other "fees." Each time I would call and get the rate reduced after 30 minutes of discussion. This is in spite of a fixed price. 4 months ago I had the price reduced (again) because now AT&T is in my neighborhood. I was quoted a great price for the: Triple play". After 3 months the rate went up $5 due to various miscellaneous charges including an increase in the rental costs of the modems. Mine are nearly 4 years old. They could not explain why the cost on old equipment went up. I lost it and left! A human being shouldn't be forced to beg every 3 to 4 months. They are disgusting and I look forward to competition in that industry.
__label__1 We have been with Comcast for less than 6 months. 1st of all when setting up our cable & Internet & security system they sent an unprofessional individual who spent over 10 hours setting these services up in our home - very uncomfortable and so glad we had no plans to leave our home that day. Second of all we have had poor connection with the Internet since day 1. We called for a technician to come out and it took 1 week to send someone out... This is not our main complaint. Our main complaint is that the "technician" they sent out was another unprofessional employee who ended up running exposed wires from the middle of our cul de sac through our neighbors yard and our yard in order for us to have "working Internet". We were a little taken aback by this form of set up and asked when these exposed wires would be buried. The unprofessional "technician" then informed us he would submit for another technician to come out & bury the wires. After 2 business days we had not heard from any "follow up technician" and so on the 3rd business day after our Internet was "fixed" we called in to find out what was going on with burying the exposed wires. We spoke to a Wanda and were told that no one had submitted a "fix it ticket"! After explaining to her everything we had gone through, she then said that a technician would be calling us to come out soon. After waiting 2 more days from talking to Wanda we decided to call back and find out when this "technician" was scheduled to come out. We ended up speaking with a Mrs. ** who also told us that we still had no "fix it ticket" in the system!! She then heard the WHOLE story and told me that she would call me later that day (yesterday) and let me know who would be coming out but that I should have been told it would take 14 days to fix. I was like - "14 additional days... Cause it's already been 1 full week since these wires have been exposed"... So I never heard from Mrs. ** as she promised and I called in today and spoke with someone who told me they live in the Philippines and explained EVERYTHING yet AGAIN and long story short... My husband is on the phone STILL trying to get this resolved before September 12th as we were told today is when they are sending a "technician" out to bury our exposed wires. I am writing this because unfortunately Comcast is NOT WORTH USING! They have not apologized or resolved our issues!! We will be getting Apple TV & or Netflix after this! Please be warned... This is an unprofessional company that does not deserve our hard earned money or time!
__label__1 A month ago I talk to Apple at Comcast on how I can get all Disney channels. She tells me that I would have to upgrade my package to the Triple Play Starter. We spent over an hour by which she told me I needed a new modem as well. Ok, fine. I told her, by the end of the conversation, that I didn't have the channels I requested. She said I had to wait til I got my new modem and installed. Ok, got the modem, installed it, but still no Disney channels (which I was assured that my package included ALL Disney channels). I called again and spoke to George who said that it was an error on their part and he'll take care of it but give him 30 minutes. I gave him the whole day and no change. I then chatted with Korina yesterday who said she would take care of it. Oh, she did!!! She upgraded my package to the next level without my consent. All we wanted was one channel and to get that we have to pay $190 a month... Really?!
__label__0 A Comcast agent called me in December. He offered me the triple play--cable, phone service and internet for the price of $59.99 for the first 6 months. I accepted. When I received my first bill it was $203.00 dollars. I called them; they said they don't have that promotion, and I said well one of your agents called me. They offered me some free channels, that I am not at all interested in. They offered me for the same price, the phone service and internet services. Not the cable. I agreed, and guess what? My high bill came two days ago. I called them again, and the same thing happened--they don't have that promotion. They charged me $33 for each service plus the taxes. I am an old person, 60 years old, live on a fixed income. I cannot afford these mistakes from a company. Well, they said I have to pay. Would your company be able to help? Thanks for everything you can do. I paid them $100 for the first bill; now it's $142. If I don't pay, my phone service is going to be discontinue. I can not stay in my house without phone and internet service. I am a sick person, mentally and physically.
__label__1 Hidden Fees are everywhere. They are trained not to answer your questions regarding fees/credits/etc, it's ridiculous. I promise you will be sorry working with xfinity and comcast. Avoid them at all costs.
__label__1 We changed from a different provider to Comcast with the conditions that they were going to provide the similar features that make our company run smoothly. They promised everything, as well as a smooth transition for installation (we are in the middle of moving to a new location once the construction is finalized). However, since our move in Oct, we have had problems with our fax line (which I finally narrowed it down to pinpointing that the Comcast lines are digital, even though they say it's analog). It's a digital line that "technically has the same features as an analog line" (I have sporadic service where I cannot count on faxing, so I have changed to emailing everything).I have also been having problems with the internet, where we are constantly being kicked out of the programs that run online (OUTLOOK, something so basic that we rely on: emails). When the program is offline, I keep receiving pop-up messages in regards to enter my passwords, etc. because I keep being kicked out the programs. FINALLY BUT DEF not the LEAST, my phones have the worst service. Calls come in, we answer and no one can hear us, or other callers receive messages that our phones are disconnected, or they just cannot get through for whatever reason.HOW ARE WE SUPPOSE to run a business and provide the service when our lines for communication: OUR PHONES, FAX AND EMAILS have such unreliable service?? This has been the worst experience I've had to deal with trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are fixing the problem. NOW, they come around to tell me that other customers that have experienced the same issue has been resolved by upgrading to a different VOIP system. FIRST, I need to point out that I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE undergoing this situation. SECOND, I'm pretty much being bullied into changing the way my business works and runs so that I can keep them as providers... Why do they have it all backwards?? They are supposed to mold to our needs, and here I am being told that I need to change my phone systems, and pay more than I am doing so now so that I can make these problems go away.I am at breaking point where I'm researching to contact HELP ME HOWARD because their method of doing business is completely backwards. I keep getting the run around. Oh and I forgot to mention, in regards to the new location we are suppose to move to, we have been having to postpone the new installation due to delay with the construction. I keep receiving phone calls to notify that the installation is scheduled TOMORROW!! I've gone over this several times with our "customer rep" that is our direct contact through this process and it's still not getting cleared in the system. I feel like I would have to hire someone JUST to deal with Comcast because it's too time consuming to keep having to go over the same information again and again, as you would with children in a pre-k classroom. This is ridiculous.
__label__1 $1500 in installation fees. Waiting two weeks to get installation done and nothing but the runaround from you guys. I have got nothing but bad service from you and equipment failure over 6 times with my modem and business from your end.
__label__1 I moved 3 times and they hit me with a double bill every time. I called and complained and asked why I had to pay $400 every time I moved and was told because I get charged a month in advance. So I was charged 3 months in advanced on top of the actual month 3 times within a year and a half. The final time I moved, I cancelled my service and was told by the woman I'd be receiving an $80 credit for all those months in advance I was charged and those ** sent me a bill for $8.72 instead. T.V. mediocre, internet horrible, customer service horrendous!
__label__1 So I tried to hook my printer up to my network through the provided modem through Comcast. I called in last night to get the USB port on the back to have it enabled, which is what the chat rep told me to do. I spoke to 3 different agents, none of which spoke or even understood English. No matter how much I explained it to them they kept asking me if I was trying to hook my internet up through the USB. So at that point I was pretty pissed.The next day, today, I called in and got an agent who spoke and understood English, thank god. I was told that it would be an "easy fix" and they would transfer me to an Advanced Network Tech. I said OK and waited on hold for about 30 minutes. I got to the new tech and explained my issue and first off he laughed at me. Second he told me the USB ports on the back do not even work. Being mad that no one told me this before, I proceed to ask why they sell/rent them that way. He said it isn't something they care enough to fix and then said have fun and hung up on me.I have had nothing but problems with Comcast ever since I started using them in 2010. But the only reason I use them is I have to. They strong-arm everyone else that is decent out so they own the area. They outsource to people who do not speak or understand English when there are millions without jobs here in the US who have a firm grasp on the language. They do not care about their customers so much that they lie to them over and over and we have to deal with it because we have no other options because of their corrupt practices of getting others out of the area. This is why people want Google Fiber!
__label__0 I have cable TV with Comcast because it is the only cable TV company available at my location. I added 1 month free trial offer from Comcast for cable on computer and on telephone (AT&T). AT&T would not allow Comcast to install on telephone for which I am very happy. Comcast Cable never worked on my computer and only caused problems. I called and cancelled Comcast and they made an appt. to disconnect on Jan. 2, but they never showed up. I called Comcast to inquire and they reset the date for disconnect on 1/12. Meanwhile, I have received a billing in the amount of $70.00 which I will not pay. Telephoning Comcast now gets me put on hold and left there while they add up charges. I also hear 2-way conversations with Comcast employees while waiting and waiting for response.This experience with Comcast has been most upsetting and has caused me to get insomnia and headaches and elevated blood pressure. And online with AOL, I have very limited usage since I dont have a password (according to them) to be an administrator. I have used the same password for many years, but they say it is the wrong one and I can't use it. I am 81 years old and I consider this elderly abuse by Federal guidelines.
__label__1 Comcast sent me an ad in the mail and on my internet account page every month for 3 months asking me to come back to them while I was with DIRECTV. I had to drop DIRECTV cause I moved and decided to take Comcast on their offer. Offer was 99.99 a month for DVR service, 100Mb internet, HBO & Streampix and 225 channels. Seemed like a great offer. Called to set it up and told them I wanted it for a new address so they kicked me over to their Movers Edge dept. This is where it took a wrong turn. The lady on the phone was directing me through the process while I was looking at the services and fees on my computer on their website. She told me DVR service was included for free the first year but the bill would increase by 20 the second year for DVR service, I said no problem. I then asked if there was any other fees and the answer was no. I added the sports package at 9.99. I set up appt for install and proceeded to move.When I got to new home and expected Comcast to show up in the morning I got an email confirming my install for the next day, the day I was moving the whole day with a reserved U-Haul. I told them it was the wrong day. They told me there wasn't anything they could do cause that's the day I picked. I explained that I wouldn't pick an install day of the same time that I was picking up a truck to move. I cleared a day just for the install. I had to reschedule for after my move. Installer came and it was a joke. He refused to set up internet as I owned my own modem and he said it was against company policy for him to set it up or my modem would be his property in the system. The apartment was already wired for Comcast so TV install was connecting a wire to a box. Problem is he didn't have a DVR cause I ordered a HD box, or so his work order says. After he leaves I call Comcast and explain the situation. I tell them he refused to set up internet and they don't care, I'm still being charged full price for install 99.99. 100$ to connect an existing wire to a box that I didn't order. And if you go the way of the self install kit they still charge you 40$. I explain that my service was with DVR service. And surprise can't seem to find that ad I ordered anywhere on their website, imagine that. They insist it doesn't come with DVR service and that my problem is I talked to Movers Edge who only deal with existing service not new service. Even though I didn't call them they transferred me to them.Getting my first bill is another story. I wait for my bill, and wait and wait. No bill comes in the mail or to my email. Then a late bill notice pops up on my TV. I call them and ask where this bill is that I am late with. On their own website it doesn't list the bill anywhere, only an amount that I'm past due. No itemized bill unless I look on the TV. She tells me it was sent to my XFINITY email, "What XFINITY email?" I ask. "The one you get when you set up an account." A) Why would it not come to the email that my account is set up with or B) in the mail? Deceptive practices. When I see my first bill I notice the monthly payment is not 99.99 but instead 139.18. They charge me 10$ for HD technology, 10$ for the sports package I ordered, 5$ for internet blast fee plus taxes and fees. I call them up again and ask what the HD technology fee is for and they say that I have to pay extra for HD channels because the bulk of their customers still use standard definition. I have a hard time believing in this day and age that more people are still using a tube TV and standard definition over HD, which is only 720p anyway and not 1080p, so not true HD. Not to mention that since there is 4k that should be HD now, since that is the newest standard. I tell them I refuse to pay for HD service and I want out of my contract for their misleading ads. She insists there is nothing misleading, that I shouldn't be surprised by all the fees and taxes, that is normal for every company out there. Eventually I get her to send me a DVR box and waive the 20$ fee for a 10$ fee instead as HD comes with the DVR service. The 5$ (which is actually a 12$ fee with a 7$ discount) for internet is for the 100Mb internet even though the ad said it was for 100Mb internet. Confused? Some of the area in Twin Cities still only can get 50Mb internet so the parts that have been upgraded to 100Mb to replace the 50Mb have to pay a service fee for the upgraded speed. Only problem is, if I do a test on Speedtest it shows 59Mb download and 12Mb upload the exact same speed I got on my 50Mb connection before. Imagine that. They say it's because of the differences in technology and that my technology and building must interfere with getting a full signal. That seems convenient. Especially when I have a top of the line modem and router and a direct connection to the router not wireless.Do not believe in Comcast. They are deceptive and have no interest in keeping or earning your business because there is no competition. They have terrible customer service as they always have had. I will survive till my contract is up and then I will cut the cord and refuse to pay for 210 channels I don't watch. It's only 225 channels because that is the standard definition channels along with the HD channels. Comcast is a scam.
__label__1 What happen - this has been a nightmare for months. I am still waiting for reps to call me back. I have called over 25 times. Each time I call, no one sees my former complaint. I have to start all over again. No one ever calls me back. No one can ever help me. I have been getting charged for equipment and packages I did not ask for. I am owed Credits - and they refuse to give them to me. BEWARE AND DO NOT GET COMCAST. They lie to you!! They change your package without you knowing. Do not choose Comcast. You will need another job to pay for their service - they are thieves!! Customer service reps are trained to rip you off! They add to bill without your consent. They work off commission! Someone need to start a class action lawsuit!! I am owed hundreds of dollars for being lied to and charged for service I did not have. 
__label__1 I have had ongoing trouble with the phone service/internet/cable service. Technicians don't show up when they are supposed to. I get extremely long wait times when trying to get a manager to handle problems, which has been ongoing for months now. Technicians are telling me that the field equipment is old, and needs to be replaced, but every time a tech comes out, the parts are still old. They won't fix the hardware problems in the field.
__label__5 I obtained an internet and cable service from a national Comcast number. The operator was in NJ although I am in Miami. He promised me that the channel I requested which mostly are sports were in my package. When the service was installed, the contract I thought I secured no longer existed. Comcast added an extra $5 for a sports package and that the first operator told me that I did not need. In addition, the service was installed on 11/13. I received a first bill of $80.25 which is due on 12/04. Today, I received another bill of $81.92 due on 12/24 which is not even a month of service plus the amount on account that should be locked at 80 dollars. Maybe it will change again.
__label__0 My cable modem which I purchased from Insight Communications, the company Comcast took over from, stopped working. I had no way of knowing it was the modem because it was indicating as if it was trying to connect to the internet. A technician came and said that it was probably the modem. After buying a new one, all worked fine.Apparently, we were supposed to pay about $2 more per month for their "Wire Service Insurance" which makes no sense. It wasn't my fault the equipment stopped working. All, the technician did was test their cable system. Comcast, also jacked prices up. For a long while Insight prices were $40/month. It was so for a while as Comcast took over. Then they increased the prices in October to $42.95 without any reason for it.Now, they are jacking up prices again to $59.99 + ($1.99 for insurance) to some $60/month. That's a 50% price increase in less than a year and it is totally unfair and unreasonable. My main concern is with their shady practices, and not informing a customer about the service charge for anything. That's something I haven't agreed to.
__label__1 It is the worst Internet service ever. I saw another comment from someone in Evanston complaining about Comcast, and I could not agree more. Internet sporadically becomes unbearably slow, even as I am posting this it took three minutes to load. The reason I am posting is to make sure people understand Comcast is a terrible service, and will never compete with other providers like Roadrunner. Complete and utter disappointment, luckily I only need their service for a summer.
__label__0 I called Comcast to install an additional cable outlet into my parents bedroom because their TV in that room didn't work when digital was switched over. I came to their home three times from an hour away just to have them not call or show up. Finally, when they did come and complete the work, we were charged for two additional outlets and I was able to resolve that issue after two arguments that there weren't two put in. When I called to set up the first appointment to have the installation done, the man offered to get a free digital box. I questioned the free work and he told me we were paying already for that package and we could have the box free if we wanted. He encouraged, so I asked my mother and she said only if there was no additional charge. After receiving the box, they had constant problems with it. The cable company was saying it wasn't their equipment but it was my parent's TV. Finally, they sent someone out after they weren't sure what to do. The technician discovered it was the cable box and left a new one. A few days later, they again had the box fail and just said enough and they decided to drop the box off when they were near the cable company at their next doctor appointment. (It was more trouble than it was worth.) I received the bill twice now and was shocked to see all the charges. They were in fact charged for Broadcast HD from having the box that we were told was free and also were charged service charges of $36.99 each time they came out that we were never told would be a charge to send a technician for their faulty equipment. I have called and left a message with a manager since the lady on the phone refused to resolve this issue and also asked to speak with the original person that set up these appointments and told me the box was free. I haven't heard anything back and would like any information on how to resolve this issue. I am upset that they can do this to people and they surely get by with it because some people won't fight these issues.
__label__0 Back on March 15, 2010, I spoke to a CSR named Diana via the internet on Comcast's website to address the issue that Comcast sent me a letter threatening to disconnect my services. She was to have made a notation on my account that a payment would be made on my account on March 20, 2010 and there would be no disconnection. There was never no disruption in my services and they promised payment was made on said day in the amount of $50.I then received my bill (billing date 3/20/2010) with a late payment fee and a reconnection charge. I called Comcast on April 1, 2010 and spoke to a supervisor named Brandon and he claimed that my services were disconnected on March 20, 2010 and have not had service since said date. I told him that there was never a disruption in my service and that I wouldn't be talking to him because I have VOIP. I said that I would like the reconnection fee and late payment charge removed. He refused and still claims I have no service. I have documentation that they still bill me for services they claim are disconnected. I have a copy of the chat I had with CSR Diana on 03/15/2010 and I have a receipt of my payment for 03/20/2010.
__label__0 I encountered a Comcast RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP while I was having a problem with on demand freezing. After asking to speak to Katelyn's supervisor at 1:22 am, at 2:10am her supervisor Debbie tried to tell me not to base my one experience with Katelyn on Comcast. Katelyn IS a Comcast employee and Comcast employed Katelyn as a representative for their company. I feel foolish paying them for not only their barely-there cable service but for their shoddy DSL service that barely works. They take our money but won't respect us as consumers of their product.
__label__1 For the past two weeks, we have been getting texts saying there is an outage for internet in our area and horrible internet service because of it. When we try to call about it, the "customer relations morons" refuse to do anything more than simply record our complaint. When you ask for a supervisor, you get a corporate parrot that only knows how to recite policy and can't do anything more than squawk. At least a dozen phone calls over the past 24 hours and still no answers. Asked if they could at least send someone out to check on our lines and they said they can't send anyone because there's an outage. No kidding??? Even tried to contact the corporate office and they were worse. When you get upset, they tell you they're recording you like I care. I'm not getting paid to do a job. They are and they suck at it. It's high time someone breaks up the cable company monopolies!!
__label__0 I went to the Comcast store in Boca Raton, this morning. There were 50-60 mostly elderly people waiting to be seen by, usually, only 3 technicians in the heat. Each meeting took about 5-10 minutes so we are talking at least a 2-3 hour wait.It is no surprise that the snowbirds are back and Comcast knows this. Yet, they still have few technicians to help this group. How can they get away with this, and since, is it quite obvious that they have a relative monopoly in this area for something people want, how can they be held accountable to acceptable consumer standards?
__label__0 Every sunday the Fox News channel goes off the air or is srambled. This occurs every Sunday without fail. I believe an employee who works on Sunday's has an agenda.I pay $134.00 per month for Comcast. Unable to talk to anyone at Comcast about this. The FCC should investigate this problem.This is fraud, we  should certainly get  the channels we pay for.
__label__1 I have never received such horrific customer experience ever. After being a customer for over 2 years I noticed my bill increasing little by little. My bill started out at $119.00 and then the second year $139.00 and now $179.00. I called to inquire why my bill had increased since my contract was over. After being on hold numerous times for more than 20 minutes each and hung up on I opted to close my account. I would not recommend this service.
__label__5 Ongoing problems with hook-up, requiring 2 visits and continuing problems with playback and full usage of all x-box features, including audio or play for either recorded or on-demand programs. More significant, problems with playback of either previously recorded programs or the same program, which accessed after being unable to review what was recorded, or the same TV program available, per the Comcast box, on their own network recordings, which are not watchable due to problems with both sound and video "hiccups", or gaps.
__label__1 Comcast caused several issues for us that I think people should know about. (Long Time Customer) 1.) We called Comcast to come out to install coax cable in our dining room and living room. When the technician finally arrived, the technician ran the coax cable in loops over the siding instead of cutting and fitting the coax so it is hidden. Some of the TVs won't work unless you wiggle the coax. We called them to come back out to fix the coax and they told us that they would have to charge us $4-500.00 to fix these issues. After several hours on hold and calls to Comcast, Comcast customer service told us they would send out a technician to take a look at these issues. We scheduled a date and time for the technician to come out. The technician never showed up nor received a call from the technician 3 TIMES! We are currently fixing all of their mistakes. Absolutely ridiculous!2.) Needed to add a TiVo to our plan - TOOK 10 HOURS TO GET MY TIVO'S CABLE CARD CONNECTED! 2 WEEKS, EVERY DAY! TOOK SEVERAL CALLS TO FIND SOMEONE THAT KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING! Got placed on hold for several hours, was told my cable card was broken (LIES). If Comcast technical team didn't want to deal with me, they would hang up, put me on hold, or tell me to wait for 1 hour for the channels to come through. If they didn't know what they were doing, they would tell me that they needed to go talk to their team to get the card connected. Then after 10 to 15 minutes, they would come back and tell me to wait one hour. I did this process 4 times!Finally, I talked to a technician that knew what she was doing and sent the signal to my cable card and got the channels to come in while I was on the phone within a few seconds! Then I called the next day to tell them my On Demand freezes up. 3 hours on the phone and talked to 2 different technicians and they told me my card is broken again because they don't feel like fixing the issue. My cable card is brand new! The card works great and there is nothing wrong with my card! I could not believe it!I gave up at this point. The On Demand still will not work to this day. This was truly the worst experience I ever had and never would recommend Comcast. Comcast customer service and their technical team have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. They are rude, unknowledgeable, and extremely lazy. Comcast really has a lot of work to do. The faces of Comcast are making the entire company look bad and I don't think this is fair for the good staff of Comcast.
__label__5 My Internet service suffers from: shaping, speeds are shaped based on usage type; throttling, speeds are throttled per usage hours; monitoring, everywhere you browse, everything you download, everything you upload is logged on their servers; false advertising, speeds on the package and in speed tests come up the same and higher than what theyve listed for (I am now 18 Mbps down), but actual download speed when downloading anything is 1-2 Mbps.FCC has nailed them repeatedly on these and no change has happened. Random outrages that they don't even claim exist when you call them and insist on sending a technician out to check your system only to have the service back up in a few minutes or hours. A little insult here, I actually got to talk to a regional lead service technician and found out the "barn" doesn't even know when a field technician is working on a line and service is out, so their left hand doesn't know what their right hand is doing.
__label__5 In November of 2012 I stopped my service and moved to my home in Florida, which has Comcast. At that time, I was told my Michigan bill was paid in full. Comcast had been sending a small bill outstanding to an address in Mc Kinney Texas where I have never lived. After several months, they sent it to collections. (They admitted it was their mistake, and would notify the agency). I became aware of it in December of 2013 because it showed up as a collection on my credit report. (My credit score dropped from 830 to 773). Never had a collection in my life. I contacted Comcast and paid the $40 balance owing, and they assured me that they would have that report removed from my credit. As of February 24th, I am now receiving collections statements from Credit Protection Association LP in Dallas Texas sent to my old Michigan address. I spoke to them today and they said Comcast never contacted them to have this removed. Can you believe this, I am a Comcast customer in Florida as well. What the hell are they doing at Comcast? Has anyone else had this experience with Comcast? I am considering posting this all over the internet.
__label__0 Comcast has confirmed that the wiring to my house, a main line, is in need of repair and requires permits. In the mean time, I have four cable boxes; and on a daily basis, we have patchy screens or blue screens. The internet is out frequently too. They refuse to credit me anything on my bill until this is resolved. This is going on for years; and I am not the only one in our townhouse cluster.
__label__5 You need a category for dissatisfied and angry. We've been Comcast customers for 10+ years and in the last 3 years, the customer service has been ridiculous. The service is slower and more expensive. Now, after a tech was here to replace a modem that got damaged in a big storm, our service isn't working, the customer service to fix it worse. It disconnects time and time again - I am a working person. You know I don't have all day to get passed around from country to country finding someone to help me and then the end result being, "that is beyond our expertise, you need to pay $79 for someone to help you"! Comcast created the problem and now wants me to pay to fix it. They don't have any trouble contacting me to increase my service for a fee though.
__label__0 Comcast is extremely unreliable and unstable. I work from home so my work got me a Comcast business class cable connection. It is supposed to be fast and reliable, right? Wrong. First, it's slower than my consumer cable connection (also from Comcast, yeah, my mistake). On a good day, the business line is only maybe about half of the speed (according to speedtest.net)of the consumer line. Okay, so I don't have the fastest speed. No problem. At least make sure it's stable so I can do business, after all it is supposed to be "business class". I've had the connection for almost 3 months and in that time, I have experienced numerous service interruptions. Just last week, the connection went out for a whole day. I called Comcast 3 times and was told they experienced unscheduled service interruption in the area. I asked them when it can be restored? They said, "Don't know". I replied, Will someone come to look into it?,and the rep said, They are working on it, sir.The connection went out again yesterday at 9am. I called customer service and they had no idea what the problem was. They instructed me to restart then reset the modem. Twenty minutes later, the connection came back, everyone's happy, but not for long. This morning connection promptly went out at 9am again, and this time, it stayed out. I called Customer Service and they went through the same routine. Since this time, the connection didn't come back by itself, they told me a tech would come out in 4 hours to solve the problem. Four hours came and went, the tech never called or showed. I called back Comcast and was told they now found out it's another area-wide signal issue" And since they are fixing the problem, they didn't send a tech out.No phone call to let their customer know the tech is not coming either. Another 3-4 hrs later, the connection is finally restored, after the business hours had long ended. Well, silly me, I tried to log on and catch up on some work tonight. Guess what, the connection is gone again. I called Comcast and they blamed it squarely on the modem. It's connected 1 min and disconnect the next. I asked, Are you sure you guys don't have another signal issue in the area again? Because that's the same thing they had told me this morning until they found out the real problem", the rep said, "Nope. No issue with the signal.Well they promised another tech will show up tomorrow morning, but will he/she? That's anyone's guess. I had to borrow my wife's laptop and wireless card to write this complaint. My question is this - When business cannot operate because Comcast "business class connection" is unstable and unreliable, what responsibility does Comcast have? I for one was unable to do any work during the numerous and lengthy service interruptions, and I believe many more people are affected the same way. When I asked Comcast customer service this question, they told me, "Well sir, Comcast is already compensating you." I asked, "How?!"m and the reply was, "By having our technicians repairing the problem".But isn't it what Comcast supposed to do in the first place? Shouldn't Comcast be held responsible for its Business Class Internet Connection's failure, when it cause loss of business and work to people who had paid and subscribed them? Maybe a class action law suit is what's needed. Thanks for reading through my long post. If you have problems with Comcast Business Class Internet, let's hear it.
__label__0 Basically they charge for a service  which they can't provide. They have too many customers and this slows down the internet service in my area to speeds slower than dial up.This is worst from the time periods of 7PM to 12AM when internet usage is heavy. Six months ago I called for three months explaining what I was experiencing and what the problem was. I must have seen twenty technicians, told them the same story, not for three months did I finally get a call from a local manager asking me to please stop calling technicians, they were going to fix the problem. The problem was rectified when they split the node, the explanation I was given was that there was too many people on the node, something I had been saying for three months.I was credited for the internet time, but not the hours lost on the phone and time spent with technicians, which was well above ridiculous levels.Now, four months later, my service is awful again, for the same reasons, internet is too slow because too many people are on it. I called and am about to get the run around again.I'm fed up and I called and told a supervisor that if I wasn't treated right I will take legal action.
__label__1 After three days, I still have no service and have not seen any Comcast trucks in all of Montgomery County. The agents tell you nothing and the recorded message is full of lies. Comcast does indeed live up to their awful reputation as one of the worst companies in the US, second only to Pepco.
__label__1 I so hate this company. I only hope for AT&T get to my area to leave it for good. I am even considering to move out to an area with AT&T U-verse high speed internet. I used to have unlimited internet - now Comcast have limited to 300 gb and have trained their representative to lie about it saying that internet plans were always up to 300. I know is a lie because I've always used way more than that. I have subscription to Amazon Prime videos, Hulu and Netflix. I don't use their cable service because is awful. I can get almost as many channel with an antenna on my roof for free and in HD. Your basic cable plan should be called "blurred vision time or pay extra for the same." I only have a bundle package because they made me in order to pay less for the internet service (I didn't even unpacked the cable box) they are limiting the only thing I need from them which is the only good thing they have, and now they are messing up that too. The government should investigate this company for monopolizing the market and steal from their clients. The 300 gb limit is just another way to steal and rise the prices to make more profits. In my zip code is only Comcast so I think I'll have to move. By the way, their representatives suck. When they are caught in a lie they just keep saying it as if that were gonna make it true.
__label__0 Once again, Comcast has tampered with my service by rendering the remote Xfinity device frozen so that the TV is inoperable.  I can't even turn it on manually.  I called the government office of Cable Television.  I got no help.  I have now sent a letter to the mayor, as I am desperate for help.  Their excuse for banishment is that they are in "discussions" about which TV shows they deem "appropriate" for me to watch, and if it is "acceptable" to "allow me to watch TBN".  And yet, they have the unmitigated gall to demand payment and threaten to terminate my phone service to the ability I can't call 911 in case of an emergency.  I need an attorney pro bono.
__label__1 I have never written a bad review for a company before. However I feel I must share my frustration with Comcast. I have had Comcast service and every house that I have lived in since they started. You have to have cable to watch TV. However since I moved to my new home I have requested my bill to be sent to my personal email on several occasions. However they decided to set up an email for me and create a password for me. The man wrote it on a piece of paper when he came. Not even a whole piece of paper just a scrap piece of paper that you would throw away and left it on the kitchen counter. That was in May. I still have not received the bill and this is August. My services were shut off because I didn't pay the bill that I did not receive. I called customer service starting at 9 a.m. Still have not gotten anyone on the phone by 11:26 a.m.Finally since I was at work I stopped trying and called again when I got home. It took me another hour and 20 minutes to get someone on the phone who could not help me so I called back to ask for a supervisor. When I was told my package deal was for 149 a month but my bill is 297 a month because of service fees, taxes, and Equipment fees. So please tell me how is it that I pay more for renting equipment than I do for the actual service. Why should I have to pay for equipment rental when I'm already paying you monthly for services. Their math makes no sense too. Customer service is non-existent. Worst cable company ever. I have decided to go with another provider since Comcast has no idea what good customer service is.
__label__1 Salesman came to door, told him to let me call him next day after talking with wife about current company agreement. He agreed, gave me a business card with his cell # on it. I called him following day and said we have to wait 2 months but then I would try it. Salesman put the order in anyways and a box of equipment showed on my doorstep. I never opened anything, unwrapped, or untied any of the equipment. I check on my computer to see what it said, showed a new service bill of $122.00. I took off work early to take the equipment to the Xfinity store in colorado springs. The staff person said my account was cleared and Xfinity was about to do away with salespeople being paid regardless if the account was activated. 3 days later I checked online and this time it said I owed $23.00. So for a second time I had to go to the store, employee said he entered me a credit and quote "You shouldn't order anything from our door salespeople". Ok, so again for one, I never ordered it, and two, the staff comments and answers are plain ridiculous and insulting. Any plan or thoughts I might have had of signing up with this company in July are long gone. As far as I'm concerned they owe me money for wasted time talking to salesperson at my door and 2 trips to their store.
__label__0 I am very disgusted with the sound problem when watching videos. I get the volume set then when video is over, the commercial just blasts. I hurry to turn it down and have to turn up again when the next video comes on. When finished, the volume blasts again. The same thing happens over and over. What can be done? My speakers are not the problem. Any help would be appreciated.
__label__0 Over a period of at least six months, I continue to get charged for a service I never heard of and never requested. This service is called blast and a $10.00. Charge appears under the internet part of my bill. I have asked that this service be removed as not wanted and Comcast tells me they coded it off the bill and it appears again. Now I'm threatened with service shut off for this fictitious $10.00 charge. The state of New Jersey Consumer Affairs has been placed on notice and I informed Comcast of this as well.
__label__1 I attempted to cancel all services today and Comcast stated I had a binding contract with them via a phone call made in Dec. 2014. I said, "Well, since you record all conversations, could you please let me hear this phone conversation". They told me I would have to go down to 5330 South Robert Street in West St. Paul to listen to the verbal phone recording. I went down there and they stated they were unable to have me listen to this recording, but I could call billing department. I said, "Well previously this morning I spoke with billing, customer service and Loyalty dept." So they gave me a number and wanted to step aside and I informed them that no you will take care of me first. So I called the number and ** the supervisor tells me nicely to step aside and I say no nicely. The person on the other side tells me I have a binding contract. I said "ok let me listen to it." She comes back on the line and says that her team is listening it to it right now. Meanwhile I tell ** that he can talk to this gal. He informs me that he can't talk about my account because that is private. I said, "Excuse me but you are looking at my account so I'm sure you can talk with this gal on the other end **". I basically told ** I was not leaving until I received cancellation of service. So the employee then proceeds to tell me that I owe more money as in December my services went from $212.56 down to $199.32. So I owe the difference but she would cancel my service if I paid some $91.00 approx. I said, "Look you can't show me any proof that I had a contract and I am not paying you anymore. Please stop all service June 30, 2015. I don't want other aging persons to go what I have went thru to get service canceled." ** told me at one point that I could be sitting on my comfortable couch at home and disconnect services. I told ** I worked this morning at doing so and all I got was the runaround!
__label__0 My service price continues to change. It has run as high as $334 per month and as low as $100 per month. I ordered the triple play with free HBO in August of 2009 and have had to make 4 phone calls to have my bills corrected. Again I am being over charged! Can you please review this account? Today Clarisa at the Union office (she would not give me additional information) was unsure of why this has changed. She also could not make an adjustment to my account. There was no supervisor available and she assured me she would look into this matter. At least 3 hours on the phone.
__label__1 I have been using Comcast for more than 10 years. Their customer service has been getting worse and worse. Sometime in June 2012, I called Comcast and told them I would be moving from PA to MN. They told me I must disconnect my service in PA and then schedule a new service in MN. I told them to disconnect my service in PA on July 20, 2012. They disconnected my service on June 20, 2012. It took me a couple of days to clear that problem. Then they billed me on June 23 for $128.49, despite the fact that I already paid the bill in full ($68.55) on June 5th. After I paid another bill in full ($68.55) on July 6th, they billed me again on July 13 and then July 19 with a huge amount. When I talked to a Comcast agent (Sherry) to discontinue my service on July 20, she told me not to submit any payment after I paid the July bill. Unfortunately, Comcast charged me twice in July. When I talked to a supervisor, Leah, she said the information from Sherry was not correct. Without realizing that my bank had already paid $68.55 on July 5th, I made another payment ($59.49) on July 23, 2012. When I received my bank report and found I paid twice in July, I called Comcast about the payment. It took me almost an hour to reach a live person because I was transferred from one agent to another and then got disconnected. Supervisor Leah refused to give me a full refund for the second payment I made in July, saying that my service cut-off date was not July 22 but July 10, which is different from the information from agent Sherry. Comcast is a mess now. If you use their service, you will get ripped off, such as you will be charged twice within one month. So, please never, never use Comcast.
__label__0 We are retired community Chanteclair Villages and we have a contract with Comcast for the whole community. When we have problems, there is no way they answer their phones, call us back or give us adequate service.
__label__1 To say that I despise Comcast would be the biggest understatement I have ever made. This company who I actually liked at one time have been so completely worthless over the last 8 months yes 8 months trying to resolve multiple billing errors it is beyond belief and I will never give them a penny as long as I live. I ended my service last Aug. yet they continued to bill me thru Oct which I finally cut them off and blocked my credit card as well as reversed the charges. I made my first call about this error the first day I got the bill in Sept. 12 calls and 8 months later still no resolution. And get this they have now sent me to collections and it is showing up on my credit report. Each time on the call they begged forgiveness and promised that they would 100% take care of this. I have been promised this by a few of the following:Lucky 10-6-15. Zee 12-29-15. Karen 12-29-15 and she even gave me a confirmation # of ** that we were done. Ashley 12-30-16 finally I think it is done. Nope I then got my next collection notice on 1/20/16 but I am in Europe so I cant respond. Next I got to talk to 2-8-16 Jasmine. 2-8-16 Christine. 2-8-16 Joy who promised that Comcast would in fact call me back by end of business, of course that never happened. I just got back from a love trip to Europe and Asia and what do I find in my mailbox, another collection notice. So today 3-25-16 I talk to Pamala who transfers me to a supervisor Aaron. He informs me that they had made huge errors and they he will finally take care of it all. And oh by the way they still want me to pay $60.62 that they say should have been the final bill. So I asked him what the probably 20 hours of time I have spent on the phone is worth and he said "that is unfortunate but you had service and you owe Comcast." No apology just you owe Comcast. Then I asked about the credit reporting and he said that is automatic. We will see if anything actually happens. All I can say is that this company took a loyal customer and turned me into a zealot to tell every single person who will listen to never do business with them ever again. The fact that I am taking the time from my very busy day to write this would give you a clue how bad this entire mess has been. All I can say is NEVER EVER consider COMCAST for your cable. I got DirecTV at one of my houses and AT&T at the other and so far all is well.
__label__1 falsas promesas por comcast nos enganaron con el servicio solamente para que isieramos contrato con ellos
__label__0 I subscribed to their sevice to watch HBO fights and on a live fight with James Toney vs. Hasim Rachman me and my guests got to see the great introduction from Michael Buffer and then blank a screen. My brother tried to call this so called cable provider with promises that everything will be fixed in 3-5 minutes. Unfourtunatly the blank screen still appeared and silence and disapointment filled the air.
__label__1 I visited Xfinity's Office in Frederick MD on three occasion to resolve chronic service issues & Overcharges. Comcast keeps charging us $40 extra every other month!! On two visits with a staff member, we were assured the overcharge was erased. But it still goes on! Payment due dates was changed without notification which put us in the overdue category! Currently, the overcharge is $65! But Each time I attempt to log on to pay I was not blocked! I had to change my passport just about every other pay period. Today, I was blocked again from login on my comcast account! This is more than frustrating for a Senior with serious Health Issues. Last night I had to take ** to avoid A-Fib. Now we are getting calls from credit collectors! Very Abusive too.I am going to visit xfinity's office for the last time today. It sounds like another Class Action Lawsuit is a must. Further, we live in a neighborhood in which Fiber Optics were NOT extended to us like the new development across the street! Yet, comcast Charges us as if we have FIOS service! Fraud. This situation have not been remedied. Our Friends has higher level of service including HBO and they pay $65 month less than we do. This was brought to Comcast attention every service interruption.
__label__0 This is a copy of the email I sent to Comcast - using their email form."Upon agreement between myself and the customer representative that there was something wrong with the recording/playback part of the, We set up an appointment for today (Wed - 21 July) to replace the cable box. The tech brought a cable box that was rather beat up and an older model than the one I already have and he suggested I would be better off going to the walk-in station in North Scituate and getting one myself. He didn't offer to come back tomorrow with at least a matching cable box or better than the one being replaced.When I called Comcast after the tech left to explain that I was not satisfied with the way this was being handled, I was told that my service call had been listed as 'Canceled. ' I then asked if I could at least call the walk-in facility in North Scituate to be sure they had a unit available, she said that she couldn't give out that number (and that even she couldn't call this Comcast facility - it was against the rules).Is this the kind of treatment a customer should expect for the $150+ I pay every month for the three services I subscribe to from Comcast.? "
__label__1 I ordered the X1 package online then had it tweaked over the phone after speaking with one of the Comcast CSRs. It was installed 6/12/15. The installation was seamless and the tech was awesome. I was not given any paperwork other than a remote instruction manual. I read it. I still had questions about my service. Call #1 was at 11:15P EDT. I spoke with a man who couldn't find my account and transferred me to a "X1" support rep. This was a female. After about 5 minutes of authentication and trying to find who I was, she was able to answer some questions. She kept placing me on hold or something, not sure if she was in training. Doesn't matter... after about 5 minutes of questions the line went silent. I stayed on for a few minutes and dead air... nothing. It disconnected after about 3 minutes of this. Call duration was 20 minutes. I called back at 11:36P EDT. This time I somehow routed my way to being on hold. Music playing. I sat on hold for 15 minutes according to my call log. Call DISCONNECTED and I never spoke with a human. I called back for the third time and they were closed. Once this happened, I did some research online on the best way to get assistance. I searched Google for 'Email Addresses For Comcast Executives' and found a list of email addresses on Consumerist.com. I then proceeded to file a BBB complaint. Once the complaint was filed, I referenced the number in a scathing email to the executives and sent it out. Their executive relations team contacted me and the tech manager for my area showed up at my door the very next day with his contact info and cell number on the back of his card. The ONLY thing these conglomerates understand are complaints lodged with third parties (BBB, FCC, Attorney General in your state) and when their executives are emailed directly.
__label__0 I didn't know my mother owed a bill to Comcast. So when I moved and I established cable through Comcast, they wanted me to send my lease. Well, my mothers name is on the lease also, so they turned my service off and charged her past bill under my name. I'm just 18 years old and just establishing credit. How can they charge me for my mothers bill? Now I'm stuck with a $1700.00 cable bill. I was going to pay my first months bill and they cut my service all and billed a $1700.00 bill. Please give me answers a.s.a.p. Can they do this? Is this legal?
__label__1 Comcast please do a better job at training your representatives. Your reps are usually rude, difficult to communicate with, and not willing to help 100%. Not only poor customer service, but I always get disconnected on the phone and cannot get another rep on the phone in a timely manner.
__label__1 Can I score them lower than 1? I have never experienced such poor customer service and lack of care, how bad they are. I had Comcast many years ago and wound up canceling and going without cable for almost 3 years. Finally, AT&T came into our area and they were great. We have now moved to an area that doesn't have AT&T and figured that surely Comcast has gotten their act together, so I would try them again. I should have stuck a sharp object in my eye instead. There have been too many issues to list here, so I will just give you a few. It started with them telling me that my new residence had their service before so it is already wired and they would send me the necessary items to basically plug in and go. It turns out that was not correct and after several frustrating hours of trying to figure out what I was doing incorrectly, I called them up to come out. It turned out the house was wired for satellite. They charged me a heavy charge for a service call and the service still didn't work correctly. They came out and did an outside check and said that was fine. I had to call again. The second serviceman said the previous one didn't know what he was talking about and he addressed one issue that helped my service. While all this is going on I experienced horrible people and long wait times from their call centers, some not in US. The reason I am on hold now is because they decided to start charging me for a DVR that I do not have. Shouldn't they know I do not have this since it is THEIR equipment??!!!?!?! My wait time is over 2 hours and 30 minutes now. I am afraid to hang up because before this call, I was hung up on once before I got to a person, got a busy signal, went through prompts and then got sent to a busy signal, etc. and the list goes on. I am pretty sure I will be cable free here soon. Thank goodness for Roku.
__label__1 All I can say is that they will jerk you around and lie about pricing. They should be driven out of business the way they treat paying customers. They will waste so much of your time.
__label__1 I don't use Comcast's Cable TV services because of the constant problems, but have had good wireless internet connectivity until a few weeks ago. Endless menus and waits to speak with customer support people who then follow long troubleshooting protocols that had tried many times, ultimately ending in transfer to wireless support. Although usually these people are usually neutral-to-pleasant, and I've been speaking with tech support people for roughly 18 years without problems, I got a hold of an obnoxious, patronizing, offensive wireless tech support person today. Of course, Comcast pays a lot of lip service to wanting to provide customer support, but it took another half-hour to get through their phone system again and to be connected with a series of supervisors simply to report this kind of treatment. Comcast is a massive monopoly and it appears that if we want service, this is what we can expect to have to deal with.
__label__0 We canceled our service with Comcast on September 17, 2007.  On September 28, 2007 we received a statement billing us for 10/1 to 10/31/07 for $111.27.  I called Comcast and was told that our account was canceled, were due a credit of approximately $22.00, and the bill generated by mistake.  On October 29, 2007 we received yet another bill from Comcast for $215.40 to include October and November 2007.  I once again called and was informed even though the bill was generated we do not owe, and that a Comcast Technician needed access to my fenced in backyard to do a lock out to completely disconnect the service. I had never been told that until a technician was able to access my fenced backyard I would continue to receive these statements.  I must be home and wait on the technician for 11 hours to lock out service that I cancelled almost 2 months ago.  I am extremely disgusted with Comcast and the way they have completely mishandled this.  The outstanding balance could cause us a credit problem.
__label__1 Call Comcast on 01/23/2016 to report a problem with my services, scheduled a service appointment for the following day 01/24/16 Between 9 am and 11 am. No one show. Is a horrible customer services. They don't care. They say that someone will you call back. Nobody calls back. They overcharge for the service. Shame on this company.
__label__1 Comcast has the worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with... I upgraded my package.. They were supposed to come out today and install my new boxes... I called twice this morning to give them and confirm my cell # as I was at work.. Comcast promised on both occasions when I called this morning that the tech would call me on my cell to let me know he was on the way so I could meet him there.... I waited the entire two hour window for the tech to call me. When I decided to call to see where the text was, I was told by Comcast they text called my home # knocked on the door and then left.... I clearly told Comcast on two different phone calls this morning to have the tech contact me on my cell when he was en route??? All they could do for me is just reschedule??? Worst customer service ever!!!
__label__0 We have had Comcast for several years and it has slowly gotten worse. We have the televison,internet and phone service through them. When ever it rains even a sprinkle, all three services go out. On the 13th of the this month they sent out a tech who told me my problem was not in the house but on the box outside. He said squirrels could have gotten into it. He told me someone else would need to come over for that. I ended up having to hire someone to work for me at my shop that day just to be told he was not the one who needed to be sent out.  I asked him if I  needed to be here for the tech outside and he said no. Yesterday and today my entire service was out again from the rain and they said they had repaired that problem on the 15th. I told them I was having the same problem and wanted new service equipment run or I would be cancelling their service. They were suppose to be here between 11-2 and it is 4:06 no show.Other people that I have spoken to that have Comcast do not have this problem. They say they have pixeling, but they have not lost servive as much as I do. There is no problem when the sun is shining. I have paid for service that I am not getting. I keep track of non-service only to be told that unless I report it I cannot have it deducted. I can't report it when I do not have phone service. I have had to pay some one to work for me at my business to be home.
__label__1 The Wifi is going back to dial up - call customer service - not only do they have no idea on the service but barely speak English - definitely call center is NOT in the United States. Frontier was 150 percent better. They sell you a faster wifi service but the signal is NOT there. I want to cancel but now I'm locked in by contract!
__label__1 Consolidated my business utilities for convenience and less money (so I thought). Signed contract on 10-3-14. No service from them until 12-18-14. Rep said had a lot of problems with other customers. When reps came to switch service they were asking me where certain wires were and things that I didn't even know what they were talking about. This lasted for about a week of them sporadically coming and going. Then the nightmares really started. My credit card machine started to be very slow or not work at all. I called Comcast. Reps did not show up were scheduled, and then blamed my CC company and the CC card company blamed Comcast. This went on for months. Then the CC would not batch out at night so my sales were not credited. I spent so much time on the phone with Comcast one day I just broke down and cried to the woman on the other end of the phone. Ten days ago I lost all internet/WiFi connection. Called Comcast Thursday, March 19th, was told Rep would be there tomorrow, Friday 20 March. They called that day to confirm... no one showed up or called. Called them again and a rep finally showed up today, March 26th and "fixed" the problem, which was caused by "a lot of problems" with the "boxes"!?!? Finally got a rep on 3-30 to "fix" the problems. I plan to go back to Centurylink as soon as possible. My contract says nothing about early termination fees, and even so I will tell them to take me to court. I doubt any court would award them anything with such abominable and shoddy business practices. The FCC should be made aware of all these complaints and either fine them or shut these shysters down!
__label__0 I have not had On Demand since I started service on June 3rd, 2008. I have reported this several times and two technicians have come to my house to repair the problem.  No one at Comcast can find out what is wrong!  Today is Sept. 11, 2008 and I still do not have On Demand, but I am being charged for this service.  I have been told by rep's at Comcast that they are working on the problem, with no date as to when it will be repaired.  I am very upset with the lack of service that I have received from Comcast and resolution for this.
__label__1 When I hired the service, they charge me for the technician coming to install the service. When I moved, they send another technician to install the equipment. He came 5 hours late and did EVERYTHING wrong. I started having troubles with the phone line, then the internet connection and the TV. After 1000 calls to tech support and a lot of incompetence, they send another technician to fix the problem. It turned out that the problem was the first technician that made everything wrong. But the worst part is that they charge me for the second technician that came to fix the work of the first one. When I called to ask for my money back their answer was that I didn't hired an insurance to cover that. WHAT!!!! I have no idea, you have to buy and insurance to fix others mistakes. I had understood it was the opposite, isn't it.
__label__0 We have had problems with the cable television.  We have not been able to watch, mainly during prime time, due to digital blocking, screeching, sticking, burping, etc. We began making phone calls in April 2008 and Comcast sent guys out who didn't have a clue.  Because it occurs during prime time, cable guys don't work prime time, the problem was never happening. They said our signal was strong, it wasn't in our yard, and it wasn't on the main line.  I made repeated calls and the customer service reps kept circling me through the same redundant process.  I would ask to speak to supervisors and was denied.  Then I began getting billed for the cable guys to come out do the same tests and come to the same conclusions as the others.  I called and spoke to Brenda, supervisor, in billing who assured me that I would receive credit for my interrupted television as soon as they, Comcast, determined the problem and remedied it.  I had been calling since April this call occurred on 5/30.  That meant that as long as Comcast didn't fix my cable I still had to pay for it and I would not receive a credit until they fixed it.  On the phone again, this time two phones at a time, one to complain about the problem, and assure the rep he couldn't help me, I needed a supervisor, and one phone to complain about the representative I was speaking to who wouldn't help me.  Some how I made it to another manager, Joe, who assured me that with in 72 hours all would be fixed and credit to my account would me made.  Not so.  I began my two fisted phone calls for the next three days and on Saturday, 6/8 an expeditor cable tech showed up and ran the problem all the way back to the main hub in Alvin, which is what I kept telling the customer service reps.  This guy did finally show up and fix the problem.  I now should get my credit of mid April to mid June. NO.  I call again.   This time Jennifer refuses to let me speak to a supervisor although she can't possibly give me a credit.  I insisted and insisted and finally she said that  Michael would look into my case and call me back.  When I had not heard from him I called and again, no such person.  I was told at one point that because I didn't call everyday I was was only granted two days of credit in April. Comcast says we owe $301.00 for 2 months of them not delivering service to our home.  We pay $120/month for cable, plus service calls that had nothing to do with our television of $26 each call.  They owe us a minimum of $270.  We owe $31, but comcast doesn't agree.
__label__1 I had just a terrible experience with Comcast tonight, and I want to share it so others hopefully avoid the same mistake. Comcast has utterly terrible customer service. I've been through this with them before, and foolishly went with them again when I moved to my last house (7 years ago). It's tough when there's not many options to choose from. But anyway, I moved out of that house recently, and called to cancel my service. My contract had long ago expired (I think it was a 2 year contract originally), so I figured, no worries, right? No early termination penalties to pay. I called to cancel and they said that my contract "auto-renewed", and that I have to give them 60-days notice to cancel. So they could cancel it, but I will be billed still for the next two months. So almost $200 down the toilet, just paying them for nothing. It's outrageous and I am so angry! I asked to speak to a supervisor and she said that I couldn't speak to a supervisor about this. After I kept trying, she said they just don't have supervisors readily available for such calls.Huh? A big call center, national company, and no supervisors available? Or do they just get so many complaints about this horrible policy that they've decided to not transfer people like me to the supervisor, so it doesn't tie up their time? Finally after lots of back and forth, she said she would have a supervisor call me within 72 hours, but that it wouldn't change anything and I was going to be charged for two more months. I got on their website to e-mail a complaint to management. No e-mail address available for customer service. Seriously? I tried to create an account so I could post a message on their forums. Couldn't do it. It's like they intentionally make it difficult to file a complaint or speak to a supervisor, so they can just be blissfully unaware of when they have an angry customer (which seems to be often, from the many many angry and frustrated reviews I've read online tonight).I really don't get it. I'm in my thirties, I have (hopefully!) many years left, years in which I will need internet, TV, and phone. Why would they alienate a long-time customer to enforce crazy policies and make a few more bucks in the short-term? They're going to get 2 more months of pay from me (if I even decide to pay the bill, which I may not), and then I will forever go with other companies. How does that make sense?Bottom line, I will never go with Comcast again, and I would encourage everyone else to steer far away as well. I also think we all need to push for competition, either from city or state run systems, or more small businesses that offer this service. Comcast has essentially a monopoly in my old neighborhood, there's just not many options. Thankfully in my new neighborhood I was able to go with another provider. But there needs to be more options out there so Comcast actually takes complaints seriously, rather than just being smug about the fact that they can do whatever they want to customers, who have to deal with it if they want internet, TV, or phone service. I'm in customer service myself, and I am not okay with how they treat people. If I treated my customers like this, my company would go out of business. Comcast needs that kind of pressure on them too, to be more inclined to do the right thing.
__label__1 Comcast SERVICE is atrocious. They raise prices monthly. I have been a customer for 10 years and I have to wait 3 weeks for service? I broke my pelvis and asked Comcast to deliver an HD box and install it so I can watch TV downstairs since I can't walk upstairs. I am flat on my back. Multiple calls got me nowhere. They cannot come until 3 weeks. What is wrong with them? They suck all this money off their customers and when I ask for 1 service, which I have to pay for they give me an appointment 3 weeks later. All begging and asking resulted in nothing.Their internet services is flawed. They charge for tiny boxes I received 10 years ago monthly 9.95. So I like to get tv downstairs because I am in a wheelchair and can't go upstairs and voila I have to wait 3 weeks. THIS IS UNHEARD OF. They are monopolizing the market and therefore don't care for real customer service. It's totally not fair. They moved it to the 28th of June, 11 days from now. Why can't they offer a simple service to a customer who really is just laying there and unable to go to a store and get the box?
__label__1 After 12 years with AT&T DSL, my neighbor recommended Xfinity Blast. So I called the first phone # I found for Comcast. I was offered a promotional offer for Blast Internet with unlimited nationwide phone for 49.95 a month. I agreed to the bundled package while writing down the details on paper so I know what I signed up for. The installation charge would be 49.95 also, I clearly remember (and wrote down on paper) that both numbers matched, monthly charge and install, both 49.95. The week after the install, a bill came for the wrong amount. After several attempts to rectify the matter by phone, I was told that the promotion does not exist. On top of that, I didn't even have Blast internet, which I specifically requested based on my neighbor's recommendation. I feel I was blatantly misled to sign up for a lesser package at a higher price than quoted.
__label__1 Before I complain about the Comcast internet service, I have to mention this. I am a Korean and had the fastest internet service in my country with low monthly payment. AND there is no limitation for the usage. Yesterday night, one message was popped up on my computer. It said my data usage reached almost 90% of my plan. I was shocked and angry. Data usage limitation? I haven't heard about that before. So I called Comcast internet customer service. The customer representative said there is no data usage limitation on internet. She added that if the message keep popping up then contact Comcast internet security service. All of sudden, she said since I have been their customer almost 9 years she recommended to change the service program, as a bundle of internet and cable TV for $59. It was attractive but I said I was OK with my program now. But she kept pushing me to have the new bundle. So I said since I was not sure if I stayed in the same place in next year, I did not like to have one. But she said there should be no early termination and even if so they could handle it. I didn't and don't believe her words. But that was not an issue. So, in this morning, I felt uncomfortable about the message again, and called Comcast again. I asked about the data cap and the customer service representative said there is none. So I talked about the message but she said there is no data limitation for home internet service. I asked her to transfer my call to her manager. Then, she transferred my call to security department! The security department guy said they could not help me because I am not the account holder. I explained that I was calling for my wife and I am the one who pay the monthly payment. Then they explained me that there IS data cap/limitation. What a bummer... I argued that I did not sign on the contract under data limitation. He said it was implemented. So I argued that the Comcast only shows customer two different speed internet service without explaining data cap. And he said normal speed internet has cap of 250 GB and high-speed internet was 350 GB limitation. I haven't hear of that. I quickly searched about that while I was on the phone and found only a handful cities in the U.S. have the cap, and Tucson AZ is one of them. That guy explained me that since I normally used under 300 GB except only one month I did not have to worry about the data cap and if I use more than that, they are going to charge 50 GB for $10 more.I argued that I had no memory to read that policy through their official letter and I had no reason to agree with the data cap because I signed the contract back in 2006. And I asked him whether there was another choice or different program. He said he could transfer my call to their sales department. But he transferred me to data usage department. I had to explain the same subject over and over again. The technician did not know what to do with my question. He did not even know there is a limitation. He said he could check the internet connection. So I said I was not talking about internet connection. Then he transferred my call to sales department. The sales department guy said there is no limitation again! And all of sudden she said there is. I told her I did not like to have limitation on internet usage. She said then I have to choose $350 internet service. And she added that was the only option, otherwise I have to pay $78 per month plus over usage fee for every 50 GB with $10. I just wasted my 2 and half hours with useless call and customer service. There was no way I could get help from them. Like you see, half of them didn't know their internet service has data usage limitation. Other half did know but couldn't handle my complaint. I did not sign up for the stupid internet data cap. If that service is like other mobile phone service, I cannot help accepting it (Verizon forced me to resign contract from unlimited data plan to 7 GB limited data family plan. Otherwise I could not change my broken Samsung smartphone) BUT, the home internet service is supposed to be unlimited. Internet itself is democratic and the providers are not.One comment the security department guy told me was like this, "There is a limitation, but even if there is, we do not disconnect your internet service. However the fee on your billing reflects the usage, 50 GB for $10. That's why the customer representative said there is no limitation." For my entire life I haven't heard that kind of logic. Only word I can think of the event is GREEDY BASTARD. I like to join a class action if there is active one now.
__label__1 I am a senior on SS disability and reside in Pine Ridge condos for four years. Since Xfinity merged or bought Comcast, I have had a "nightmare" over here. I have had at least seven service technicians come to the house to fix or try to fix my problems. Shows do not tape through my cable box, which was replaced. Shows are cut short and I have had no volume as well.
__label__1 Refuse to honor contract. It's been going on two years, still having problems. They try to do the bait and switch game. Who can I contact to help me. Thank you.
__label__1 Well on September 1, 2011, I ordered Comcast cable. Only supposed to be for 2 months as I told the sales representative. He said, "oh well, if you join your internet service and TV it will only cost an additional 29.99 a month". I said, "Ok, cool. Can I get it overnight?". He said, "no problem". I told him Friday I have work at noon. He said, "That's no problem. It will be there around 9:30am to 11:00am". Ok, I said. Friday came and left. No phone call like I asked when they get to my residence since it's gated. So Saturday, I called to see what had happened. Well the guy in Mexico assured me that a UPS guy tried to get in contact. That they were at my residence, knocked on my door and no one answered. I said ** because I was there and they can't get in. So I asked for the package number to track. He read it to me, I read it back to verify it's right. I said thanks and hang up. I called UPS to my surprise, there is no product number or no package scheduled to be delivered. So I called back another person from Mexico, this one's a lady. So I explained and she said it was returned to Comcast and it was never attempted to be delivered to my residence. So I said, since you failed you can fix this, take off the 25.00 overnight charge and have someone deliver it to me. I cannot do that, I can do another overnight shipping but it won't come until Tuesday since Monday is a holiday. I will also give you a blast on your internet for three months free she said. Cool, I said. So Tuesday came. I checked emails and I have three hundred dollar bill from Sep. 1st to the 3rd. ** is this? I called Comcast again and same old runaround. After the third person, I came to find out a few things.5. They actually had the balls to say "we'll see if we can take this off". I lost it after that. Lying, thieves, no principles at all.
__label__1 The very first time, when I moved to new apartment, I scheduled an appointment and they came 2 hr after the scheduled time. Then they fixed a router that was dropping wifi connection all the time, and later turned out to be faulty (there was also numerous references online about the issue with that model). I scheduled another appointment, as I was not able to use it coz of Comcast issue. But they charged me like some $100. Later when I called customer care and complained, they waived that off. After replacing the equipment in the second visit, it went fine for some time. Then new issue popped up - very frequent loss of connection and the router was going offline. Troubleshooted with remote support for more than 20 times. Their remote support is the most worthless support I have seen from many service providers. Only thing they can do is remote restart and finally asking us to manually reset the router. Two times, onsite technician came and fixed some issue with their outside switches and boxes, and it started working fine for few months. Then issue resurface again. Only thing I continue with Comcast is there is no other real alternative.
__label__1 I haven't been a Comcast customer for a long time, but they have persisted for about five years now in sending me a mysterious bill for $165 that can't be explained. I've repeatedly asked for an itemized breakdown of the charges, only to be told "our computer records don't go back that far." They've sent it to collections twice in the past, only to have the collections agency send it BACK to them after I successfully disputed the charges. Today I received a call from a THIRD collection agency about the same bill. I have, again, disputed the charges and explained the situation. And, again, I have an official dispute form being mailed to me to fill out and send to Comcast via certified mail. I am sick and tired of this, and am interested in escalating my complaint to the Better Business Bureau, the Attorney General of WA, or the FCC.
__label__1 So my husband and I first got Comcast at our place in Fort Wayne. We got a TV and Internet bundle with X1 and we liked it well enough. We did the self install because we didn't want to pay extra for install and I'm pretty good with these sort of things and it was working soon with no issues. Our only problem was that when we moved, we called, asked for service to be cut off on a very specific date because we wanted our Internet until the day we left. I turned in the cable box (we had our own modem that we didn't need to turn in) four days early and they ended up terminating our service automatically on that day without any notification. Not the biggest deal but not good customer service to be sure.Fast forward to our move back to CA. We didn't really want to go with Comcast again but unfortunately they were one of the only service providers of high speed Internet at our rental. So we called and got a lady with a very heavy Indian accent in a very loud call center who could barely hear us and had to ask for our information several times. She stuck to her script and kept trying to sell us the same deal which was way more than we wanted. It was so frustrating to get her to understand or answer any of our questions so I just hung up.My husband called later again that day and of course he got a nice guy who sounded like he was from Ohio. They talked for a bit and decided on a internet and TV with X1 deal. So a couple days later our stuff arrives and I get it set up and ready to go for activation. Already I see they gave us a regular cable box and not the X1 which I was familiar with because we had it before. So I call and try to activate. They activate the cable box but not the Internet. We don't have any Internet signal or cable signal to the TV even after activation. I go around to all the different cable outlets in my house to see if my modem can pick up a signal anywhere and it can't. So later that day I call again and schedule for a tech to come out and take a look at the wiring.The lady tells us that a tech will come the following Friday at 8:15 with a window up till 10am. Okay great. I ask what it will cost and she says generally installation costs $50 but if it's a problem with the Comcast side of the system, it will be free. She also told me that any visit within 30 days of signing up will be automatically coded as an installation. This bit of information turned out to be such a hassle because after that, everytime I called back, they wanted to talk about my installation instead of the fact that I was fully installed but had no cable service what so ever. My husband gets home later and I tell him about how they sent us the wrong cable box. He really doesn't like that so he calls and get transferred four times because no one knows what's going on.He eventually gets a fifth gut that helps him and he asks what it would be to "upgrade" to X1 and, surprise, it doesn't cost anything because that's what we were supposed to have in the first place. This particular guy seemed pretty helpful but not so much in the end. He confirms our Friday appointment and leaves two notes on the work order, one, that the tech is supposed to leave an X1 box and remote with us, and two, if they charge us for the visit, he will remove the charge from our account. So at that point we were somewhat appeased.Fast forward to Friday when our appointment is supposed to happen. 8:15 comes and goes, okay cable guys are usually late. 10am comes and goes. So I call at around 10:30 to check on the status of the tech. Some girl asks me for all my account information, sees that I had an appointment scheduled and then puts me on hold to go "check" on the tech's status. I'm on hold for a few minutes and then all of the sudden a completely different guy answers the phone with no information about why I called so I have to do the whole process over again. He puts me on hold to go check on it for me and this time he is on the line again after a few minutes. He sounds very confused and says something was wrong with my work order and the system automatically canceled the appointment.Of course the system didn't call to inform me of this information. I rescheduled an appointment with him for the next Tuesday at 4 pm which he confirmed with me a few times on the phone. I was pretty upset at this point so I called my husband and told him, and he said to call back and cancel our order and just do a minimal Internet deal instead. So I called back and talked to someone and asked for the $20 they promise to customers. He put me on hold for a bit then came back on and that billing had given me the $20 credit and I could view it online as well. I then tried to confirm my appointment for the following Tuesday with him because I wanted to be sure it was still in place even though I was changing my order. He then told me my appointment was on Wednesday at 10 not Tuesday at 4.I had no idea why it magically changed within 20 minutes and I tried to clarify with the guy, but he had a thick accent and barely understood me anyway, so I gave up. Later that night my husband called to cancel our order and just get Internet. They gave him the run around, transferred him to three different people, claimed we had no $20 credit on record and then proceeded to tell us after canceling that a smaller Internet package was going to cost us more than our original deal because we were no longer "new" customers in the area. And this was before we had any service and before our billing period had even started.So my husband told them that this was the worst service he'd ever had and we were never going to be Comcast customers again. We canceled our order completely and we just have to return the cable box. We are currently getting slower Internet from a local company for a decent price and they have excellent service and we are relieved we don't have to deal with this awful company anymore!
__label__1 We put a new TV in the kids room and from there it all went downhill. For whatever reason, I can no longer access the Xfinity wifi spots. After 3 calls to Comcast, they assign me a ticket number. One idiot told me that I need to use the master account name and number which is BS as I was always able to sign on with any of my accounts. Now I cannot access Xfinity wifi with any accounts. I get a screen that says I do not have the proper "internet tier", however I have the fastest tier and this never changed. Hate Comcast, HATE THEM!
__label__0 we ordered comcast for three rooms an only two has all the chanels. one room doesnt have all the chanels. i dont under stand it. we ordered all the chanels that was required. why hasnt anyone came out to fix this problem, they say we have to pay another 19.95 for them to come out to fix this problem. should of program all the chanels in when supposed to of did it in the first place. we paided our bill and noone came out yet. noone has talk to us about it just gave us a runaround. telling us you have to pay. why shoud we pay  
__label__0 Back on April 13, 2010, I spoke to Michael in customer service regarding my Comcast cable bill. I noticed that it appeared I was paying for three cable boxes when in reality I only had two on hand.  I was told that yes, I was being charged for three. When I told him that I returned our third box months ago, he said it didn't show anything in their system. He would put a ticket in and someone would get back to me within 24 to 48 hours.On July 27, they finally returned my call and said they couldn't find the box, that I would have to find the receipt. I referred to two different receipts that I had and they are saying neither is the correct one. I told them that they should be able to check the date. After I returned the box in the Livermore, CA location on First Street, the woman helped me lower my monthly bill with a new plan going from $220+ / month to approximately $160 + tax.  I was told on July 27 that they couldn't see back that far, that their system only goes back one year. My bill in June 2009 was for $224.09 and in July 2009, it went down to $177.74. I again asked, "Can't you look between May and July of last year?" "No, I'm sorry, our system doesn't go back that far.  I was told again I would need to find the receipt or I'd have to pay for the missing box.A few weeks later I received a letter dated August 12, 2010, saying a bill would be coming if I could not produce the receipt proving I turned the box in.  I called customer service again on 8/26 and was told again that someone would get back to me.  I asked for the same lady that I spoke to back on 7/27, but was told he couldn't see that information in the Comcast system. I was given the reference no. ** and was told I would hear back from someone within 4-7 business days. On my 9/2/10 bill, I was charged $310 for this box that still to date (10/19/10), no one has gotten back to me since the 8/26 call.How am I expected to prove that the receipts I have are not correct when those are what were given to me? I didn't notice at first that I was still being charged because my bill dramatically decreased soon after I returned the box. Comcast doesn't appear to be able to help, or is unwilling because their systems aren't capable of looking back more than 12 months. If they cannot look back this far, maybe that's why you cannot see the box? Now I'm being charged for a box I do not have, nor used, and on top of everything being charged for the usage of it, all the while I've been telling Comcast I don't have the box.  Can someone please get back to me so we can resolve this issue?

We called a few days later to check up on the install time/Date and make sure everything was on track. We found out that Cable internet would not be available in our area and the modem order could not be canceled at that time. But were told to send the Modem back with the installer. Easy enough.
On the day of the install, My wife was home. The installer did a crap job and even cut out some of the maintenance loops left by our satellite installer. Complaining that our install was too complex he left a coax cable running the length of my living room. The installer took the modem(this becomes part of the issue) and lets us know that we should follow up with ComCast if we did not get a credit within 10 days.I get home and in about 10 minutes re-rout the wires to follow the old Satellite wiring path and was up and running. We instantly found fewer channels then we had before and an interface that seemed years behind what we had with our satellite provider.
After 10 days we started with the on line chat. After a few minute wait we explained our issue and gave the person both the account numbers and order numbers. He was unable to find our information and after several different attempts he finds the account and informs us he can not help us we need to call billing.
We did and after 20 minute in the Queue and another 15 minutes catching up the next person on the entire case we are told their system is down and we would need to call back.
We did and after 25 minutes in the Queue and another 10 minutes catching up the next person on the entire case we are told
to go back to the website. We ask to talk to a supervisor and being savvy we check the exact URL and find its the same one we tried before. We wait several minute just to have the person come back on the phone and tell us that the Call center supervisor would not be able to help us because the order was made on line. We demand to talk to a supervisor and after a few minutes he comes back tells us that we will be transferred and after about 5 more minutes the phone picks up. Then hangs up.
This time the chat person tells us that they are not able to help us either again and tries to send us to the 800- again. I decide to try the FCC and fill out there on line form. The run around is just too much and also go the Comcast.com and figure a quick e-mail to them will help too. I email 3 different groups. Rick, Customer service, and support. All say they give response in 24 hours. Ya.. That was a lie too.
After 24 hours we decide to try one last time.. We start with the chat being that we have been directed to both the chat and 800#. We are told after 25 minutes of chatting to call the 800# again. This time we let Derik know we are tired of the run around and inform him of our complaint to the FCC. We try to explain how we are asked to go call or talk to someone else each time, and that this is all over $109.90 that at this point no one even sees we have been charged for from Comcast. This despite the fact we can give them the order # and the account #.While in the chat we call the 800- number too. We find that our account is now "locked" and that only a supervisor can help us.. We still have not been contacted.

__label__0 Comcast is upgrading their network to provide consumers a better experience. This upgrade will cost consumers an additional $7/month. While I am not sure of the details of the upgrade, I suspect that the upgrade will benefit Comcast by enabling compression or other bandwidth savings, or provide better management or some other angle that directly benefits Comcast. This is the second 'upgrade' they performed that wound up costing consumers more. The first one was when they changed the signaling inside consumers homes. Before they did that, I was able to receive HDTV signals on any of my sets, and I didn't need a set-top box. After the upgrade, a set-top box is required (at a monthly cost). Which branch of government is responsible for allowing these large monopolies to continue to raise prices like this?
__label__1 I am looking at my phone right now... I have been on-hold 1 hour and 26 mins, spoke to two techs and it's been over a week with my problem.
__label__1 I have been a Comcast customer for about two years. My service is still the same as it was when I signed up for it. However, my bill never says the same and has been creeping up month after month. Comcast is an unethical company and I wonder there is no goddamn institution that can audit and regulate them. It seems to me our corrupt politicians are part of this on going corruption who gets paid by Comcast to pass law that protect its unethical practices. Comcast literary robs customers and no one can convict this institution. I have files complaint with FCC who simply forward the complaint to Comcast and at the end no resolution. They are all part of a bigger mafia that works against the public interest. We are all sick of it.
__label__5 Last month, I noticed my phone was not working. I called the Customer Service and reported my phone not working. I was told by the technician that I don't have that # anymore because they have given it to some other provider. I asked who gave the permission. They had no answer. All they can tell is someone called and said to do it. I asked, "Did you verify was that me?" They did not have an answer. I told him, "I am the primary account holder and I am supposed to make decisions, and I have not requested for any changes as I am satisfied with the present service, not to mention I believe I do pay my bill on or before the due date. So please correct this fault as soon as possible." I signed triple package on October 15th, 2010. It was 2 years which completes in November 2012. Then, we will be given new option for the next 2 years, which I am planning to do when the time arrives. So, please, correct this problem immediately. It will be greatly appreciated. Also, I have talked to many customer service supervisors. Everyone said they fixed or are fixing the problem but it has not been done yet.
__label__1 I wouldn't even give them one star! I have been trying to transfer services to my new house for over 6 weeks, with no results. I have spent countless hours on the phone, email, live chats and going by the local offices trying to get someone to listen to me. You just get the runaround and they transfer you to another department. You can never speak with anyone on a local level and the ** at the national level have no idea on what's going on half the time. It's a different story every time I call. The worst part is they don't care and they'll never be held accountable.
__label__1 I've been with Comcast since 2014. I've been happy with their services. This past September I received my bill and was very surprised when I saw the amount. They are charging me almost $1,000 for two old bills that are not mine. I explained to them that I did not live at the addresses that they stated. They told me that the last four digits of the social security did not match, only the name. I told them that I thought companies go by the social security number not the name. They have not removed these charges off my bill. Now they are threatening to cut off my services if I don't pay up $1200 by November 20. This is very inconvenient because I am a college student.
__label__1 I called Comcast in late July of 2014 to install an internet service in my home. I bought a modern and called them to activate my service. I was told that some was going to come by my house to check out the line coming into my house. I called back after 3 days but could not get my service turn on. I called back again and was told again that someone was going to be there in the next 2 days and they never did. This ordeal lasted for two weeks and still did not get my service turn on so, I told them to forget about it and I contacted a different internet provider.A month later, I received a bill from Comcast for $45.00 for internet usage. I called and told them that I never had their service but they continued to call me for past due bill. I called every possible departments in Comcast to complain about this bill but it never got resolved. At time, customer service person (Janice and Jose) will hang-up on me. Bottom line, I can't get this resolved and Comcast continued to harass me.
__label__1 Comcast is the consummate automated company where computer programs run the company and the people that work for it are useless. I was an internet customer for about 8 years when I decided to let them have my TV business and switched to the triple play when I moved on November 4th. Even though they were supposed to install me on the fifth my nightmare began learning the day before that they could not install me before December. I would never have changed my TV services to them if I knew that because I run my business with their internet services and I would surely be out of business if I were shut down for 30 days.I threatened to sue and started receiving action, finally promised installation of basic services for the internet by November 8th. The serviceman who came that day told me he couldn't install me and when I threatened to call his supervisor he began ripping up my walls looking for cable. He spent three hours here, did damage to the house and installed everything incorrectly. I put in a ticket for damages that has never been acted upon, even though I complained about it for separate times.The second service call the installation department advised me that due to the inconvenience they waived my installation fee. Because there was a wait I made crude connections to at least give me internet services, but experienced frequent outages because the wrong equipment was installed. On the second service call, a third was scheduled for the TV in all four rooms.They missed the third and fourth service calls and each missed appointment even with accelerated rescheduling you wait four or five days. Well to limit this to an amount that can be read on the eighth call they finally installed my TV services. But I still do not have the third part of Triple play three months later. I received my third bill on January 8th and noticed there was a second bill never sent. I learned that their automated service billed me three times for the same installation even though I was promised on the second call it would be free and noticed that none of the seven promised $20 credits were given. They have me owing them $750 for two months of service. I paid the first bill promptly.I can document speaking with five supervisors. They each acknowledge what was done wrong and that I was entitled to relief and each promised to make it right. But apparently Comcast strips supervisors of any meaningful authority and their automated billing system takes over. They never even sent me a complaint form for any of the problems I experienced. They just provide ticket numbers and no one has authority to do anything.I contacted a lawyer and intend to follow up with a complaint to Congress. Congress should look into them as possibly violating monopoly protections because they use their money and influence to steal business from competitors, where they don't honor the inducements. Unless you enjoy aggravation you should steer clear of Comcast Cable.
__label__1 Our small business has used Comcast for several years until this past summer when we started dealing with Brad ** as our Comcast Service Manager. When we looked at our bill, we discovered that Brad ** has signed us up for services and plans we never ordered or had a discussion about. It took several weeks for us to undo what Brad ** has done to our business. We have been with Sprint for about a month and am very happy with the transition process.
__label__1 We just moved into our new house and are trying to get a fence put in but have not been able to do so due to Comcast's cable lines running through our backyard. The wires are all exposed and pose a hazard to my family and pets. There is only one line running to our house. The other 10-15 lines are from other surrounding homes and business lines that are not ours. I have been trying to get in contact with Comcast for over a month now to get what is called a "down barrier". I have called over 6 times and put in multiple "priority tickets", and even had the Comcast technician who installed our new equipment call. I have been told numerous times that I would receive a callback in 24 hours, 48 hours, that someone would be out in 72 hours and NO ONE has ever called back or showed up.One employee actually forged our signature and signed off and saying that the ticket had been taken care of which is why our first two tickets were honored. I have given them over a month's notice to try to get this fixed. The fence is being put in tomorrow and now that I have finally gotten Comcast's attention (and someone fired in the process) they are saying I will be charged if anything happens to their cable lines and that they cannot be out until April 28th due to all the companies they must contact. As if that is my problem! I cannot even fathom how HORRIBLE Comcast's customer service is. I have been a loyal customer for over 5 years and pay a great deal of money for their service every month. It is absolutely ridiculous that they cannot even get someone you back. How can a company that large have such terrible customer service? They are, by far, the worst company to deal with.
__label__5 Every month we have the same issue with Comcast. They provide us with a monthly amount and as soon as the bill comes is another amount. We call every month and there's always the same answers that they don't know why, that they will make sure next bill is right but we have to pay what the bill says. Also they all over the phone making offers saying that they will give you a better offer and that you as a consumer won't have to pay more, but when the bill comes the same issue appears.
__label__1 Comcast is too massed produced. Where's the competition? There's no extra companies to choose from. Price is right but with a lack of customer service. This is not easy if you have problems or need to talk to someone. In the near future I will probably switch to satellite. Overall I'm not impressed with them. I would rate them zero stars for service and 2.5 for customer service. Overall each customer service representative has been excellent with their customer service. Assuming you can understand half of their representatives. Half the time I end up requesting to be transferred to another.Their phone tree is a slough of mess to keep you from talking to their agents. I spent 40 minutes talking to the computer to just contact a customer service representative. Only to end up down the wrong tree and ended up calling back multiple times. Not to mention you can end up waiting on hold for many minutes. Which can vary call to call. I recently moved to a new address and the area I moved into isn't "recognized" on their map. We had to be transferred to multiple agents before someone found it. Even though the contract is terminated at the other location we keep getting bills for it. Even though it says that particular location was terminated in their system.I've tried their tivo product(s) and ended up getting screwed on the contract because it wasn't clearly explained to me. It didn't help the customer rep kept pushing me to have it when I didn't want it. Not to mention all the upgrades they were pushing. I wanted to terminate it on the second week of having it. The customer service rep pushed me to "keep" it. Even though I requested not to. I called back the next month when I noticed the charge kept going through to the credit card. The agent said I waited too long to terminate it. They kept pushing me to keep it even though I no longer had the unit. I asked the person to terminate it but they wouldn't let me. I called back next month after another charge went through against my will. They finally listened to me when I told them "I will declare my credit card stolen if these unauthorized charges keep going through." It didn't help that they kept trying to push horrendous fees to terminate it. I thank them for terminating it but six months of this b.s. was ridiculous. I for one will never do tivo again.
__label__1 I'm just starting my own landscaping company and my customer asked me if I could bury his gutter spout, so of course I said yes. Well, I dug just a couple inches down and I accidentally severed the orange cable. Well of course I feel REALLY Bad but anyways, him and his wife are pharmacist and they NEED their computers. Well he called and they said they can't have anybody come out till THURSDAY!!! Well, needless to say they also have children and now they can't even watch tv. Well I'm writing this cause to save me and my new business I'm trying and struggling to build. I'm asking or begging is there anyone that works for Comcast. Is there anyway that one of you could make it out there to just fix just one wire I severed??? I literally beg one of you please!!! You can reach me at ** or email me at... **. To whomever helps me I can't thank you enough!!! GOD BLESS!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR Time...
__label__0 picked up cable box from novato comcast. Gave an old box with DVR and no hidef which is what I wanted. Found out I am being charged for a hidef box. Comcast says my box is hi def. it is not! it is an old box with No hd capability and my television is not even hidef capable. But they have been charging me 6.99 a month extra for a hi def service that I can't get because I don't have a hi def box and they are charging me an additional 6.99 to receive the hi def signal.  They just said sorry according to our records it is a hidef dvr box. Well I have a hidef dvr box on my 1080P television. The box I have on my old television is not the same it is a different make and model. The lady whom I got the box from at comcast specifically told me that this was not a hi def box. Good. That is exactly what I wanted.  A low def box with DVR capapbility.  Thats what I got but am being charged for a hideff box 6.99 and another 6.99 access fee.  $14.00 a month. Not only did they not fess up to their mistake, they wouldn't even go back and correct it. Then if I want someone to come out to correct the situation they want to charge me money to fix the situation. This is outragous. I have never worked with such an arrogant company. Monopolistic attitude is pervasive throughout this organization, but worse they think it is o.k. to steal from their customers. Unbelievable. $14.00 a month for the last 8 months for starters. $112.00.  29 minutes and 42 seconds of my life wasted trying to get to the bottom of these excessive charges.
__label__0 Comcast high-speed Internet is not high speed. It takes 1 minute to load 6MB - that is 0.1mps not the 20mps that is advertised. Nobody at Comcast can help. Save your money and get DSL.
__label__1 Intermittent to no internet service at all for over a week. 1 technician came. He did NOT do a proper root cause analysis. Change a small portion of cable. Force me to change modem (which was less than a month old) and the problem re-occurred less than a week later. One Comcast online tech admitted that Comcast cannot handle the internet traffic. Avoid Comcast as cable service provider, not worth $66.95 a month. Mr Roberts, CEO of Comcast has no understanding of customer service and he should start reading "Like A Virgin, Secrets They Won't Teach You at Business School" by Richard Branson if he wants to retain business/retain his job.
__label__1 I really cannot stand this company. Signed a contract in March 2015 for 24 months at 109.00 plus taxes and all the other happy **. Well in March of 2016 they raise my base bill $25.00. Explanation by the rep that is policy after a year. Why did I sign a contract for 2 years for? She didn't want hear it. So I filed a complaint with the FCC. Comcast got back with me, the rep said he will look into it and call me back later in the day. A week passed, I called and left a message, no return call. Finally called again and got the rep on the phone. He said he would lower the bill to what it was. My account online does not match what he said. I tried to call back, left a message and still no return call. Is this a way to run big company? I think not. Comcast needs to change their name to Comcrap.
__label__0 Replaced box and never worked.  They tell you managers will call you and they never do.  Tell you they will get someone out and no one shows.  Then find out never even entered work order.  Without cable and no indication will ever get it fixed.
__label__0 I went online to sign up for comcast cable and internet. When I put in my address and phone number the site says that both are available to me. I then called to schedule the connection and was told that I couldn't get it. I called 1800comcast to ask why. I was told by a lady that it was available to me and that they would call me back to schedule connection. In a couple days I called back. Andrea told me that there was no problem it was just never hooked up at this address and that they would schedule the appointment as soon as a tech was available. The next day Andrea called and left me a voicemail message stating that the tech said that there is not service down my road and they can't provide service to me. I called again on 9-2-08 to find out why they say I can get it and then say no. Patty told me that now they have it in the system as not servicable as of the 21st of Aug. She said the tech said that I am 4 miles from the service box. I think they should have to provide me with service after them telling me I can get cable and internet. I also have the email from Romeo stating that these services are available to me. I want them to provide me with cable and internet like they told me they could.I now have to use dial up and have no tv for my kids to watch. I am trying to work online and it is impossible to do so with dial up. I am losing money and I am a single mother with 13 and 14 year old daughters.
__label__1 I am so tired of Comcast. I had to move twice this summer. It was unfortunate but it's something I had to do. When I moved both times my bill was paid. However, when I go online to pay it for the next month there is a bill of $898.07 and there is no breakdown of how my bill actually amounted to that much. My bill is usually a little over $200 a month. So I called and chatted online to see what was going on. And they basically stated that the bill was created from my previous residence. I don't understand how that can be when I paid every month, how do I have a back payment of $420? They refuse to change the bill claiming that everything on my acct adds up to $898. Which is ridiculous because only Comcast can see the breakdown of my bill and I cannot see it on my end. I am so frustrated with this company. They just don't give a crap about the customer period.
__label__1 Where to begin. After having slow internet speed with Verizon in my husband and I's first home, we decided to transfer to Comcast. I believe this was the biggest mistake we could have made! We have had Comcast for a little over a month now. For some reason, all of the cable lines running to our home were cut, so Comcast had to fix the problem before we could get internet. In one week, we had scheduled for three different technicians to come to our home. Well, the first appointment was missed so we called that day after the scheduled time. We were told that they had cancelled our appointment and rescheduled it without telling us! So we waited about 3 days later for our second appointment. No one showed. We waited a couple hours past our appointment time and finally, someone showed. However, he was not doing what he was scheduled to do! We called Comcast and told them of our problem, that the technician did not know how the first appointment was missed and so he was working on preparing us for the third appointment instead of the second. They told us that they were at fault for not communicating to that technician. Finally, the third appointment day came and no one showed! We were so frustrated at this point that we called and spoke to the highest person up about what all has happened and demanded for their Comcast Customer Guarantee ($20 for each missed appointment). She said that $60 would be given to us and deducted from our bills. Being a little satisfied after that phone call, we waited about one more week until the last technician could come out and fix everyone's problems. This man was very disappointed with our service so far and therefore did more than what he was supposed to do and admitted that Comcast has horrible communication with their technicians. So for about two or three weeks, we had fantastic wireless internet speed until about a week and a half ago. Our internet speed has been incredibly slow. We have made several (9) phone calls to Comcast and every person reset our modem and told us that they do not know how else to help. Finally, we demanded for a technician to come out and check our end of everything. When he came out, he stayed for about an hour and a half checking to make sure that nothing wrong was coming from us. He checked both of our computers, our router and our modem. He even gave us a brand new modem for free just to ensure that nothing was wrong on our end! When he left, he stated that the IT department that Comcast works with created the problem and he sent in a ticket that would be corrected within the next 24 hours. Well, here we are 72 hours later with incredibly slow internet. For about a week and a half, we have had a download speed of between 0.08-0.26 (when we are paying for 24.0) and an upload speed of 4.5 (when we are paying for between 3-4). After the 24 hours was up, we called Comcast and were forwarded to the IT department, who was supposed to fix the problem they created. From India (where the IT department was based out of), we were told that they needed the right to charge us in order to discover where the problem is. I could have screamed! Both my husband and I had to talk to the IT department, who was very rude and inconsiderate. He said they saw the problem but the fact that we called him was because that we had the problem that they had to fix. We very politely told him that we were told that they created the problem and therefore we should not be charged for them to fix the problem that they created. After being interrupted many times from this man, we asked him to forward us to the highest possible person with Comcast. We were sent to the automatic voice when you call Comcast at the very beginning without the man saying a word to us before he left. We called one last time and they said that they would send out a technician, to do the same thing that was done 72 hours ago. Oh, and the $60 guaranteed by a higher up at Comcast and the Comcast Customer Guarantee was still never given to us - almost two months later. We cannot deal with this any longer, especially given that our college courses start in only four days! We won't even be able to download our class lectures with this horrible service. It is time to cancel service with Comcast now.
__label__1 We were charged for several months for movies we did not rent (porn). Our house was empty. We, at work. Our child, at school. Confirmed. The charges were not removed. We have spoken to others who have had similar experiences and left Comcast for competitors. We were given the same threat --pay up or be sent to collections?
__label__1 This is a 3 story residence, with extremely light internet activity, but I have experienced NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS with Comcast! I went to the extreme of paying an additional $12 a month to boost my internet speed, with absolutely NO positive changes or results. Furthermore...and mark my words: there is no solution. No matter how much money you pay to correct this - no matter how many calls you make to reset your modem (which I pay EXTRA for Comcast to provide) - NOTHING will make this situation better. The internet connection is so pathetic I OFTEN cannot even download a browser connection. Think twice before paying for their services! To be perfectly honest, I have spoken to some extremely accommodating representatives who have tried their damnedest to help me - but no matter how many amazing friendly representatives you reach, nothing, absolutely NOTHING resolves my issues with high speed internet. Think twice! I tell ya.
__label__1 There was a outage in my location. I called Comcast to see what was going on and how long the outage was going to take (I worked from home on this day and the Internet went out at 2:00 pm). I was informed that the outage was going to last until 11:00 pm. My response is how are you going to have an outage for nine hours and don't notify anyone. Comcast responded "This is for you... this will make your service better." At this time I wanted to speak to a manager because I wanted to complain about the process and I wanted it on record. The phone mysteriously hung up. So I called back and spoke with another person and went through the same thing.... well the phone mysteriously hung up again. At this point I am livid. I call back one more time and demanded to speak with a manager. I was put on hold for 20 minutes and the phone again mysteriously hung up. Comcast customer service is GARBAGE. I have to look at my options Comcast will not be in my future!
__label__1 I cancelled my service within the time frame to receive MY 30-day money back guarantee. This April and I still have not received my check. I've talked to several customer service representatives and all confirmed that it would be in 4-6 weeks. However, it's been two months now! When I called today the representative told me it was NEVER sent. What do you mean it was never sent??? HOW CAN YOU OPERATE A BUSINESS LIKE THIS? NO ONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE. So if you expect to work with a company of integrity, this is not the one. DO NOT TRUST THEM. If you work for Comcast quit. You are more than a crappy business with a terrible process.
__label__1 A few days ago, I spoke to a salesperson to get service. I agreed to pay $109 without phone service, and that was the deal I made with them, plus $12 extra in order for me to get 105 Mbps of internet speed. I was also charged for three boxes. When the technician showed up and set up my service in my home, I got 12 Mbps instead of 105 Mbps. When I asked him why this had happened, he said that I should call the company so they could send me a technician from a different department to get a booster so I could get the internet speed I originally paid for. One of the customer service representatives told me to go to Best Buy and purchase the booster since the company didn't have them anymore. Another representative told me that my area does not have 105 Mbps. Now I am getting confused because the salesperson told me that I could get 105 Mbps, and the website also says I can get 105 Mbps. But now, the customer service representative is telling me that I cannot reach 105 Mbps, so now I'm confused. I'm urging every Comcast customer to check their internet speed, and see if it's what they're paying for. Comcast lies about what they promise to provide, and overcharges!
__label__0 I have been unable to get into my email so I contacted comcast only to find out that a few days before they were tying to do an up grade in their smartzone(email) and apparantly something went wrong and now a lot of customers, like myself ares having problems getting in. When I contacted comcast, Which has been 3 days in a row now. First day I was told about the problem and we went through a walk around. It now takes me three steps and at least 3 tried to get into my email. The Second day, I was walked through a delete process of deleting several items, Then in the middle of restarting, everything went dead and I was totally disconnect and I had to call back. The Second indvidual did the same thing the first one did. Only this time he did give ne a ticket number. He also told me that he was hopeful that this will clear up in a few days. How's that for customer. I am paying good money for what is suppose to be a fast service and they can not get it correct. And per this individual I spoke with it has now been just about a week and the problem is still not cleared. Paying for a service that I am not getting. I count on my emails to keep in touch with my family that is out of state. Comcast is selling a sevice that they are not providing and are not compensating customers when they make mistakes. 
__label__1 For the past several weeks, I have been experiencing technical issues with Comcast in regards to the internet speed and the emails, which have been failed to be properly delivered in time.  I have been making several different calls back and forth for the last two weeks.  And I had two technicians come out and check out what was wrong with the internet.  They both came out and said that Comcast was having issues with the area and they had been experiencing problems.  Thinking my problem was being addressed to Comcast, I was more than patient. Two days ago, my emails weren't being sent out at all.  I contacted Comcast's customer service and asked to speak to a customer service representative.  Lenard is the name of the individual that attended my call.  Needless to say, he is the most unprofessional person I have ever spoken to.  He would not let me explain to him my problem and would only repeat that Comcast wasn't the one with the issue.  I was on the phone with him for about thirty minutes, until I got fed up with his lack of professionalism.  I asked to speak to a manager or someone of higher ranking.  He did not want to direct my phone call, telling me various times to say please and maybe he'll transfer me.  I am not playing games, nor am I acting a fool to be played with.  I have a business to take care of and an office to run.  The only thing I wanted was for someone to resolve my issue, not make matters worse.  He had me on the line for about forty five minutes after he put me on hold and said that he was going to direct me to a manager.  But he never did.  He finally hung up the phone call after having me wait more than an hour and I felt extremely insulted.  I am paying for my service.  Therefore, I expect for my problems to be addressed when they happen right away.  This was the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered.  If this keeps happening, I might just consider changing to another service provider.
__label__0 Misleading to sign-up for a new service  I was promised certain channels after specifically asking and confirming for those. And when I signed up for the service, I did not get them. Customer service after that was horrible, extremely rude.
__label__1 I have been a customer for nearly 2 years. This companys ONLY time of good prices is for the initial time period of a contract. After that the shake down begins, but also the service is HORRENDOUS!!! Very intermittent, never at the level that you are promised, but they charge you for it and brag about themselves as if their ads matter more than what they deliver. They beat you into submission because the only alternative is to block out five plus hours of your day for an incompetent technician to show up and basically change NOTHING... I know that most of the people using Comcast have no other choice or they wouldn't be here using it. This is the way it is. Like mafia the companies each mark out their territories and do their shakedowns... This is the one thing you can rely on with their services. You will be shaken down... period.Their service sucks. It is advisable to be very creative in your search for services before getting involved with them. It will become a headache you wish to avoid in no time at all. Wait lines for complaints are so long. This way the majority of us hang up before they have to be accountable... and like I say their technicians haven't got a clue what they are doing so a visit to your house is just a reminder of who is in charge so long as you are getting service from them.There are no basic services that are affordable. All there are is supposedly discounted services for the first year, which are high even to begin with, and then they trump up to ridiculous levels as the contract runs out. If only what they promised was what you got, but it isn't and trying to explain that, or get credits for it, well you have to put up with more home visits from their incompetent techs before they even talk to you about it. Their business relies on your not having a backup plan or ability to switch out. Don't go with this company. Try some creative start up. They just want your money through whatever creative means they can get it. Their services suck and are nothing to rely on, and nothing like as advertised!!!
__label__1 I just wasted the last 4 hours on the phone with Comcast and they are always giving you the run around. I have no choice but to have Comcast because there is no other service. Anyways, I just want to speak to someone who lives in the US and not overseas somewhere else.
__label__1 My cable went out on Jan 24th. I contacted Comcast, the earliest they could send a repair person was Friday, Jan 27th between 5-7pm. I called the next day and they were able to elevate me to between 3-5pm. I gave them my cell number since I was to be out most of the day. Thursday, I received a robocall confirming my appointment. Then Friday, around 2:30, another robocall to my home number, luckily my husband had returned home early and reconfirmed again!When there was no tech at 4pm, I called Comcast and was told the tech was running late but would be there soon. 5pm came and went, no tech. I called again after 6pm, the tech was still on the way, I ask for a supervisor, he will call me back. I wait 30 minutes, no supervisor call. I finally get a supervisor and am told the tech will call within 30 minutes. Guess what, no call. I call Comcast again and refuse to hang up until I get an answer, after 40 minutes, a supervisor gets on phone with me and goes into the call history. She then tells me the tech came to the house and no one was home! I then went ballistic. We were home since 2:45pm, the tech was suppose to call before coming, and never rang the bell or knocked on the door. It was Friday night, 7pm and just wanted to go home. The supervisor I spoke to about this also told me that I was scheduled for service Sunday 1-3pm. Another day wasted. She said, she would contact dispatch to try to elevate my service, that is Comcast babble for you are screwed. This is not the first time I have had problems with service calls from Comcast. And it should be my last, but I'm not sure any of the other companies are any better. You would think a multi billion dollar company would hire a few more techs to service their ever growing client base.
__label__1 My bill jumped $42 in April. I called Comcast to see how I could downgrade my service to lower my bill. I was told I had been overcharged and the new lower amount would be on my May bill. May's bill had not been changed. So I called back and after being connected to 5 different people, the rep. understood the problem and worked with me to get the bill down. After the call, the cable wouldn't work on my main t.v. I once again called Comcast. The rep tried to send a signal to restart the box to no avail. I'm writing this on Saturday and can't get a repair crew out here until next Friday. I refuse to take off work to get quicker service since I didn't cause the problem. The rep did say she would knock off $50 plus off my bill. It's pathetic when you call to change your service and end up with no service at all. This is not the first time I've had with Comcast.
__label__5 Touchton office in Jacksonville, FL. The normal interaction with Comcast via telephone is so predictably deplorable, time consuming, ill informed, hard to understand, etc etc. (I'll leave those posts to others.) This concerns the visit to the office today to return unneeded equipment since the person who wanted cable TV no longer lives here. There was no waiting time though I was told it is busier some days. April accepted the equipment. When I showed her the screen shot of an internet only special that the phone rep could not find or offer me, she tracked it down and not only found it but found one better and explained it to me. The experience of a few months back of returning their rented modem was equally painless and pleasant. If I could give more stars to this local Comcast office, and April in particular, I would.
__label__1 We recently moved into a new home and wanted cable, Internet, and home security. After being on the phone for 3 hours, we finally received a time for installation. THE TECHNICIAN DIDN'T SHOW UP!! After being on the phone for another 2 hours, we are still without another installation date and we have been on hold at least 10 times!!!
__label__1 Most recently, I have to call almost daily for repair or refresh signals. So far this month, I've had 3 appointments for the technician to come out & twice they were a no show. The problem has persisted for over almost two years, particularly since adding my neighbor's service to the same box located in my backyard. Either the TV cuts off or the phone & internet do not work. All Xfinity movies shut off midway and often will not resume. Also, if we watch more than a couple of movies during the billing period, we have to call first to get ok'd before purchasing the movie and watching it. The phone has terrible, intermittent service while talking, if it works at all. The cable box in the yard is rusted out, leaning over, and has exposed cable in the center of the box and above ground leading across my yard, under a fence, and into my neighbor's yard. Dogs are in these fenced areas and this is a real concern, plus my young grandchildren play outside when they visit. I've been told by several technicians over the past year that a work order was being placed to get this corrected and that's as far as it went.
__label__1 Minimally, it takes five minutes before you reach a live person due to their automated answering system. Some customer service representatives tell you one thing, but they do something quite different. For example, a credit that I was promised for loss of internet service (due to a defective modem) was never applied. This meant that I had to call them a second time. For more than a year, I had a defective modem. I never received the speed that I was being charged for. Sometimes, I would lose internet connectivity. When watching channels like Netflix, the program would repeatedly stop and buffer numerous times during the film. Comcast would not admit that their equipment was the problem until the modem broke down. Then, Comcast attempted to charge me for installation services when they sent a technician to my home to replace the defective modem. There is no local Comcast area in my town, so I have to make a 30 drive (in good traffic) to get to their center. It can take up to two or three hours of wait time for service depending on the time of day and the day week to pick up and/or drop off equipment. I am canceling my service with Comcast as soon as my contract expires in March 2017. I originally was with AT&T, but they no longer service my area. Comcast is a giant monopoly. Monopolies do not have to be responsible to the public they serve. Comcast/Xfinity does not care that their customer service personnel are rude and ignorant. Why? We the consumers have nowhere one else to go! A monopoly can set prices at whatever it wants (called "price fixing"). A monopoly creates inflation since they can set any price they want to. A monopoly can sell inferior products (e.g., their modem). A monopoly has no incentive whatsoever to provide better service and products because there is no competition. This is a very sad situation. Due to systematic deregulation by our ineffective US Congress, Comcast/Xfinity has been allowed to dominate and control the telecommunications market. I do not recommend this company to anyone.
__label__1 We signed up for Comcast a year ago and have had constant problems with their service. We have had to replace the router several times and have had to call and have so-called technicians attempt to repair inoperative boxes over the phone. We had installers break personal property and not care, trash our carpets, and not have components needed to complete the job. We was patient as long as we could be but after attempts to come to some compromise on the phone, now have to pay an additional 90 dollars to get out of the contract. Be advised; the product they promise and the one they deliver are completely different things. They are the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with.
__label__0 This is a scam, elderly abuse and fraud. They are complicating the accounting methods and then correcting it over the phone and changing it after we pay and then keeping that extra money for their pocket. I got a promotional price of $29.99 per month for 6 months, which comes to about $38 per month for 6 months. But somebody in accounting is reversing after correcting the paid bill and showing the balance in the next bill. I called again and after 15 minutes of talking to their supervisors, it is corrected to $38.00 and the supervisor said, Okay, now it is corrected so you can mail your payment and there will remain no balance in your account. I received a bill showing past balance of $89.07 and new charges of only $17.69 instead of $38.00; then, its showing a credit of $36.02, but it made a total due of $106.75. Very tricky accounting. They are cheating the elderly who do not understand simple accounting.I have been sending $38 per month, so how do I owe $106.76 now? It should be about the same amount of $38.00. This has been happening every month for the last 4 months and the supervisor corrected the amount over the phone and said to send that payment of $38 and I will owe nothing and we are even. Then the new bills arrived and showed no corrections. They are reversing it after the correction, cheating, and tricking. The same thing has been happening with AT&T. If you do not check, they will take your money and they got away with that. Strange thing is that the supervisors, accountants, and customer service all belong to one group and they are all crooks stealing from customers for their pockets. I rather blame Comcast for billing and accounting fraud. Thanks.
__label__1 I ordered Blast internet, yet that professional grade of internet never worked in our home. We had three techs agree that it wasn't working and never follow through with fixing it. I called to troubleshoot multiple times and told that it was working even though speed tests proved otherwise. My complaints were never noted and so I could not get money back for the non-existent service. Furthermore, it took me 1 hour and 46 minutes to cancel my cable because, shockingly, the man on the phone could not figure out how to do it. Instead he kept saying, "Please, I got you a great new deal. Just sign up for this because the cancellation is not working".
__label__0 Comcast customer service is miserable. If you're as unlucky as me and have to rely on this company because of a lack of alternatives than save yourself 30 minutes and don't bother calling up to ask them even the most simple billing questions. I just spoke with a CSR who couldn't explain the most basic question: where did a balance carry over on my bill come from. The CSR also didn't understand the difference  between a credit and a debit.  To top it off, she was the rudest person I have dealt with over the phone in a long time.  Just a colossal waste of time to wait half an hour just to get talked down to by someone who is supposed to help you.
__label__1 Comcast in Tucson is charging a base fee for their internet and limit the use to 350GB. ONCE you go over, they charge you $10 for each additional 50GB. NOBODY knows where all that data is going and/or coming from but they just keep charging. Internet from Comcast in Tucson, Arizona is being treated as if it was gasoline. There are NO extra charges, no extra effort to Comcast or by its employees. No reason for the cap of 350GB. They just do it. Dare you stream or share anything. They don't want you to use your smart TV. Dare you. These people are pirates and scumbags. NEVER ever get Internet from these people.
__label__0 Comcast has the WORST service department I have ever dealt with. I have taken off 18 days of work waiting for them and endless hours trying to set this up, and same problems with intermittent loss of phone and internet service still happens! Every time you call, they act as if this is the first complaint you have logged! I do not believe they know what they are doing! And you never get to talk with a supervisor or manager that can do anything more to help! This is the WORST I have ever experienced!!!! I HATE COMCAST!
__label__1 Comcast have the worse customer service in the world. Those idiots only want money. Their service is down most of the time and technicians are a joke, they don't have clue what their be doing. It's a damn shame this company is still in business.
__label__0 On Friday, October 2nd, I contacted Comcast on the phone to inquire about upgrading my internet service from my existing speed to the 50 Mb/second service. For those that do not know, this requires a cable modem that is DOCSIS 3.0 compliant. My existing cable modem is not DOCSIS 3.0 compliant, so I knew I needed a new cable modem. I am fully capable of installing equipment and getting line check information. I asked the Comcast representative on the phone what was required, and her initial response was that my service area was not upgraded to 50 Mb/second speeds. I informed her that it was as I knew someone in the area that had the service. She said she had to check and would call back.Five minutes later she called back and confirmed that, indeed, the service was available. She also informed me that it would cost $99/month; it would require renting a modem from Comcast at a monthly fee, and would require a $29.95 installation charge. I told her that I didn't want to pay $29.95 for someone to come in and disconnect my existing modem and hook up a new one as I could do that. She refused to waive the charge, and I told her that would cost Comcast $99/month of lost revenue. Researching on Comcast's website showed that the service fee was either $9.95 or $99.95 to connect to the 50 Mb/second service. I have no idea where the $29.95 fee came from. Later on that same day I made a post on Comcast's forums detailing my phone call experience. George, from Comcast, read the message and responded immediately that he would help.On Saturday, with George's suggestion, I had purchased the required modem and emailed George the MAC address. By Monday morning George had done a line test (remotely), I hooked up the new modem, and George provisioned it (remotely). By 10:30am on Monday I was running at the increased speeds with no installation fee. So, it appears that Comcast does have representatives that go that extra mile to make things right. I can understand the fees for those that are not able to do the installations. However, Comcast should be able to work with their customers to get them the service they want without unnecessary fees when those customers can do without a representative coming to the house.
__label__5 Comcast seems to get a lot of hate, but I have never had an issue with them. I've been a customer on and off for the past 12 years, and my parents were customers before that. My spouse was in the Army so we moved every 9-36 months. We got Comcast for our internet (and sometimes cable and phone) whenever we were in an area that Comcast offered service. Every charge was explained beforehand. Any service issues were fixed within 3 days (usually within hours or even minutes). Customer service representatives were always easy-to-understand and helpful. Internet speeds are decent (I can browse the internet, have the kids watch Netflix, and my husband and his friend can World of Warcraft on 2 different devices, all at the same time with no issues.)Installation is cheaper than some other companies (we can choose to do it ourselves and skip the fees). They are military-friendly. We have had to cut our contract short a few times due to unexpected (less than a month's notice) moves, and we were never charged a fee. They even offer services/bundles without a contract, so there is no cancellation fee. When we last had to move unexpectedly a few months ago, we were even able to get our Comcast Xfinity Internet and Cable switched the same day! Comcast isn't perfect, but in my experience, I (luckily) haven't had any serious issues.
